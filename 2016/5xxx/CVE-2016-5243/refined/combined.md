# USN-3051-1: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-93-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-93.140~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-93.140~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-93-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-93.140~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-93.140~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1485-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1485.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1485.112)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3057-1: Linux kernel (Qualcomm Snapdragon) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon Processors

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

                 CVE-2016-5244

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-7515, CVE-2016-2184, CVE-2016-2185, CVE-2016-2186,
CVE-2016-2187, CVE-2016-3136, CVE-2016-3137, CVE-2016-3138,
CVE-2016-3140

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that various USB
    drivers do not sufficiently validate USB descriptors.  This
    allowed a physically present user with a specially designed USB
    device to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2016-0821

    Solar Designer noted that the list 'poisoning' feature, intended
    to mitigate the effects of bugs in list manipulation in the
    kernel, used poison values within the range of virtual addresses
    that can be allocated by user processes.

CVE-2016-1237

    David Sinquin discovered that nfsd does not check permissions when
    setting ACLs, allowing users to grant themselves permissions to a
    file by setting the ACL.

CVE-2016-1583

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that the eCryptfs
    filesystem could be used together with the proc filesystem to
    cause a kernel stack overflow.  If the ecryptfs-utils package is
    installed, local users could exploit this, via the
    mount.ecryptfs_private program, for denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2117

    Justin Yackoski of Cryptonite discovered that the Atheros L2
    ethernet driver incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote
    attacker could take advantage of this flaw to obtain potentially
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2016-2143

    Marcin Koscielnicki discovered that the fork implementation in the
    Linux kernel on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four
    page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

CVE-2016-3070

    Jan Stancek of Red Hat discovered a local denial of service
    vulnerability in AIO handling.

CVE-2016-3134

    The Google Project Zero team found that the netfilter subsystem does
    not sufficiently validate filter table entries. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this for denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. Debian disables
    unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled with the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this allows privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-3156

    Solar Designer discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux
    kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects
    properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial
    of service (networking outage) in the host OS.

CVE-2016-3157 / XSA-171

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the x86_64 (amd64) task switching
    implementation did not correctly update the I/O permission level
    when running as a Xen paravirtual (PV) guest.  In some
    configurations this would allow local users to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2016-3672

    Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll noted that it was possible to disable
    Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) for x86_32 (i386) programs
    by removing the stack resource limit. This made it easier for local
    users to exploit security flaws in programs that have the setuid or
    setgid flag set.

CVE-2016-3951

    It was discovered that the cdc_ncm driver would free memory
    prematurely if certain errors occurred during its initialisation.
    This allowed a physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    escalate their privileges.

CVE-2016-3955

    Ignat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check
    the length of data received for a USB buffer.  This allowed denial
    of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured
    as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to
    impersonate it over the network.  A system configured as a usbip
    server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.

CVE-2016-3961 / XSA-174

    Vitaly Kuznetsov of Red Hat discovered that Linux allowed the use of
    hugetlbfs on x86 (i386 and amd64) systems even when running as a Xen
    paravirtualised (PV) guest, although Xen does not support huge
    pages. This allowed users with access to /dev/hugepages to cause a
    denial of service (crash) in the guest.

CVE-2016-4470

    David Howells of Red Hat discovered that a local user can trigger a
    flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of key lookups in the keychain
    subsystem, leading to a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-4482, CVE-2016-4485, CVE-2016-4486, CVE-2016-4569,
CVE-2016-4578, CVE-2016-4580, CVE-2016-5243, CVE-2016-5244

    Kangjie Lu reported that the USB devio, llc, rtnetlink, ALSA
    timer, x25, tipc, and rds facilities leaked information from the
    kernel stack.

CVE-2016-4565

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that various components
    in the InfiniBand stack implemented unusual semantics for the
    write() operation.  On a system with InfiniBand drivers loaded,
    local users could use this for denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-4581

    Tycho Andersen discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel
    did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local user can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2016-4805

    Baozeng Ding discovered a use-after-free in the generic PPP layer in
    the Linux kernel. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service (system crash), or potentially escalate
    their privileges.

CVE-2016-4913

    Al Viro found that the ISO9660 filesystem implementation did not
    correctly count the length of certain invalid name entries.
    Reading a directory containing such name entries would leak
    information from kernel memory.  Users permitted to mount disks or
    disk images could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2016-4997 / CVE-2016-4998

    Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that missing input sanitising
    in Netfilter socket handling may result in denial of service. Debian
    disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled
    with the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this also allows
    privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# USN-3056-1: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1019-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.4.0-1019.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1019.25)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1343335#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-07 07:41:50 UTC  ```  A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel.  There is a char array of size 60 in function tipc_nl_compat_link_dump of file net/tipc/netlink_compat.c, link_info.str. Memory after the NULL byte is not initialized. Sending the whole object out can cause a leak of sensitive info in kernel stack.

# USN-3052-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

# USN-3053-1: Linux kernel (Vivid HWE) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid for Trusty

## Details

A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A

local user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an

ACL. ([CVE-2016-1237](/security/CVE-2016-1237))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-3.19.0-66-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid)
  -
  [3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid/3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1)

  -
  [3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid/3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-66-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid)
  -
  [3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid/3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1)

* [linux-image-3.19.0-66-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid)
  -
  [3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid/3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-66-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid)
  -
  [3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid/3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-66-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid)

  [3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-vivid/3.19.0-66.74~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3054-1: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
