## ReadyDesk contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#294272

Original Release Date: 2016-08-16 | Last Revised: 2016-08-16

---

### Overview

ReadyDesk, version 9.1 and possibly others, contains SQL injection, path traversal, hard-coded cryptographic key, and arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities that may be leveraged to expose sensitive data and execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable software.

### Description

| [ReadyDesk](http://www.readydesk.com/) is a help desk ticketing web application designed to facilitate business internal or business to customer interactions.  [**CWE-89**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a SQL Command ('SQL Injection') -** CVE-2016-5048The user name field of http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/staff/default.aspx fails to properly escape single quote characters, or ', provided as field input. Through error-based, blind SQL injection attacks, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may obtain full database contents, including user passwords which are stored as SHA1 hashes.[**CWE-22**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory -** CVE-2016-5049The SESID parameter of requests to http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/openattach.aspx is vulnerable to directory traversal and may be exploited to read arbitrary files on affected systems when combined with the FNAME parameter. For instance, to download SQL\_Config.aspx, an attacker would make a request to:http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/openattach.aspx?SESID=..\..\hd\data&FNAME=SQL\_Config.aspx[**CWE-321**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key -** CVE-2016-5683SQL Server user credentials stored in SQL\_Config.aspx are encrypted using a hard-coded cryptographic key found in ReadyDesk.dll. An attacker capable of obtaining the encrypted password can easily decrypt it for use in further attacks.[**CWE-434**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type -** CVE-2016-5050Files uploaded via http://<IP>/readydesk/chat/sendfile.aspx are not properly validated, allowing for arbitrary upload of files with a dangerous type. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code by uploading and making a request to a specially crafted aspx page.The CVE score below describes CVE-2016-5050. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can obtain sensitive database information, read arbitrary files, and execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable software. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to these problems. A vendor [advisory for version 9.2](http://readydesk.com/news.asp?ID=88) states that it contains "Critical Security Updates," though details are not provided and it is unknown whether any of the vulnerabilities described above are addressed. |
