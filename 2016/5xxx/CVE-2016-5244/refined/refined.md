{
  "CVE-2016-5244": {
    "description": "The rds_inc_info_copy function in net/rds/recv.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 does not initialize a certain structure member, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory by reading an RDS message.",
    "root_cause": "The `flags` field within the `minfo` struct in the `rds_inc_info_copy` function is not initialized before being copied out. This lack of initialization leads to exposure of kernel stack data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Missing Initialization"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory. This can leak confidential data from kernel to userspace",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted RDS message"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with ability to send a specially crafted RDS message."
