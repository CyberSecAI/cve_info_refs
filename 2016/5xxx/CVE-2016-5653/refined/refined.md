- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability in the "ID" and "Branch" parameters of a search function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated but low-privileged user can exploit the SQL injection to enumerate the full database.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, by manipulating the "ID" and "Branch" parameters of a search request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated but low-privileged user.
