Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5096:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, specifically the messages from openwall.com and the Red Hat Bugzilla entry, directly link the vulnerability to **CVE-2016-5096**. The subject line "Re: Fwd: CVE for PHP 5.5.36 issues" within the Openwall content confirms that the assigned CVE is indeed for a PHP vulnerability. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry explicitly states "(CVE-2016-5096) php: Integer underflow causing arbitrary null write in fread/gzread", matching the CVE description. The message also includes links to the upstream bug report and patch. Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2016-5096.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is an **integer underflow** that occurs when the `fread` or `gzread` functions in PHP are called with an excessively large `$length` argument value (greater than 2GB or 2<sup>31</sup>). This underflow leads to an incorrect calculation of the memory allocation size resulting in an arbitrary null byte write.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Underflow:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the `len` parameter, a `long` value, before it's used in calculations and memory allocation within `fread` and `gzread`. This can cause the calculation `len + 1` to wrap around to a small positive or negative integer, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Null Write:** Due to integer underflow, the calculated memory location where a null byte is written goes out of the allocated buffer, resulting in an arbitrary memory write.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary memory write:** The core impact of this vulnerability is the ability to write a null byte to an arbitrary memory location, which can lead to various issues:
    *   **Application Crash:**  As noted in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry, this can lead to crashes, though on "standard non-ASAN builds, it's very unlikely to cause a crash." The crash occurs due to invalid memory access.
    *   **Potential Code Execution:** It is theoretically possible in certain circumstances to achieve arbitrary code execution by carefully crafting the location where the null byte is written.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by calling `fread` or `gzread` with an extremely large `$length` parameter.
*   An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by manipulating the value of the `$length` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Control over `$length`:** The attacker needs control or the ability to influence the value of the `$length` argument passed to `fread` or `gzread`. This could be through a vulnerable web application using these functions directly or indirectly.
*   **Large Memory Allocation:** The attacker needs to trigger the vulnerability in a PHP environment with a sufficiently high `memory_limit` setting (greater than 2GB), or with no memory limit. As noted in the Red Hat bugzilla entry, setting the `memory_limit` to 128M mitigates the issue because "this flaw can only be triggered when PHP is running with no memory limit, or its memory limit exceeds 2GB."

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry highlights that the vulnerability is primarily triggered in environments where PHP's memory limit is set to 2GB or higher.
*   The Red Hat fix for this issue was included in their security advisory RHSA-2016:2750, impacting multiple Red Hat Software Collections.
* The bug report from php.net also indicates the issue was resolved in PHP versions 5.5.36, 5.6.22 and later versions.
* ASAN reports have been used to track and fix this vulnerability

In summary, CVE-2016-5096 is a vulnerability in the `fread` and `gzread` functions of PHP where an integer underflow leads to an arbitrary null write. This vulnerability can be exploited by providing large values for the length argument of these functions when the `memory_limit` is high or unlimited.
