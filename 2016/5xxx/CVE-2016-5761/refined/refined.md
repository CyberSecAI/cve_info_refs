Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a failure to sanitize user-controlled input when displaying email content in GroupWise WebAccess. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the message viewer handles HTML email content, allowing for the embedding of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code injected into an email can be stored and then executed when a user views that email in GroupWise WebAccess.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Compromise:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute JavaScript code within the context of an authenticated user's session.
*   **Browser-Based Attacks:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to perform other browser-based attacks, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information, account hijacking, or further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Injection:** An attacker sends a specially crafted email containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within an HTML link or similar construct.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the malicious email, specifically by clicking on the embedded link within the email using GroupWise WebAccess.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Email Sending Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send emails to the target user, or to a group the target user is a member of.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft a malicious email that can be properly rendered and exploited through GroupWise WebAccess.
*   **No Authentication Required to Exploit:** An attacker does not require valid user credentials to send a malicious email.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Wolfgang Ettlinger of SEC Consult.
*   The vulnerability affects GroupWise 2014 R2 and 2014, and possibly older unsupported versions.
*   The fix is available in GroupWise 2014 R2 SP1 Hot Patch 1 (or later).
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is included, showing how a malicious link can be embedded to execute Javascript.
