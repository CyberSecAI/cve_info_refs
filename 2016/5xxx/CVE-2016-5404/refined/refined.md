Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `cert_revoke` command in FreeIPA incorrectly handles access errors. Instead of properly enforcing the 'revoke certificate' permission, it falls back to invoking the `cert_show` command. If `cert_show` executes successfully, `cert_revoke` proceeds, effectively bypassing the permission check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Privilege Check:** The core issue is that the 'revoke certificate' permission is not adequately enforced.
- **Permission Bypass:** Users with 'retrieve certificate' permission can effectively revoke certificates by exploiting the flaw in `cert_revoke`'s error handling logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers with 'retrieve certificate' permissions can revoke any certificate, leading to various forms of DoS. For example, revoking critical certificates could disrupt services and operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker logs in with 'retrieve certificate' permission.
- The attacker then exploits the flaw in the `cert_revoke` command to revoke certificates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account in FreeIPA.
- The attacker must have the 'retrieve certificate' permission enabled for their account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with Identity Management (IdM).
- Patches were created for various FreeIPA versions (4.4, 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 3.0, and 2.1).
- The fix was included in the `freeipa` package update for Fedora 23, 24, and 25.
- The fix was also included in the RHSA-2016:1797 errata for RHEL.
- The fix involves correcting the permission check logic in the `cert_revoke` command to ensure proper enforcement of 'revoke certificate' permission.
