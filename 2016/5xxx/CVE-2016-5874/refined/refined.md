- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption due to specially crafted packets sent to specific TCP ports, leading to a denial-of-service condition in the OPC-Unified Architecture (UA) service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Resource Exhaustion (CWE-400). The software does not properly handle malicious or malformed packets sent to specific ports, resulting in excessive resource consumption and ultimately a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, requiring a manual restart of the service to restore functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted packets to specific TCP ports (55101-55105, 4845, and 4847-4850).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low skill can remotely exploit the vulnerability. No specific user interaction or privileges are needed.
