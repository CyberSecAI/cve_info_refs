- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper input validation or access control, allowing a crafted HTTP request to bypass normal security measures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to obtain sensitive user data through a specially crafted HTTP request. This suggests a weakness in access controls and/or input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can obtain sensitive user data. The impact is limited to a loss of confidentiality, as indicated by the CVSS vector.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, leveraging specially crafted HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.
