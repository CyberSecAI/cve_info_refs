  "CVE-2016-5140": {
    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the opj_j2k_read_SQcd_SQcc function in j2k.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By processing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a victim to process a malicious JPEG2000 image, either by tricking them into viewing it directly or embedding it within another document or web page. A network connection to a target running a vulnerable application is required."
