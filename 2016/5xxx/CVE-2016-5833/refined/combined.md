# WordPress 4.5.3 Maintenance and Security Release

---

WordPress 4.5.3 is now available. This is a **security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

WordPress versions 4.5.2 and earlier are affected by several security issues: redirect bypass in the customizer, reported by [Yassine Aboukir](http://yassineaboukir.com); two different XSS problems via attachment names, reported by [Jouko Pynnönen](https://klikki.fi/) and [Divyesh Prajapati](https://twitter.com/divy_er); revision history information disclosure, reported independently by [John Blackbourn](https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion/) from the WordPress security team and by Dan Moen from the Wordfence Research Team; oEmbed denial of service reported by Jennifer Dodd from Automattic; unauthorized category removal from a post, reported by David Herrera from [Alley Interactive](https://www.alleyinteractive.com/); password change via stolen cookie, reported by [Michael Adams](https://blogwaffe.com/) from the WordPress security team; and some less secure `sanitize_file_name` edge cases reported by [Peter Westwood](http://peter.westwood.name/) of  the WordPress security team.

Thank you to the reporters for practicing [responsible disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/).

In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.5.3 fixes 17 bugs from 4.5, 4.5.1 and 4.5.2. For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.5.3) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=4.5.3).

[Download WordPress 4.5.3](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.5.3.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.5.3:
