Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5749

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper parsing of incoming XML requests by the NetIQ Access Manager (NAM) Identity Server. Specifically, the server doesn't adequately validate external DTD (Document Type Definition) references within the XML, leading to an XXE (XML External Entity) injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject external DTD references into XML requests. This allows an attacker to make the server parse and load external entities, which can be arbitrary files.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The NAM Identity Server fails to properly validate or sanitize the incoming XML data before processing it. Specifically, it doesn't prevent the inclusion of external DTD references.
- **Missing Signature Validation:** The vulnerability is exploitable when signature validation is disabled. Enabling signature validation is suggested as a workaround, indicating that this check, when active, would prevent the XXE injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:**  An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. In the example given, the attacker was able to read `/etc/passwd`.  Any readable file on the host system can potentially be accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious XML request, specifically a SAML AuthnRequest, which contains a `DOCTYPE` declaration referencing an external DTD file hosted on a server controlled by the attacker.
- **Unauthenticated Requests:**  The attack is possible with unauthenticated requests, making it easy for an attacker to trigger the vulnerability without prior access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NAM Identity Server.
- **External Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host a malicious DTD file.

**Technical Details:**

The provided example clarifies how the attack works.
1. **Malicious DTD:** The attacker creates a custom DTD file with an entity that attempts to read a local file.
2. **Crafted XML:**  The attacker creates a SAML AuthnRequest XML message that includes a `DOCTYPE` declaration referencing the custom DTD.
3. **Vulnerable Server Processing:** The NAM Identity Server, upon processing this request, fetches and processes the referenced DTD, causing the server to read and attempt to include the content of the specified local file.

**Resolution:**
- **Apply Patches:** The recommended solution is to apply the relevant patch or hotfix for the affected versions. Specifically, NAM 4.2.2 for NAM 4.2 and NAM 4.1.2 HF 1 for NAM 4.1.
- **Enable Signature Validation:** As a temporary workaround, enable signature validation on the Identity Server for all trusted Service Providers.
