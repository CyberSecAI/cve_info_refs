```
Root cause of vulnerability: User's first and last names are not sanitized when sending emails.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Text injection in email headers.
Impact of exploitation: A registered user can inject arbitrary email addresses in the emails that Moodle sends. This can be used to send spam when Moodle emails user content such as messages and forum posts.
Attack vectors: By changing their own name, a registered user can inject arbitrary email addresses into email headers.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a registered user.
