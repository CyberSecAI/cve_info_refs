Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android handles the display of the URL bar and SSL indicators during page loads, specifically when a new page load is disrupted or fails. The browser sets the URL in the URL bar immediately after user input for visual feedback, before receiving confirmation that the new page has loaded, and before the previous page’s SSL indicator is cleared. If a load fails (e.g. due to an invalid javascript: URL), the browser doesn't receive a location change event to trigger a reset, leaving the previous site’s SSL indicator and potentially incorrect URL displayed, leading to a spoofing condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent state management:** The browser displays the entered URL in the URL bar without waiting for confirmation that the new location has actually loaded.
*   **Failure to reset site identity:** On a failed load (such as a malformed javascript URL), the browser does not clear the previous site's SSL indicator and favicon.
*  **Favicon in URL bar:** The presence of the favicon in the URL bar allows a malicious website to use a green lock icon as a favicon, deceiving users into believing they are on a secure site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSL Spoofing:** An attacker can trick a user into believing they are on a secure site by displaying a misleading SSL indicator (lock icon) from a previous secure page, even if the current content is not secure, or is a javascript URL.
*   **URL Spoofing:** The URL bar may display an incorrect URL, misleading the user about the actual page they are visiting.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JavaScript URLs:** An attacker can craft a malicious link containing a malformed "javascript:" URL. When a user navigates to this link, the load fails. This results in the previous site's security indicators remaining displayed while the address bar shows the injected URL.
* **Pasting and Go:** User pastes the malicious javascript URL into the URL bar and hits "Go."
* **Other Load Failures**: Other types of load errors can potentially cause the same effect of failing to clear the old lock state. This includes scenarios where a URL returns a 204 error, or when the URL never answers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to present a link or have the user paste a specially crafted URL (e.g. a malformed javascript: URL) into the address bar.
* The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, this is a client side vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects Firefox for Android, while desktop versions of Firefox are not affected.
*  The issue was rated as a "sec-moderate" severity bug and was fixed in Firefox 50.
* The vulnerability is not exploitable in the sense that the malicious javascript doesn't run, and the user is still on the previous page. The spoofing occurs due to the inconsistent URL display during the failed load of the javascript URL.
