Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-5807:

**Root Cause:** Forced Browsing (CWE-425)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   A low-privileged user can access and modify parameters that should only be accessible to an administrator.
*   The system lacks proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users to directly request and manipulate resources they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive settings.
*   An attacker can change privileged parameters.
*   Potential for high impact on confidentiality and integrity

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is network-based, meaning it can be carried out remotely.
*   Exploitation is achievable by low-privileged users who can directly send requests to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   The attacker requires low-level user access.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send specific requests directly to the web application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory states that an attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   No known public exploits are specifically targeting these vulnerabilities at the time of the advisory.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 8.1, indicating a high severity.

This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to bypass access controls and manipulate privileged parameters, representing a significant security risk.
