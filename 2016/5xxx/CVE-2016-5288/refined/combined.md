This seems fixed in my testing on beta and later, but in 49 without electrolysis the test case works:
<https://cdn.cliqz.com/browser-f/fun-demo/xkcd.html>
What happens is that after a while (or immediately in a rather empty profile) the page displays the contents of about:cache instead of the XKCD comic. Remember you need to disable e10s for this attack to work. This came from our partners at Cliqz and they also have an additional demo attack page that uses a service worker to outlive the tab and keep sending the private data in the background.
If my testing is correct, can someone find out which patch actually fixed this and whether we should release a hotfix?
[Bug 1195757](/show_bug.cgi?id=1195757 "VERIFIED FIXED - [Control Center] about:cache shows \"Connection is not secure\"") and [bug 1253673](/show_bug.cgi?id=1253673 "RESOLVED FIXED - bypass FireFox Secure Connection Failed prompt to whitelist any site (but doesn't work)") seem to be related, but the release information doesn't correspond with my testing.
CCing Gijs and Tanvi in case they know the answer already.

Regression range for when this became possible (it wasn't possible on 48, in my testing, and I also can't make it work on 50, as noted in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1310183#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remote web content can read about:cache entries in 49")):

I suspect this regressed through [bug 1275898](/show_bug.cgi?id=1275898 "RESOLVED FIXED - about:cache channels must start pumping only after AsyncOpen being called on them"), and then (looking at "hg log" for nsAboutCache.cpp) was probably fixed in [bug 1282750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Convert AboutCache to use AsyncOpen2()"). I'll verify as soon as I can.
If I'm right, this isn't a URI flag issue, but an issue with the asyncopen implementation of about:cache not doing what it's supposed to do. I don't know why it isn't implemented as just another html page and goes through the normal about: code. Probably worth verifying that the checks are now correct when compared to the normal about: code, and if we have any other "manually implemented" handlers for particular about pages.Group: firefox-core-security → core-security-releaseComponent: Security → Networking: CacheProduct: Firefox → Core

So I think it is indeed [bug 1282750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Convert AboutCache to use AsyncOpen2()") that fixed this. Not marking deps because if we don't fix this on 49 I don't want to publicize the regressor and fixing bugs are linked to a sec-sensitive bug.

Thanks for tracking this! I actually re-routed AsyncOpen2 to AsyncOpen in [bug 1275898](/show_bug.cgi?id=1275898 "RESOLVED FIXED - about:cache channels must start pumping only after AsyncOpen being called on them"). Ups. Still I think I just copied that from somewhere else... not sure where, but I expect that place to be fixed now too.
Thanks again.

Liz: This is a pretty horrible information disclosure bug -- the URLs in the cache contain a lot of potentially private information, both the sites you're visiting and possibly passwords or session IDs etc in parameters. If there's any way to slip this safe/small fix into a 49 update we should; three weeks is a long time to wait for spillage this bad.
How did the cliqz folks find this?!

FWIW, looking at <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=NS_ABOUT_MODULE_CONTRACTID_PREFIX> I think about:cache and about:blank are the only special cases here.
Christoph, any chance you can double-triple-check that the checks asyncopen and friends do are now fully correct? What about the suggestion in [comment #18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1310183#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remote web content can read about:cache entries in 49") that there were other places where we redirected asyncopen2 to asyncopen and dropped security checks, as it were? How many of these implementations are there and is it possible to audit we're not doing anything dumb anywhere else? (I'd do this myself but I don't have a lot of cycles right now and also am not 100% sure what bit of the changes is responsible for fixing this). Note that actually, looking at this:
if (!mChannel) {
return NS\_ERROR\_UNEXPECTED;
}
// Kick the walk loop.
rv = VisitNextStorage();
if (NS\_FAILED(rv)) return rv;
- rv = mChannel->AsyncOpen(aListener, aContext);
+ MOZ\_ASSERT(!aContext, "asyncOpen2() does not take a context argument");
+ rv = NS\_MaybeOpenChannelUsingAsyncOpen2(mChannel, aListener);
it kind of looks like we're still doing stuff (VisitNextStorage) even before we try to use asyncopen2 and would potentially bail out for security reasons? Shouldn't that be in reverse order?
It looks like <https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/4306097418bf> is a straight graft onto release on a unified tree (checked locally), so it would be straightforward to take it from that perspective. Liz, per [comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1310183#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remote web content can read about:cache entries in 49"), can we make this happen?Flags: needinfo?(lhenry)Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Yes, you can swap these. There is no risk in it. Both just start an async operation, doesn't matter in which order that should happen.

Daniel, Gijs, We can make this happen if I do a build 2 today and we test again and release tomorrow. Can you request uplift in [Bug 1282750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Convert AboutCache to use AsyncOpen2()")? How can we test this (or make sure it doesn't break something else?)

If you are sure of your fix let's land it today. If you are still exploring and need another day, then I can delay the dot release till Friday. But please let us know.Flags: needinfo?(lhenry) → needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Summary for our IRC discussion.
1) NS\_MaybeOpenChannelUsingAsyncOpen2() landed in FF50.
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/063d90be43fc#l3.47>
Inlining the three lines of code works however, we do that in other places.
2) In 99.9% the channel has a loadInfo attached (with the right securityflags) and hence security checks will be executed as intended. We have assertions within our codebase to make sure all channels (besides docshell loads at this point; which are loads of TYPE\_DOCUMENT) have a loadinfo attached. The only time it can happen that a channel does not have a loadInfo attached is when an addon implements NewChannel2() and does not attach a Loadinfo, see [1]. Please note that this can't happen for compiled addons, only for JS implemented NewChannel2() implementations. I doubt there are that many that implement NewChannel2() but don't attach a loadInfo. Please further note, that if an addon just implements NewChannel() [not NewChannel2()] our wrapping mechanisms kicks in [1] and security checks are again performed as intended.

It wasn't reproducible on 48 on nightly, but [bug 1275898](/show_bug.cgi?id=1275898 "RESOLVED FIXED - about:cache channels must start pumping only after AsyncOpen being called on them") was uplifted to 48 while on aurora, which explains the discrepancy.
It would still be nice if they can also verify that this is gone on 50.

He did confirm 50 was unaffected when I was there. As to how he found it, keep in mind they are building a very privacy-centric product. In his own words:
"I came across this while testing the caches in FF / CLIQZ to see what kind of privacy concerns could be there; given an extension or an adversary has access to the same, that’s when I started to goof around about:cache through XMLHttpRequest and Fetch and was able to access it from an external webpage."Flags: needinfo?(past)

the crash first started to appear on 2016-10-10 with various different beta versions though, so some external factor may play into this as well.

I would have guessed this was introduced in [bug 1093357](/show_bug.cgi?id=1093357 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement a cross-process pipe"), but that landed in FF49.
I think I see the problem, though:
if (!aConsumedByIPC) {
Unused << fdSetActor->Send\_\_delete\_\_(fdSetActor);
}
// FileDescriptorSet doesn't clear its fds in its ActorDestroy, so we
// unconditionally forget them here. The fds themselves are auto-closed in
// ~FileDescriptor since they originated in this process.
fdSetActor->ForgetFileDescriptors(fds);
We should delete the actor after telling it to forget its file descriptors.Assignee: nobody → bkellyStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(bkelly)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1309823&attachment=8800794)

I think this is a pretty clear ordering violation. We must call the method on the actor before starting its deletion.

This bug has 49 as unaffected. So it doesn't sound like a candidate for a dot release.
Also, this should have sec approval though before it lands if you think 51/52 are also affected.Flags: needinfo?(lhenry)

Forget file descriptors before starting actor destruction. r=billm
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Moderately difficult. They would have to understand the implication that Send\_\_delete\_\_() can immediately delete an actor and how this ipc/glue code is called.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think the commit message includes any more information then the patch. It references "destruction", but I am moving a method that includes "delete" in its name.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
FF49+
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 1093357](/show_bug.cgi?id=1093357 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement a cross-process pipe")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should apply cleanly.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Minimal risk. Its reordering two calls. We've fixed similar bugs in the past with changes almost identical to this.
I've also done a try build with an obscured patch name/message:

Liz, it was marked 49 unaffected because the crashes are not showing there. The bug that introduced the flaw did land in FF49, though. If no other point release was happening I probably would not push for one. But I think it would be prudent to do this as a ride-along.Flags: needinfo?(lhenry)

Based on [bug 1093357](/show_bug.cgi?id=1093357 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement a cross-process pipe") I'm going to mark FF49 affected.

Hi Ben, this is another crash signature that is trending up in Beta50. <https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/signature/?date=%3C2016-10-17T17%3A10%3A00%2B00%3A00&date=%3E%3D2016-10-10T17%3A10%3A00%2B00%3A00&product=Firefox&version=50.0b&signature=nsTArray_base%3CT%3E%3A%3ASwapArrayElements%3CT%3E%20%7C%20nsTArray_Impl%3CT%3E%3A%3ASwapElements%3CT%3E%20%7C%20mozilla%3A%3Aipc%3A%3AFileDescriptorSetParent%3A%3AForgetFileDescriptors>

It should be fixed with the patches landed here. What beta do we expect this fix to be included in? I thought it would be in 50b7, but maybe I was confused.Flags: needinfo?(bkelly)

Ah, I see FF50b7 was built from this push:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/6efc0964ec62bc4abfdc4cb1dc7cc461c3238634>
Which does not seem to include this bug's patch yet. So I am hopeful both these crashes will be fixed by this patch.

A number of service worker related intermittents seem to have dropped off to zero over the weekend as well. Hoping that those are all fixed by this.
