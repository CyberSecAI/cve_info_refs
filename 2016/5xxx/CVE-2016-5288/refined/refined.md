      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to an issue with the asyncOpen implementation of about:cache, which didn't properly handle security checks when accessed from remote web content. This allowed the remote web content to read about:cache entries.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper access control",
           "Information Disclosure"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote web content could read the contents of about:cache, potentially exposing private information like visited URLs, passwords, and session IDs.",
        "attackVectors": "The attack vector involves a specially crafted webpage that uses XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to access the about:cache page. This only works if e10s (Electrolysis) is disabled.",
        "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious code into a website visited by the victim. The victim must also have e10s disabled in Firefox."
