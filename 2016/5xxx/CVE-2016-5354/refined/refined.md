    "Description": "The Wireshark USB dissector can crash due to a NULL pointer dereference when processing malformed packets.",
    "Root cause": "The USB dissectors did not properly check if the class type matched the expected dissector before accessing data, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malformed USB packet can cause Wireshark to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed USB packet onto the network",
      "Convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to inject malformed USB packets onto the network being captured, or they need to be able to convince a user to open a malicious capture file."
