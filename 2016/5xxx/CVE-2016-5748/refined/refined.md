Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5748

**Product:** NetIQ Access Manager (NAM) versions 4.1 and 4.2, specifically the Identity Server component.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw present in the risk servlet (/nidp/test/risk) of the Identity Server. The risk servlet is a tool intended for administrators and users to verify risk scores related to risk-based authentication. The accompanying risk.jsp page can be modified to trigger the XXE vulnerability by changing the DTD file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and process external entities in the XML parsing process. By crafting a malicious DTD and referencing it in the risk.jsp file, an attacker can cause the server to process arbitrary external entities leading to various attacks.
*   **Unrestricted File Access:** Through XXE, the attacker can read arbitrary files on the IDP server, including sensitive system files like /etc/passwd.
*   **Remote DTD Retrieval**: The risk.jsp can be modified to point to a DTD file located on a remote web server, allowing an attacker to host and control the malicious DTD, further extending the attack surface and allowing for more complex attacks

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the IDP server's file system, potentially including configuration files, credentials, and user data.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Ability to read any readable file on the IDP server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Modification:**  An attacker needs to modify the `risk.jsp` file located at `/opt/novell/nids/lib/webapp/jsp/risk.jsp` to change the default DTD file (loose.dtd) to point to a malicious DTD.
*   **Risk Servlet Access:** The attacker then needs to access the risk servlet via the URL (`https://<IDP_server_domain>/nidp/test/risk`) to trigger the processing of the malicious DTD.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to the IDP server's file system to modify the vulnerable risk.jsp file.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the IDP server to access the risk servlet.
*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious DTD file when exploiting a remote DTD retrieval.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Patching:** Apply the official patches: Access Manager 4.2.2 for NAM 4.2 or 4.1.2 Hot Fix 1 for NAM 4.1.
*   **Workaround:** As a workaround, the risk.jsp can be disabled by removing its servlet and servlet-mapping from the web.xml file located at `/opt/novell/nids/lib/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml` and restarting the IDP server.
