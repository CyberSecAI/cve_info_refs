Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5086:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump uses a custom communication protocol that lacks sufficient protection against capture-replay attacks. This means that transmitted commands can be intercepted and replayed later without detection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Lack of replay attack prevention:** The communication protocol lacks sequence numbers, timestamps, or other mechanisms to prevent replay attacks.
*   **No transmission assurance:** The protocol doesn't guarantee that packets are received in the correct order or at all.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized insulin delivery:** An attacker can capture valid remote commands and replay them later, causing the pump to deliver insulin without the user's authorization.
*   **Hypoglycemic reaction:** This unauthorized insulin delivery can lead to a hypoglycemic reaction in the patient, potentially causing serious health issues.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Remote attack via RF:** An attacker can perform this attack remotely through radio frequency (RF) communication with the pump.
*   **Proximity required:** While the normal communication range between the remote and pump is around 10 meters, this attack can be carried out from distances of one to two kilometers or more, with sufficiently powered radio equipment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to capture RF communications:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept the RF signals transmitted between the remote and the pump.
*   **Technical skill:** The attacker needs a moderate level of technical skill to capture and replay the RF communication.
*   **Proximity:** Although, normal use range is about 10 meters, more sophisticated attacks can be performed from 1 to 2 kilometers and potentially more with better equipment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a set of three vulnerabilities identified in the Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump system.
*   The vendor, Animas, will not release a patch, but has provided mitigations such as turning off RF or limiting bolus amounts.
*   The risk of widespread exploitation is considered low, but individual users are advised to take precautions.
*   The attacker cannot obtain personally identifiable information.
