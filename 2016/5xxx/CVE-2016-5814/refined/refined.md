- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A classic buffer overflow exists in the code that opens and parses RSLogix 500 and RSLogix Micro project files with an RSS extension.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-120) exists when parsing RSS files. The vulnerability occurs because the software does not properly check the size of the input when copying data into a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow malicious code execution on the target computer with the same privilege level as the logged-in user. The impact would depend on the malicious code and existing mitigations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to create a malicious RSS file and convince a user to open it using a vulnerable version of the software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious RSS file and must rely on social engineering to convince a user to open the file. The user must be running the vulnerable software on their local machine.
