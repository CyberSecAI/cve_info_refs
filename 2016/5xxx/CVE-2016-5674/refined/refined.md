Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-5674:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper input validation in the `__debugging_center_utils___.php` file. The `log` parameter from a GET request is not sanitized and is directly passed to the `system()` function in PHP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `system()` function call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected devices.
*   On NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo devices, the code is executed as the `root` user.
*   On ReadyNAS Surveillance devices, the code is executed as the `admin` user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is in the `__debugging_center_utils___.php` file.
*   The `log` parameter is used to construct a command that is then executed via the PHP `system()` function.
*   Example exploits are provided for various device types:
    *   **ReadyNAS Surveillance:** Uses `perl` to create a reverse shell.
    *   **NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo:** Uses `telnet` to create two shells for command execution and output.

**Affected Products/Versions:**

*   NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
*   NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
*   ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
*   Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected.
