Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5690:

**Root Cause:**
- An error in the `for` statement within the "Compute pixel scaling table" part of the `ReadDCMImage` function in the `coders/dcm.c` file.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Loop Condition:** The original loop condition `i < (ssize_t) (GetQuantumRange(depth)+1)` was incorrect. The loop should have iterated up to and including the range, which is achieved by changing the loop condition to  `i <= (ssize_t) GetQuantumRange(depth)`.
- This loop calculates a scaling table, which is later used to scale the pixel values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The incorrect loop could cause a heap buffer overflow because the code will write to a memory location beyond the boundaries of the allocated scale array.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a malformed DCM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file.
- This vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted DCM file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious DCM file to ImageMagick.
- No specific privileges or authentication is required for the attack, other than the ability to provide the input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves changing the loop condition in the `ReadDCMImage` function in `coders/dcm.c`.
- This vulnerability was addressed in ImageMagick versions 7.0.1-7 and 6.9.4-5.
- This vulnerability was identified through fuzzing.
- The provided commit `5511ef530576ed18fd636baa3bb4eda3d667665d` fixes multiple issues within the DCM parser.
