The content is related to CVE-2016-5646.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the calculation of the buffer size for memory allocation, which leads to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability when calculating the size of a buffer to be allocated. The size is determined by multiplying `this->dword214` and `this->_csectMiniFat`.
- Heap overflow due to writing data into a buffer that was allocated with an incorrect (too small) size by using `memcpy` function.
- Lack of proper size validation of user-controlled data used in calculations for memory allocation.
- The value of `_uSectorShift` from the input file is used as a shift amount which can lead to a large value for allocation size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution due to heap corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted CBFF file that triggers the integer overflow in the buffer size calculation, leading to heap corruption.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed CBFF file to the vulnerable software (Lexmark Perceptive Document Filters library).
