Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-5701:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way phpMyAdmin handles URIs when not accessed over HTTPS. Specifically, the `setup/frames/index.inc.php` file is vulnerable to BBCode injection. The code constructs a link to redirect the user to HTTPS, if available, but it doesn't properly sanitize the URI parameters, making it susceptible to injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- BBCode Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of the URI. An attacker can inject BBCode tags into the generated link.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The injected BBCode could be used to alter the display of the page.
- More severely, injected code could redirect users to a malicious site or perform other actions within their session. This allows for session hijacking, phishing, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted URI: An attacker crafts a malicious URI with embedded BBCode that is sent to the user
- HTTP Session: The vulnerability is only applicable to sessions using the insecure HTTP protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and deliver it to the victim.
- The target user has to be using phpMyAdmin over plain HTTP for this vulnerability to be effective.
