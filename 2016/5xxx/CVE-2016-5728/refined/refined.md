  "CVE-2016-5728": {
    "description": "Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The MIC VOP driver performs two successive reads from user space to read a variable-length data structure. If the data structure changes between the two reads, kernel memory corruption can occur.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Race condition",
        "Double-fetch vulnerability",
        "Potential memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially leak sensitive kernel memory.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system is required",
         "A malicious application can modify the data structure in user space between the two kernel reads."
      ],
	 "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to execute code on the local system",
		"Ability to interact with the MIC VOP driver"
      ]
