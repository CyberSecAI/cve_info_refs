  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2016-5725",
    "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in JSch that allows a malicious sftp server to force a client-side relative path traversal in jsch's implementation for recursive sftp-get. An attacker could leverage this to write files outside the client's download basedir with effective permissions of the jsch sftp client process.",
    "root_cause": "The jsch sftp client does not properly sanitize the paths received from the sftp server during a recursive get operation. It concatenates the client's destination folder with the server provided filename after stripping any data before and including `/` of the filename. If the server provides a file name with path traversal sequences like `/..\\..\\totally_malicious_script`, the client builds a destination path outside the intended base directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can write files outside the client's download base directory with the permissions of the jsch sftp client process. This could lead to arbitrary file creation and potential code execution if the attacker can place executable files in locations where they will be executed by the user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack is triggered by a malicious sftp server during a recursive `sftp-get` operation.",
      "The sftp server provides a crafted filename with path traversal sequences in response to a directory listing request."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a malicious sftp server and have a user with a vulnerable version of `jsch` connect to it. The attacker also needs to have the target use recursive `sftp-get`. Post-authentication is required."
