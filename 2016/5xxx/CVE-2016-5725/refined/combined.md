RHSA-2017:3115 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-11-02
Updated:
2017-11-02
# RHSA-2017:3115 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R5 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that ResourceServlet in Spring Framework does not sanitize the paths that have been provided properly. An attacker can utilize this flaw to conduct directory traversal attacks. (CVE-2016-9878)
* A vulnerability was discovered in Apache Thrift client libraries that allows remote, authenticated attackers to cause an infinite recursion via vectors involving the skip function, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. (CVE-2015-3254)
* A vulnerability was discovered in JSch that allows a malicious sftp server to force a client-side relative path traversal in jsch's implementation for recursive sftp-get. An attacker could leverage this to write files outside the client's download basedir with effective permissions of the jsch sftp client process. (CVE-2016-5725)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

Installation instructions are located in the download section of the customer portal.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

## Description

quote website [1]

> JSch is a pure Java implementation of SSH2. JSch allows you to connect to an sshd server and use port forwarding, X11 forwarding, file transfer, etc., and you can integrate its functionality into your own Java programs. JSch is licensed under BSD style license.

```
We have recognized that the following applications have used JSch.

	* Ant(1.6 or later).
	  JSch has been used for Ant's sshexec and scp tasks.
	* Eclipse(3.0).
	  Our Eclipse-CVSSSH2 plug-in has been included in Eclipse SDK 3.0. This plug-in will allow you to get ssh2 accesses to remote CVS repository by JSch.
	* NetBeans 5.0(and later)
	* Jakarta Commons VFS
	* Maven Wagon
	* Rational Application Devloper for WebSphere Software
	* HP Storage Essentials
	* JIRA
	* Trac WikiOutputStreamPlugin

```

## Summary

A malicious sftp server may force a client-side relative path traversal in jsch's
implementation for recursive sftp-get allowing the server to write files outside
the clients download basedir with effective permissions of the jsch sftp client
process.

* affects recursive get, i.e. sftp :/\* .
* post-auth
* file overwrite capability depends on the client specified mode: `ChannelSftp.get(...,mode==ChannelSftp.OVERWRITE)`
* windows only

see attached PoC

## Details

```
* examples/Sftp.java::main::
	c.get(p1, p2, monitor, mode);
 * ChannelSftp.java::get(String src, String dst, SftpProgressMonitor monitor, int mode)
  * ChannelSftp.java::_get(src,dst,monitor,mode,skip)

```

## Proof of Concept

Prerequisites:

* install python 2.7.x
* issue `#> pip install paramiko` to install `paramiko` ssh library for python 2.x
* run `poc.py --help`

```
	Usage: sftpserver [options]
	-k/--keyfile should be specified

	Options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --host=HOST           listen on HOST [default: localhost]
	  -p PORT, --port=PORT  listen on PORT [default: 3373]
	  -l LEVEL, --level=LEVEL
	                        Debug level: WARNING, INFO, DEBUG [default: INFO]
	  -k FILE, --keyfile=FILE
	                        Path to private key, for example /tmp/test_rsa.key

```

poc:

1. run `poc.py` to spawn the ssh/sftp stub listening for new connections on `0.0.0.0:3373`:

   ```
   poc.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3373 -l DEBUG -k test_rsa.key

   INFO:__main__:[cve-2016-5725] sftp server starting...
   INFO:__main__:* generating fake files
   INFO:__main__:** /..\..\totally_malicious_script

   INFO:__main__:* monkey patching: symlink
   INFO:__main__:* starting sftp server...
   0.0.0.0 3373

   ```
2. connect to `poc.py` using jsch sftp-client example `examples/Sftp.java` (any user, user password):

   ```
   sftp>

   ```
3. issue a recursive get (any remote folder will do for the PoC) to store all files from `remote:fancyfolder` to `.`.

   Note: output may contain additional debug information not enabled by default in `examples/Sftp.java`

   Note: pwd is `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch`

   Note: local output folder is `.` (`<path>\workspace-ee\jsch`)

   ```
   sftp> get fancyfolder/* .
   ```
4. client connects to `poc.py` with subsystem sftp

   ```

   DEBUG:paramiko.transport:Starting handler for subsystem sftp
   ```
5. jsch sftp-client command `get fancyfolder/* .` calls `opendir(/fancyfolder)` on the PoC sftp server which responds with a fake filelist for `fancyfolder` listing the file `/..\..\totally_malicious_script`.

   ```
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Started sftp server on channel <paramiko.Channel 0 (open) window=2097152 -> <paramiko.Transport at 0x350afd0L (cipher aes128-ctr, 128 bits) (active; 1 open channel(s))>>

   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: readdir
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: readdir
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: close
   ```
6. jsch sftp-client recursively downloads the files listed in the response to `opendir(/fancyfolder)` (sftp-get, filename includes traversal) by calling `stat`, `open` and `read` on the file.

   a) jsch sftp-client calls `stat` on the filename as returned by the servers response to `opendir` (with traversal): `stat(/fancyfolder//..\\..\\totally_malicious_script)`

   b) the sftp-server (PoC) returns file attributes for `totally_malicious_script` (with traversal)

   c) jsch sftp-client requests file `open` on the path (with traversal): `open(/fancyfolder//..\..\totally_malicious_script)`

   d) jsch sftp-client builds destination path by concatenating the destination folder ( `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.` ) with the server provided filename `/..\..\totally_malicious_script` stripping any data before and including `/` of the filename, then receives the remote files contents: `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.\..\..\totally_malicious_script`

   e) the resulting sftp-client local destination path `dst <path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.\..\..\totally_malicious_script` is outside the basedir `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.`

   sftp-server (PoC)

   ```
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: stat
   INFO:__main__:STAT (u'/fancyfolder//..\\..\\totally_malicious_script')
   INFO:__main__:STAT - returning: totally_malicious_script
   INFO:__main__:** /..\..\totally_malicious_script
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: open
   INFO:__main__:OPEN: /fancyfolder//..\..\totally_malicious_script
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: read
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: read
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: read
   DEBUG:paramiko.transport.sftp:[chan 0] Request: close
   ```

   sftp-client (jsch)

   ```
   dst <path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.\..\..\totally_malicious_script
   _get: /fancyfolder//..\..\totally_malicious_script, java.io.FileOutputStream@7ccf3329
   sftp>
   ```
7. downloaded file is stored in server controlled relative path on client

   ```
   tintin@testbox ~<path>/workspace-ee/jsch
   $ ls ../../total*
   ../../totally_malicious_script
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**Q**: `ImportError: No module named py3compat`

**A**: outdated `paramiko` please upgrade with `pip install --upgrade paramiko`

## Mitigation / Workaround

* normalize and sanitize server provided path and filename, restrict basedir

## Notes

* the PoC is a slightly modified version `stub_sftp.py` shipped with paramiko/tests [4].

Vendor response: see [5]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1375941#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-09-14 09:47:44 UTC  ``` The following flaw was found in jsch:  A malicious sftp server may force a client-side relative path traversal in jsch's implementation for recursive sftp-get allowing the server to write files outside the clients download basedir with effective permissions of the jsch sftp client process.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1375941#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-09-14 09:47:52 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/tintinweb/pub/tree/master/pocs/cve-2016-5725>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1375941#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-02 20:08:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2017:3115 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3115](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3115)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1375941#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2017-12-12 21:41:42 UTC  ``` This was fixed upstream in version 0.1.54, as noted in the upstream release announcement:  <https://sourceforge.net/p/jsch/mailman/message/35318093/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1375941#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2017-12-12 21:44:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1366981](attachment.cgi?id=1366981&action=diff "Upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1366981&action=edit "Upstream fix") Upstream fix  There does not seem to be any public source repository for this project, hence attaching the relevant part of the diff between 0.1.53 and 0.1.54.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1375941#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2017-12-12 22:05:53 UTC  ``` This issue only affected Windows and platforms where backslash character '\' is a valid filesystem path separator.  Prior to the fix, a malicious sftp server could send a file with a name containing a sequence of ..\ which was then appended to the local destination directory name and resulted in the directory traversal on those platforms.  The code prior to the patch attempted to locate the last occurrence of slash '/' in the server-provided name to extract base file name to append to the destination directory name.  Therefore, directory traversal using ../ sequence was not possible.  The applied fix is more generic - it checks whether the constructed destination file name contains '..' and performs path name canonicalization if it does, followed by a check to ensure that the path does not point outside of the intended destination directory.   ``` |  |

Description
---------

quote website [1]

```
> ```
> JSch is a pure Java implementation of SSH2. JSch allows you to connect
>
> ```

```
 to an sshd server and use port forwarding, X11 forwarding, file transfer,
etc., and you can integrate its functionality into your own Java programs.
 JSch is licensed under BSD style license.

We have recognized that the following applications have used JSch.

  * Ant(1.6 or later).
    JSch has been used for Ant's sshexec and scp tasks.
  * Eclipse(3.0).
    Our Eclipse-CVSSSH2 plug-in has been included in Eclipse SDK 3.0.
    This plug-in will allow you to get ssh2 accesses to remote CVS
repository
    by JSch.
  * NetBeans 5.0(and later)
  * Jakarta Commons VFS
  * Maven Wagon
  * Rational Application Devloper for WebSphere Software
  * HP Storage Essentials
  * JIRA
  * Trac WikiOutputStreamPlugin

Summary
-------

A malicious sftp server may force a client-side relative path traversal in
jsch's implementation for recursive sftp-get allowing the server to write
files outside the clients download basedir with effective permissions of the
jsch sftp client process.

* affects recursive get, i.e. sftp <host>:</path>/* .
* post-auth
* file overwrite capability depends on the client specified mode:
  `ChannelSftp.get(...,mode==ChannelSftp.OVERWRITE)`
* windows only

see attached PoC

Details
-------

  * examples/Sftp.java::main::
    c.get(p1, p2, monitor, mode);
   * ChannelSftp.java::get(String src, String dst,
                           SftpProgressMonitor monitor, int mode)
    * ChannelSftp.java::_get(src,dst,monitor,mode,skip)

Source

see ref github.

Proof of Concept
----------------

see ref github.

poc:

1. run `poc.py` to spawn the ssh/sftp stub listening for new connections
   on `0.0.0.0:3373`:

poc.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3373 -l DEBUG -k test_rsa.key

INFO:__main__:[cve-2016-5725] sftp server starting...

INFO:__main__:* monkey patching: stat
INFO:__main__:* monkey patching: symlink
INFO:__main__:* starting sftp server...
0.0.0.0 3373

2. connect to `poc.py` using jsch sftp-client example `examples/Sftp.java`
   (any user, user password):

sftp>

3. issue a recursive get (any remote folder will do for the PoC) to store
   all files from `remote:fancyfolder` to `.`.

Note: output may contain additional debug information not enabled by default
      in `examples/Sftp.java`
Note: pwd is `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch`
Note: local output folder is `.` (`<path>\workspace-ee\jsch`)

sftp> get fancyfolder/* .

3. client connects to `poc.py` with subsystem sftp

4. jsch sftp-client command `get fancyfolder/* .` calls
`opendir(/fancyfolder)`
   on the PoC sftp server which responds with a fake filelist for
`fancyfolder`
   listing the file `/..\..\totally_malicious_script`.

5. jsch sftp-client recursively downloads the files listed in the response
   to `opendir(/fancyfolder)` (sftp-get) by
   calling `stat`, `open` and `read` on the file.

a) jsch sftp-client calls `stat` on the filename as returned by the servers
   response to `opendir` (with traversal):
   `stat(/fancyfolder//..\\..\\totally_malicious_script)`
b) the sftp-server (PoC) returns file attributes for
`totally_malicious_script`
   (with traversal)
c) jsch sftp-client requests file `open` on the path (with traversal):
   `open(/fancyfolder//..\..\totally_malicious_script)`
d) jsch sftp-client builds destination path by concatenating the destination
   folder ( `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.` ) with the server provided filename
   `/..\..\totally_malicious_script` stripping any data before and including
   `/` of the filename, then receives the remote files contents: `
   <path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.\..\..\totally_malicious_script`
e) the resulting sftp-client local destination path
  `dst <path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.\..\..\totally_malicious_script` is outside
   the basedir `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.`

quote website [1]

> JSch is a pure Java implementation of SSH2. JSch allows you to connect
 to an sshd server and use port forwarding, X11 forwarding, file transfer,
etc., and you can integrate its functionality into your own Java programs.
 JSch is licensed under BSD style license.

We have recognized that the following applications have used JSch.

  * Ant(1.6 or later).
    JSch has been used for Ant's sshexec and scp tasks.
  * Eclipse(3.0).
    Our Eclipse-CVSSSH2 plug-in has been included in Eclipse SDK 3.0.
    This plug-in will allow you to get ssh2 accesses to remote CVS
repository
    by JSch.
  * NetBeans 5.0(and later)
  * Jakarta Commons VFS
  * Maven Wagon
  * Rational Application Devloper for WebSphere Software
  * HP Storage Essentials
  * JIRA
  * Trac WikiOutputStreamPlugin

Summary
-------

A malicious sftp server may force a client-side relative path traversal in
jsch's implementation for recursive sftp-get allowing the server to write
files outside the clients download basedir with effective permissions of the
jsch sftp client process.

* affects recursive get, i.e. sftp <host>:</path>/* .
* post-auth
* file overwrite capability depends on the client specified mode:
  `ChannelSftp.get(...,mode==ChannelSftp.OVERWRITE)`
* windows only

see attached PoC

Details
-------

  * examples/Sftp.java::main::
    c.get(p1, p2, monitor, mode);
   * ChannelSftp.java::get(String src, String dst,
                           SftpProgressMonitor monitor, int mode)
    * ChannelSftp.java::_get(src,dst,monitor,mode,skip)

Proof of Concept
----------------

see ref github.

poc:

1. run `poc.py` to spawn the ssh/sftp stub listening for new connections
   on `0.0.0.0:3373`:

poc.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3373 -l DEBUG -k test_rsa.key

2. connect to `poc.py` using jsch sftp-client example `examples/Sftp.java`
   (any user, user password):

sftp>

3. issue a recursive get (any remote folder will do for the PoC) to store
   all files from `remote:fancyfolder` to `.`.

Note: output may contain additional debug information not enabled by default
      in `examples/Sftp.java`
Note: pwd is `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch`
Note: local output folder is `.` (`<path>\workspace-ee\jsch`)

sftp> get fancyfolder/* .

3. client connects to `poc.py` with subsystem sftp

4. jsch sftp-client command `get fancyfolder/* .` calls
`opendir(/fancyfolder)`
   on the PoC sftp server which responds with a fake filelist for
`fancyfolder`
   listing the file `/..\..\totally_malicious_script`.

5. jsch sftp-client recursively downloads the files listed in the response
   to `opendir(/fancyfolder)` (sftp-get) by
   calling `stat`, `open` and `read` on the file.

a) jsch sftp-client calls `stat` on the filename as returned by the servers
   response to `opendir` (with traversal):
   `stat(/fancyfolder//..\\..\\totally_malicious_script)`
b) the sftp-server (PoC) returns file attributes for
`totally_malicious_script`
   (with traversal)
c) jsch sftp-client requests file `open` on the path (with traversal):
   `open(/fancyfolder//..\..\totally_malicious_script)`
d) jsch sftp-client builds destination path by concatenating the destination
   folder ( `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.` ) with the server provided filename
   `/..\..\totally_malicious_script` stripping any data before and including
   `/` of the filename, then receives the remote files contents: `
   <path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.\..\..\totally_malicious_script`
e) the resulting sftp-client local destination path
  `dst <path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.\..\..\totally_malicious_script` is outside
   the basedir `<path>\workspace-ee\jsch\.`

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
