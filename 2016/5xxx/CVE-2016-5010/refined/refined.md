Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5010:

**Root Cause:**
*   An out-of-bounds heap read vulnerability exists in ImageMagick when processing crafted TIFF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick, compiled with TIFF support, processes a maliciously crafted TIFF file using `mogrify`.
*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, indicating the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The primary impact is an out-of-bounds read, which could potentially lead to:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application.
    *   Information disclosure, as the attacker could potentially read sensitive data from memory.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions "a remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition.", however, this is mentioned in the context of multiple ImageMagick vulnerabilities, not specifically CVE-2016-5010.
*   Red Hat rated the issue as having a low security impact and stated it's not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a crafted TIFF file.
*   The vulnerable software processes the crafted file using `mogrify`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIFF file.
*   The targeted system needs to be running ImageMagick with TIFF support enabled.
*   The attacker needs to have a way to trigger `mogrify` on the target system with the crafted TIFF file as input. This could be achieved through various means, including uploading the file or tricking a user into processing it.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick version 6.9.5-3.
*   The upstream patch is available at:  [https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/803bc34ebe023f209f745baf8a112610ff77cc8c](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/803bc34ebe023f209f745baf8a112610ff77cc8c).
*   The vulnerability is present when using `mogrify`.
*   The vulnerability is referenced in Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201611-21.

The provided information gives more detail than the original CVE description by specifying that `mogrify` is the method that triggers the vulnerability.
