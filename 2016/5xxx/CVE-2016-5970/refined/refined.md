Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-5970:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing URL requests. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or block "dot dot" sequences (/../) in URL paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Directory traversal vulnerability. The application allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended web root.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to view arbitrary files on the system, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker can send specially-crafted URL requests containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager Virtual Appliance. The attacker needs to be an authenticated user as the CVSS vector indicates low privileges are needed.
