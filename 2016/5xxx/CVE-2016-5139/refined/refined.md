  "CVE-2016-5139": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflows in the opj_tcd_init_tile function in tcd.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflows in the opj_tcd_init_tile function of the OpenJPEG library, specifically within the tcd.c file.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, by providing crafted JPEG 2000 data.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to get the victim to process the malicious jpeg 2000 data.",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs due to multiple integer overflows when calculating the size of a precinct in the JPEG 2000 image. This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow during memory allocation and processing, potentially causing a crash or allowing for arbitrary code execution. The issue is located in the 'opj_tcd_init_tile' function within tcd.c in the OpenJPEG library, which is used by the PDFium component of Google Chrome."
