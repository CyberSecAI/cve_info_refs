  "CVE-2016-5154": {
    "Description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in PDFium, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted JBig2 image.",
    "Root cause": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the PDFium component, specifically within the `opj_dwt_interleave_v` function in `dwt.c` of the OpenJPEG library.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a denial of service by crashing the browser.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted JPEG 2000 data",
      "Crafted JBig2 image"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a malicious PDF document or a web page containing malformed JPEG 2000 or JBig2 data to trigger the vulnerability.  User interaction (visiting the crafted page/document) is required."
