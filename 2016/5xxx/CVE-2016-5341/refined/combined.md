# Advisory: Crashing Android devices with large Assisted-GPS Data Files [CVE-2016-5348]

## Summary

Android devices can be crashed remotely forcing a halt and then a soft reboot by a MITM attacker manipulating assisted GPS/GNSS data provided by Qualcomm. This issue affects the open source code in AOSP and proprietary code in a Java XTRA downloader provided by Qualcomm.

The Android issue was fixed by in the October 2016 Android bulletin. Additional patches have been issued by Qualcomm to the proprietary client in September of 2016.

This issue may also affect other platforms that use Qualcomm GPS chipsets and consume these files but that has not been tested by us, and requires further research.

## Background – GPS and gpsOneXtra

Most mobile devices today include ability to locate themselves on the Earth’s surface by using the Global Positioning System (GPS), a system originally developed and currently maintained by the US military. Similar systems developed and maintained by other countries exist as well including Russia’s GLONASS, Europe’s Galileo, and China’s Beidou.

The GPS signals include an almanac which lists orbit and status information for each of the satellites in the GPS constellation. This allows the receivers to acquire the satellites quicker since the receiver would not need to search blindly for the location of each satellite. Similar functionality exists for other GNSS systems.

In order to solve the problem of almanac acquisition, Qualcomm developed the gpsOneXtra system in 2007 (also known as IZat XTRA Assistance since 2013). This system provides ability to GPS receivers to download the almanac data over the Internet from Qualcomm-operated servers. The format of these XTRA files is proprietary but seems to contain current satellite location data plus estimated locations for the next 7 days, as well as additional information to improve signal acquisition. Most Qualcomm mobile chipsets and GPS chips include support for this technology. A related Qualcomm technology called IZat adds ability to use WiFi and cellular networks for locations in addition to GPS.

Additional diagram of the system as described [in Qualcomm’s informational booklet](https://web.archive.org/web/20071025232846/http%3A//www.cdmatech.com/download_library/pdf/gpsonextra_assistance.pdf):

## Background – Android and gpsOneXtra Data Files

During our network monitoring of traffic originating from an Android test device, we discovered that the device makes periodic calls to the Qualcomm servers to retrieve gpsOneXtra assistance files. These requests were performed almost every time the device connected to a WiFi network. As discovered by our research and confirmed by [the Android source code](https://android.googlesource.com/device/common/%2B/master/gps/gps.conf_US), the following URLs were used:

> **<http://xtra1.gpsonextra.net/xtra.bin>
>
> <http://xtra2.gpsonextra.net/xtra.bin>
>
> <http://xtra3.gpsonextra.net/xtra.bin>**

> **<http://xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin>
>
> <http://xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin>
>
> <http://xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin>**

WHOIS record show that both domains – **[gpsonextra.net](http://whois.domaintools.com/gpsonextra.net)** and **[izatcloud.net](http://whois.domaintools.com/izatcloud.net)** are owned by Qualcomm. Further inspection of those URLs indicate that both domains are being hosted and served from Amazon’s Cloudfront CDN service (with the exception of **xtra1.gpsonextra.net** which is being served directly by Qualcomm).

On the Android platform, our inspection of the Android source code shows that the file is requested by an OS-level Java process ([GpsXtraDownloader.java](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/ac6d896222051ceeb68dcdd4283f3aee18ec1046/services/core/java/com/android/server/location/GpsXtraDownloader.java)), which passes the data to a C++ JNI class ([com\_android\_server\_location\_GnssLocationProvider.cpp](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/f6527aebbce5e2b6b771fa42ae499c2e7584bd26/services/core/jni/com_android_server_location_GnssLocationProvider.cpp)), which then injects the files into the Qualcomm modem or firmware. We have not inspected other platforms in detail, but suspect that a similar process is used.

Our testing was performed on Android v6.0, patch level of January 2016, on a Motorola Moto G (2nd gen) GSM phone, and confirmed on a Nexus 6P running Android v6.01, with May 2016 security patches.

Qualcomm has additionally performed testing on their proprietary Java XTRA downloader client confirming this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

Android platform downloads XTRA data files automatically when connecting to a new network. This originates from a Java class ([GpsXtraDownloader.java](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/ac6d896222051ceeb68dcdd4283f3aee18ec1046/services/core/java/com/android/server/location/GpsXtraDownloader.java)), which then passes the file to a C++/JNI class ([com\_android\_server\_location\_GnssLocationProvider.cpp](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/f6527aebbce5e2b6b771fa42ae499c2e7584bd26/services/core/jni/com_android_server_location_GnssLocationProvider.cpp)) and then injects it into the Qualcomm modem.

![diagram](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/diagram.jpg?w=700)

**The vulnerability is that both the Java and the C++ code do not check how large the data file actually is. If a file is served that is larger than the memory available on the device, this results in all memory being exhausted and the phone halting and then soft rebooting. The soft reboot was sufficient to recover from the crash and no data was lost. While we have not been able to achieve remote code execution in either the Qualcomm modem or in the Android OS, this code path can potentially be exploited for such attacks and would require more research.**

To attack, an MITM attacker located anywhere on the network between the phone being attacked and Qualcomm’s servers can initiate this attack by intercepting the legitimate requests from the phone, and substituting their own, larger files. Because the default Chrome browser on Android reveals the model and build of the phone ([as we have written about earlier](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2015/09/30/research-chrome-for-android-reveals-phone-model-and-build/)), it would be possible to derive the maximum memory size from that information and deliver the appropriately sized attack file. Possible attackers can be hostile hotspots, hacked routers, or anywhere along the backbone. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the attack file would need to be as large as the memory on the phone.

The vulnerable code resides here – ([GpsXtraDownloader.java](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/ac6d896222051ceeb68dcdd4283f3aee18ec1046/services/core/java/com/android/server/location/GpsXtraDownloader.java), lines 120-127):

> connection.connect();
>
> int statusCode = connection.getResponseCode();
>
> if (statusCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP\_OK) {
>
> if (DEBUG) Log.d(TAG, “HTTP error downloading gps XTRA: “
>
>  + statusCode);
>
> return null;
>
> }
>
> **return Streams.readFully(connection.getInputStream());**

Specifically, the affected code is using **Streams.readFully** to read the entire file into memory without any kind of checks on how big the file actually is.

Additional vulnerable code is also in the C++ layer – ([com\_android\_server\_location\_GnssLocationProvider.cpp](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/f6527aebbce5e2b6b771fa42ae499c2e7584bd26/services/core/jni/com_android_server_location_GnssLocationProvider.cpp), lines 856-858):

> jbyte\* bytes = (jbyte \*)env->GetPrimitiveArrayCritical(data, 0);
>
> sGpsXtraInterface->inject\_xtra\_data((char \*)bytes, length);
>
> env->ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical(data, bytes, JNI\_ABORT);

Once again, no size checking is done.

We were able to consistently crash several different Android phones via a local WiFi network with the following error message:

> ```
> java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Failed to allocate a 478173740 byte allocation with 16777216 free bytes and 252MB until OOM

> ```

***(It should be noted that we were not able to consistently and reliable achieve a crash in the C++/JNI layer or the Qualcomm modem itself)***

## **Steps To Replicate (on Ubuntu 16.04)**

1. Install DNSMASQ:

```
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

```

2. Install NGINX:

```
sudo apt-get install nginx

```

3. Modify the /etc/hosts file to add the following entries to map to the IP of the local computer (varies by vendor of the phone):

```
192.168.1.x xtra1.gpsonextra.net
192.168.1.x xtra2.gpsonextra.net
192.168.1.x xtra3.gpsonextra.net
192.168.1.x xtrapath1.izatcloud.net
192.168.1.x xtrapath2.izatcloud.net
192.168.1.x xtrapath3.izatcloud.net

```

4. Configure /etc/dnsmasq.conf file to listed on the IP:

```
listen-address=192.168.1.x

```

5. Restart DNSMASQ:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart

```

6. Use fallocate to create the bin files in “/var/www/html/”

```
sudo fallocate -s 2.5G xtra.bin
sudo fallocate -s 2.5G xtra2.bin
sudo fallocate -s 2.5G xtra3.bin

```

7. Modify the settings on the Android test phone to static, set DNS to point to “192.168.1.x”. AT THIS POINT – Android will resolve DNS against the local computer, and serve the GPS files from it.

To trigger the GPS download, disable WiFi and enable Wifi, or enable/disable Airplane mode. Once the phone starts downloading the files, the screen will go black and it will reboot.

**PLEASE NOTE:** on some models, the XTRA file is cached and not retrieved on every network connect. For those models, you may need to reboot the phone and/or follow the injection commands [as described here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14548707/android-how-to-reset-and-download-a-gps-data). You can also use an app like [GPS Status and Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2)[GPS Status and Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2).

**The fix would be to check for file sizes in both Java and native C++ code.**

## Mitigation Steps

For the Android platform, users should apply the October 2016 Android security bulletin and any patches provided by Qualcomm. Please note that as per Qualcomm, the patches for this bug only include fixes to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the Qualcomm Java XTRA downloader clients.

**Apple** and **Microsoft** have indicated to us via email that GPS-capable devices manufactured by them including iPad, iPhones, etc. and Microsoft Surface and Windows Phone devices **are not affected** by this bug.

**Blackberry** devices powered by Android are affected but the Blackberry 10 platform is not affected by this bug.

For other platforms, vendors should follow guidance provided by Qualcomm directly via an OEM bulletin.

## Bounty Information

# Android Security Bulletin—December 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published December 05, 2016 | Updated December 21, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of December 05, 2016 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on November 07,
2016 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues are Critical security vulnerabilities in
device-specific code that could enable arbitrary code execution within the
context of the kernel, leading to the possibility of a local permanent device
compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the
device. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common
  questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for additional information:
  + **2016-12-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-12-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-12-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-12-01
    and 2016-12-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the December
  05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2016-12-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2016-12-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2016-12-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2016-12-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-12-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-12-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the December 1, 2016 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of December 5, 2016 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2016-12-01](#2016-12-01-details) and
[2016-12-05](#2016-12-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

# Android Security Bulletin—December 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published December 05, 2016 | Updated December 21, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of December 05, 2016 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on November 07,
2016 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues are Critical security vulnerabilities in
device-specific code that could enable arbitrary code execution within the
context of the kernel, leading to the possibility of a local permanent device
compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the
device. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common
  questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for additional information:
  + **2016-12-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-12-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-12-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-12-01
    and 2016-12-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the December
  05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2016-12-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2016-12-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2016-12-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2016-12-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-12-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-12-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the December 1, 2016 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of December 5, 2016 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2016-12-01](#2016-12-01-details) and
[2016-12-05](#2016-12-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

[google](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/google/)

## Summary

The bootstrap process for Google’s cloud SQL Proxy CLI uses the “curl | bash” pattern and didn’t document a way to verify authenticity of the downloaded binaries. The vendor updated documentation with information on how to use checksums to verify the downloaded binaries.

## Vulnerability Details

[As part of our ongoing research into supply chain attacks](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/07/12/speaking-appsec_village-defcon-29/), we have been analyzing bash installer scripts using the “curl | bash” pattern. [Google provides such script](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy#installation) used to install the Cloud SQL proxy. However, the documentation doesn’t indicate how to verify downloaded files prior to execution.

## Vendor Response

The vendor [updated their documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy/pull/1676/files) with information on how to verify downloaded binaries via checksums.

# [GitBleed – Finding Secrets in Mirrored Git Repositories – CVE-2022-24975](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/11/gitbleed/)

[February 11, 2022July 2, 2024](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/11/gitbleed/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)

## Summary

Due to a discrepancy in Git behavior, partial parts of a source code repository are visible when making copies via the [“git clone”](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command. There are additional parts of the repository that only become visible when using the “–mirror” option. This can lead to secrets being exposed via git repositories when not removed properly, and a false sense of security when repositories are scanned for secrets against a cloned, non-mirrored copy.

Attackers and bug bounty hunters can use this discrepancy in Git behavior to find hidden secrets and other sensitive data in public repositories.

Organizations can mitigate this by analyzing a fuller copy of their repositories using the “–mirror” option and remove sensitive data using tools like [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) (which do a more thorough job).

MITRE assigned [CVE-2022-24975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24975) to track this issue.

***[ADDED APRIL 2022: This bug is NOT the same as [NotGitBleed](https://www.notgitbleed.com/) – see their website here]***

**[ADDED JULY 2024: [A more in-depth article](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/undetected-hard-code-secrets-expose-corporations/) on this issue from AquaSec]**

## Technical Details

Git is a popular open source tool used for version control of source code. When users make a copy of a local or remote git repository, they use the [“git clone”](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command. However, this command doesn’t copy all of the data in the originating repository such as deleted branches and commits. On the other hand, there is a “–mirror” option which copies more parts of the repository. The discrepancy between the two behaviors can lead to secrets and other sensitive data lingering in the original repository. Additionally, existing tools for secrets detection often operate on cloned repositories and do not detect secrets in the mirror portion of the repository unless cloned via the “–mirror” command.

**[ADDED July 2024: More technical details [are available in this blog post from AquaSec](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/undetected-hard-code-secrets-expose-corporations/)]**

We also tested forking in GitHub and GitLab, and in both systems forking uses the regular “git clone” behind the scenes and not the “–mirror” version. That means that repositories containing secrets in the mirrored portion will not propagate those secrets to their forks.

MITRE assigned [CVE-2022-24975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24975) to track this issue.

We provide two examples of repositories containing hidden secrets that are only visible when cloning with the “–mirror” option. These can be found here:

* [gb\_testrepo\_delete](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gb_testrepo_delete) – secret is retained after a branch is deleted
* [gb\_testrepo\_reset](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gb_testrepo_reset) – secret is retained after the git history is reset

If you try to clone the repository without the “–mirror” option, and retrieve the secret, it will not work:

And:

If you try the same with the “–mirror” option, you can now retrieve the secret (also note the larger number of objects retrieved):

If you run [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) on the cloned repositories, no secrets are found:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitleaks_delete_mirror.png?w=314)

However, running [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) on the mirrored copies, finds the secrets stashed in deleted areas:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitleaks_reset_mirror.png?w=437)
## Tooling

There are plenty of existing tools out there that can manipulate git repositories, scan them for secrets and remove specific commits. During our research, we used git for checking out repositories, [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) for figuring out the delta between cloned and mirrored copies of the same repository, and [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) to scan for secrets.

For examples on how to use these tools, please see sample scripts that we have [published to GitHub](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gitbleed_tools).

## Mitigations

Organizations can mitigate this by analyzing a larger part of their repositories using the “–mirror” option and remove sensitive data using tools like [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo). Garbage collection and pruning in git is also recommended.

Organizations should not analyze regular cloned copies (without the “–mirror” option) since that may provide a false sense of security, and should not rely on methods of removing secrets such as deleting a branch or rewinding history via the “[git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)” command.

## Branding

[![logo](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitbleed_icon-3.png?w=383)](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitbleed_icon-3.png)

There seems to be a recent trend to name vulnerabilities. While we think it’s silly, why not go with the flow?

Therefore we named this one “**GitBleed**“, since it leads to bleeding of secrets from repositories – with [a mirrored logo](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gitbleed_tools/blob/main/gitbleed_icon.png) since it involves mirrored repositories.

## Changelog

# [Insecure Bootstrap Process in Oracle Cloud CLI](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/06/insecure-bootstrap-process-in-oracle-cloud-cli/)

[February 6, 2022](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/06/insecure-bootstrap-process-in-oracle-cloud-cli/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)
[oracle](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/oracle/)

## Summary

The bootstrap process for Oracle Cloud CLI using the “curl | bash” pattern was insecure since there was no way to verify authenticity of the downloaded binaries. The vendor is now publishing checksums that can be used to verify the downloaded binaries.

## Vulnerability Details

[As part of our ongoing research into supply chain attacks](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/07/12/speaking-appsec_village-defcon-29/), we have been analyzing bash installer scripts using the “curl | basj” pattern. [Oracle provides such script](https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli#linux) used to install the CLI command for interaction with Oracle Cloud. However, there was no way to check whether the files that the script downloads are legitimate, which could potentially open the end-user to supply chain attacks. The installer is run as follows:

```
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-cli/master/scripts/install/install.sh)"
```
## Vendor Response

The vendor [started publishing SHA-256](https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/releases) checksums for the CLI.

# [Three Reasons Why Log4J Is So Bad: Ubiquity, Severity and Exploitability](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/31/three-reasons-why-log4j-is-so-bad-ubiquity-severity-and-exploitability/)

[December 31, 2021December 30, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/31/three-reasons-why-log4j-is-so-bad-ubiquity-severity-and-exploitability/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Opinion](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/opinion/)
[log4j](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/log4j/)

Over the last few weeks, security teams everywhere have been busy patching [Log4J vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html). In this article we want to talk about the three things you can tell your friends why this is way worse.

## Ubiquity

This vulnerability impacts impacts Java applications and those can be found almost anywhere: enterprise, vendor applications, database drivers, Android phones and even the smartchip on the credit card in your wallet ([Java Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Card)). Additionally, majority of Java applications use log4j to handle logging, often involving user input. While your phone is [probably not exploitable](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-vulnerability.html), the sheer number of places where log4j can be hiding makes this is hard to fix.

## Severity

There are vulnerabilities that come out all the time, but few of them reach the highest possible level of severity: remote code execution (RCE) and this one hits that ticket. That means that every server running Java within your company becomes everyone’s computer – an attacker can run anything they want there and then use that as a springboard to tunnel in further.

## Exploitability

There are many severe vulnerabilities out there that require specialized knowledge to exploit including speaking dead computer languages and building weird binaries during a full moon. With this one, you can begin the exploit [by copy/pasting a tweet into a search bar combined with DNS](https://scotthelme.co.uk/responding-to-the-log4j-2-vulnerability/).

# [WhatsApp for Android Retains Deleted Contacts Locally](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/30/whatsapp-for-android-retains-deleted-contacts-locally/)

[December 30, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/30/whatsapp-for-android-retains-deleted-contacts-locally/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/), [Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)
[facebook](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/facebook/), [whatsapp](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/whatsapp/)

## Summary

WhatApp for Android retains contact info locally after contacts get deleted. This would allow an attacker with physical access to the device to check if the WhatsApp user had interactions with specific contacts, even though they have been deleted.

## Vulnerability Details

When a contact is deleted on WhatsApp, their information about security code changes is retained (while the chat content is not). The only way to get rid of that is to select “Clear Chat” for the contact before deleting it. Even deleting the chat itself doesn’t do it unless the “Clear Chat” operation is done first. [The “security code change notifications” option](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/security-code-change-notification/?lang=en) must be enabled in order for this to work.

Someone getting access to the user’s device can figure out whether they ever chatted with specific contacts, even if those contacts and their chats are no longer on the device. This is a privacy issue – especially for people like journalists and those living in dangerous countries.

Since WhatsApp uses Android’s contact app for contact information but supports chats with numbers that aren’t contacts, our theory is that the application retains information about security code changes even for contacts no longer on the device. There seems to be a discrepancy between how the “Clear chat” option and “Delete Chat” options are implemented in the application, with the first option deleting security notification data.

To reproduce:

1. Delete a chat with a contact that had security code changes before.
2. Delete the contact from the device via the Android Contacts app.
3. Re-add contact to the device via the Android Contacts app.
4. Start a new chat in WhatsApp with that contact but do not send any messages.
5. Observe that security code changes are listed with dates in the chat.
6. Select “Clear Chat” to remove the security code changes, and repeat sterps 1-4. Observe that the security code changes no longer appear.

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen-shot-2021-12-30-at-4.13.16-pm.png?w=612)

Tested on WhatsApp for Android, app version 2.21.20.20, running on Android 12.

## Vendor Response

We haven’t retested on a more recent version but our recommendation to users is to use the “Clear Chat” option in order to prevent this.

The vendor will not be fixing this issue, here is their response:

> *As part of the attack scenario you describe getting access to a person’s WhatsApp account to obtain private data, as you mention yourself, people do have a way to remove these messages from their account, if a bad actor gets access to their WhatsApp account prior to that person deleting that information then they will be able to view this information. As such, we are closing this report.*

# [Open Redirect Vulnerability in Substack](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/08/22/open-redirect-vulnerability-in-substack/)

[August 22, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/08/22/open-redirect-vulnerability-in-substack/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)
[substack](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/substack/)

## Summary

Substack had a open redirect vulnerability in their login flow which would have allowed an attacker to facilitate phishing attacks. The vendor has deployed a fix for this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

Substack is an online platform that allows users to create and operate free and paid subscription newsletters. This platform had an open redirect vulnerability in its login flow which would redirect users to any sites after login completed. This could have been used by an attacker to facilitate phishing attacks targeting Substack users and steal their credentials.

The vulnerability was due to the fact that the “redirect parameter” in the login flow wasn’t been validated to make sure that the redirect only goes to a specific set of URLs. The attacker could specify their own redirect URL as follows:

```
https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=https://www.google.com
```

See screenshots below:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/screen2.png?w=525)
## Vendor Response

Once a correct reporting channel was established, the issue was reported to the vendor and a fix was deployed limited the redirect parameter to Substack-specific URLs.

# [Firebase CLI Installer Making Calls to Google Analytics](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/25/firebase-cli-installer-making-calls-to-google-analytics/)

[May 25, 2021May 25, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/25/firebase-cli-installer-making-calls-to-google-analytics/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)
[analytics](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/analytics/), [firebase](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/firebase/), [google](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/google/)

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a mobile and web application development platform provided by Google. One of the tools available for the platform is the [Firebase CLI tool](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools)) which helps developers interact with the platform from command line. [An automatic install script](https://firebase.tools) is offered among other options, which allows installation of the CLI tool via the “curl | bash” pattern as follows:

```
curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
```

[As part of our ongoing research](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/dont_curl_and_bash) into supply chain attacks, we have been looking into bash installer scripts that make calls to external systems. First, there is no way to verify that the installer is legit, However, to our surprise, we also found that this script makes calls to Google Analytics as part of the installation process. There is no sensitive data being collected but Google may still be collecting IP addresses of users installing the CLI. The source code for the installer script can be found here:

<https://firebase.tools/>

While this can be disabled, the documentation to do so is hard to find and is embedded within the installer script itself. We hope that Google will make this documentation more clear in the future. In any case, here is the documentation:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-25-at-8.08.40-am.png?w=630)

The actual code that makes these calls can be found here:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-25-at-8.10.15-am.png?w=625)

And here are all the analytics events triggered within the script:

```

send_analytics_event start
...
send_analytics_event uninstall_npm
...
send_analytics_event uninstall
...
send_analytics_event already_installed
...
send_analytics_event upgrade
...
send_analytics_event "missing_platform_$UNAME"
...
send_analytics_event failure
...
send_analytics_event missing_path
...

# [New Tools for Addressing Supply Chain Attacks](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/09/new-tools-for-addressing-supply-chain-attacks/)

[May 9, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/09/new-tools-for-addressing-supply-chain-attacks/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/), [Tools](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/tools/)
[supplychainattack](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/supplychainattack/)

In the recent [codecov.io security incident](https://about.codecov.io/security-update/), an attacker modified a shell script used by a common software development tool for code coverage. This modification did not take place at the original source code repository where it would have been visible to others, but after the code was packaged and placed on the web server from which it was served.

Prompted by this incident, we are now releasing new tools that provide information and detection of similar attacks against other projects. The scope is limited to attacks that modify the released code and do not touch the original source code. The following tools are now available:

* **[dont\_curl\_and\_bash](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/dont_curl_and_bash)** – a list of projects that are installed directly off the Internet via a “curl | bash” manner along with possible mitigations
* **[icetrust](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/icetrust)** – a tool that can be used to verify a downloaded artifact such as a shell script before it is executed via methods such as checksums and PGP signatures
* **[release\_auditor](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/release_auditor)** – a tool that can be used to check if a GitHub release was modified after initial publication (see [our earlier blog post](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/04/25/supply-chain-attacks-via-github-com-releases/) for additional information)

Additionally, we are also providing two examples of how a continuous monitoring dashboard can be setup to detect such attacks by project maintainers. The following are available (screenshots below):

* [Simple one page dashboard](https://icetrust_dashboard.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/) (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/icetrust_dashboard_example))
* [Uptime / status-page like dashboard](https://icetrust_uptime.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/) (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/icetrust_uptime_example))

# Advisory: Insecure Transmission of Qualcomm Assisted-GPS Data [CVE-2016-5341]

[December 5, 2016December 7, 2016](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2016/12/05/cve-2016-5341/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [gps](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/gps/), [qualcomm](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/qualcomm/)

## Summary

Assisted GPS/GNSS data provided by Qualcomm for compatible receivers is often being served over HTTP without SSL. Additionally many of these files do not provide a digital signature to ensure that data was not tampered in transit. This can allow a network-level attacker to mount a MITM attack and modify the data while in transit. While HTTPS and digitally-signed files are both available, they are newer and not widely used yet.

There are also some attacks that allow the device to be crashed and those have been fixed by both Qualcomm and Google.

## Background – GPS and gpsOneXtra

Most mobile devices today include ability to locate themselves on the Earth’s surface by using the Global Positioning System (GPS), a system originally developed and currently maintained by the US military. Similar systems developed and maintained by other countries exist as well including Russia’s GLONASS, Europe’s Galileo, and China’s Beidou.

The GPS signals include an almanac which lists orbit and status information for each of the satellites in the GPS constellation. This allows the receivers to acquire the satellites quicker since the receiver would not need to search blindly for the location of each satellite. Similar functionality exists for other GNSS systems.

In order to solve the problem of almanac acquisition, Qualcomm developed the gpsOneXtra system in 2007 (also known as IZat XTRA Assistance since 2013). This system provides ability to GPS receivers to download the almanac data over the Internet from Qualcomm-operated servers. The format of these XTRA files is proprietary but seems to contain current satellite location data plus estimated locations for the next 7 days. Most Qualcomm mobile chipsets and GPS chips include support for this technology. A related Qualcomm technology called IZat adds ability to use WiFi and cellular networks for locations in addition to GPS.

Additional diagram of the system as described [in Qualcomm’s informational booklet](https://web.archive.org/web/20071025232846/http%3A//www.cdmatech.com/download_library/pdf/gpsonextra_assistance.pdf):

## Background – gpsOneXtra Data Files

During our network monitoring of traffic originating from an Android test device, we discovered that the device makes periodic calls to the Qualcomm servers to retrieve gpsOneXtra assistance files. These requests were performed every time the device connected to a WiFi network, and originated from an OS-level process. Our examination of network traffic and the Android source code revealed that the network calls did not use SSL or any other encryption or authentication technology, and that the specific files we tested were not digitally signed. Our testing was performed on Android v6.0, patch level of January 2016, on a Motorola Moto G (2nd gen) GSM phone.

As discovered by our research and confirmed by [the Android source code](https://android.googlesource.com/device/common/%2B/master/gps/gps.conf_US), the following URLs were used:

> **<http://xtra1.gpsonextra.net/xtra.bin>**
>
>  **<http://xtra2.gpsonextra.net/xtra.bin>**
>
>  **<http://xtra3.gpsonextra.net/xtra.bin>**

> **<http://xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin>**
>
>  **<http://xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin>**
>
>  **<http://xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin>**

WHOIS record show that both domains – **[gpsonextra.net](http://whois.domaintools.com/gpsonextra.net)** and **[izatcloud.net](http://whois.domaintools.com/izatcloud.net)** are owned by Qualcomm. Further inspection of those URLs indicate that both domains are being hosted and served from Amazon’s Cloudfront CDN service (with the exception of **xtra1.gpsonextra.net** which is being served directly by Qualcomm). We observed that the **gpsonextra.net** domain is serving v1 of the XTRA data files, while the **izatcloud.net** domain is serving version 2 of the data files, named XTRA2.

Qualcomm has clarified to us that both sets of servers are actually serving three different types of files:

* **xtra.bin** – XTRA 1.0 files, providing GPS assistance data (protected by a CRC checksum)
* **xtra2.bin** – XTRA 2.0 files, providing GPS and GLO assistance data (protected by a CRC checksum)
* **xtra3grc.bin** – XTRA 3.0 files, providing GPS, GLO, and BDS assistance data (protected by a digital signature). These files have been available since 2014.

On the Android platform, our inspection of the Android source code shows that the file is requested by an OS-level Java process, which passes the data to a C++ JNI class, which then injects the files into the Qualcomm modem or firmware. We have not inspected other platforms in detail, but suspect that a similar process is used.

## Vulnerability Details and Implications

**Issue #1** – Because the XTRA and XTRA2 data files are served over HTTP without SSL, this allows an attacker to mount a MITM attack on the network level and modify the GPS assistance data while in transit. While XTRA2 files do use a CRC checksum, it would be possible to re-calculate it.

**Issue #2** – because both XTRA and XTRA2 files do not use a digital signature, the receivers of this data would have no way to verify that it is in fact correct. While XTRA2 files do use a CRC checksum, it would be possible to re-calculate it.

This issue affects all devices with gpsOneXtra capability unless they are using the XTRA3 files. One implication of this type of attack would result in a denial of service in the receiver by forcing a manual search for  GPS signal, thus delaying a GPS lock. Further research is needed to determine if other types of attacks are possible via this channel.

**Issue #3** – see also [our earlier advisory on CVE-2016-5348](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2016/10/04/advisory-cve-2016-5348-2/) about how large XTRA data files can be used to crash Android devices remotely. This was fixed in the Android code back in October of 2016 and was fixed in the Qualcomm binary code used by Android in December 2016.

## Mitigation Steps

For Android devices, users should apply the October and December 2016 security patches.

For all other devices and based on information provided by Qualcomm, the following mitigation steps are available:

* For receivers that support XTRA and XTRA2 formats, switching to HTTPS is recommended using the following URLS:
  > **https://**xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/xtra.bin
  >
  > **https://**xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/xtra.bin
  >
  > **https://**xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/xtra.bin
  >
  > **https://**ssl.gpsonextra.net/xtra.bin

  > **https://**xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin
  >
  > **https://**xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin
  >
  > **https://**xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/xtra2.bin
  >
  > **https://**ssl.gpsonextra.net/xtra2.bin

* Receivers are encouraged to switch to the use of the new XTRA3 digitally signed format in conjunction with HTTPS. Details on the file format and how the digital signature is verified is available to OEMs directly from Qualcomm. The following URLs are available:
  > **https://**xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/**xtra3grc.bin**
  >
  > **https://**xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/**xtra3grc.bin**
  >
  > **https://**xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/**xtra3grc.bin**
  >
  > **https://**ssl.gpsonextra.net/**xtra3grc.bin**

## Vendor Responses

**Qualcomm** has acknowledged the issue as being known since 2014 and has released guidance for their OEM customers on fixing the issue. The fix includes the use of SSL servers to retrieve the XTRA and XTRA2 data files, and the eventual switchover to the new XTRA3 data format which includes a digital signature as described above.

**Google** has acknowledged that this issue affects the Android OS. A fix for this issue is included in the December 2016 Android bulletin.

**Apple** and **Microsoft** have indicated to us via email that GPS-capable devices manufactured by them including iPad, iPhones, etc. and Microsoft Surface and Windows Phone devices **are not affected**, since they use an internal secure delivery mechanism for this data, and do not retrieve data directly from Qualcomm’s servers.
