  "CVE-2016-5341": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure transmission of Qualcomm's Assisted GPS/GNSS data. The data, which is used by GPS receivers to obtain satellite information, is often transmitted over HTTP without SSL. This lack of encryption allows a network attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, modifying the data while in transit. Additionally, many of the transmitted files lack a digital signature that could verify their integrity. While HTTPS and digitally signed files are available, these newer options are not widely used.",
    "details": [
      "**Root cause of vulnerability:** The lack of encryption (HTTPS) and digital signatures on Assisted GPS/GNSS data files served by Qualcomm servers.",
      "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure transmission of data over HTTP, absence of data integrity verification through digital signatures, and potential manipulation of data in transit.",
      "**Impact of exploitation:** A network-level attacker can perform a MITM attack and modify the GPS data while in transit, causing a denial of service by delaying GPS lock. Other types of attacks might be possible through this channel but were not detailed.",
      "**Attack vectors:** A network-level attacker positioned between the device and the Qualcomm servers can intercept the unencrypted HTTP traffic and inject modified data.",
      "**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MITM attack on the network, and to modify the data in transit."
