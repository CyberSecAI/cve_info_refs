# Security Advisories for Firefox ESR

### Impact key

* Critical
  Vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install
  software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing.
* High
  Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data
  from sites in other windows or inject data or code into
  those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.
* Moderate
  Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or Critical
  except they only work in uncommon non-default configurations or
  require the user to perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.
* Low
  Minor security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service
  attacks, minor data leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of
  SSL indicia would have "High" impact because those are generally
  used to steal sensitive data intended for other sites.)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Attached file
[testcase](attachment.cgi?id=8785481)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8785481&action=edit)

See the last paragraph of [bug 1287316 comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=1287316#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - global-buffer-overflow in mozilla::gfx::FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions") - updateFilterOnWriteOnly is only checked on the first draw after the filter was set. If the canvas's IsWriteOnly state changes after that first draw, we don't update the filter, and happily apply feDisplacementMap filters.
This is bad because feDisplacementMap filter rendering can take different amounts of time depending on the input pixel, and the input pixel can be a cross-origin image drawn through drawImage.
In the testcase, the stuff in the top left corner should be a black square, not a black funny looking blob.
Chrome also has this bug.

Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The code hasn't changed since 49, so trivial.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely - canvas filters are a new feature that will be released with 49.

As of the patch on this bug, CanvasRenderContext2D::NeedToCalculateBounds, called before most of the canvas operations (Fill\*, Stroke\*, DrawImage, etc.), can end up calling UpdateFilter, which can invalidate the draw target. ::DrawImage on its own is enough to make it a top crasher on beta.
NeedToCalculateBounds checks NeedToDrawShadow (no side effects) and NeedToApplyFilter (side effects as of this bug.)
NeedToApplyFilter is called in a few other places, and it appears that in at least some of them, the draw target disappearing would be an unexpected (and bad) thing.
So, the question is - is the right solution to not have NeedToApplyFilter call UpdateFilter, or is the right thing to call EnsureTarget after/as a part of NeedToApplyFilter? Or something completely different?
Markus, thoughts? We really shouldn't ship this in 51, if we can at all help it.Flags: needinfo?(mstange)

Another potential issue; NeedToCalculateBounds() only calls NeedToApplyFilter() (with its side effects of updating filters) if NeedToDrawShadow() returns false. Does that mean that we still have the original bug when there is a shadow involved?
(Randomly and unreproducibly, I had this crash when I was testing with a slight modification of the above testcase - <https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/1fafea4d-132e-4d36-bf1e-945052161230>, though I can't quite recall what the modification was :)

AdjustedTargetForFilter calls MaxSourceNeededBoundsForFilter which calls NeedToApplyFilter, even when NeedToCalculateBounds doesn't.

(In reply to Milan Sreckovic [:milan] from [comment #21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1298552#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - Canvas filters allow feDisplacementMaps to be applied to cross-origin images, allowing timing attacks on them"))
> So, the question is - is the right solution to not have NeedToApplyFilter
> call UpdateFilter
I don't think so. If we know that the cached filter is out of date, we need to update it at some point before drawing. We could conceivably do that in each drawing function before we call EnsureTarget, but NeedToApplyFilter feels like a better location to trigger the update.
> or is the right thing to call EnsureTarget after/as a
> part of NeedToApplyFilter?
I think that's a fine solution.
> Or something completely different?
Maybe UpdateFilter should not have the presshell flush in the general case. The flush is needed so that url(#filter) references to SVG filters work, but I think this flush only has to be done when the filter is changed through JS setting the ctx.filter property. If the filter is invalidated by something else, we might not need the flush. So we could potentially move the flush to SetFilter. I don't know if that would help, I'd need to look at it more closely.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Ehsan Akhgari, Jon Coppeard, Gary Kwong, Tooru Fujisawa, Philipp, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 49 and Firefox ESR 45.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2016-5290: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 45.5](#CVE-2016-5290)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Ehsan Akhgari, Jon Coppeard, Gary Kwong, Tooru Fujisawa, Philipp, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 45.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Package        : icedove
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-5290 CVE-2016-5291 CVE-2016-5296 CVE-2016-5297
                 CVE-2016-9066 CVE-2016-9074 CVE-2016-9079

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors,
same-origin policy bypass issues, integer overflows, buffer overflows
and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or
denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.5.1-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.5.1-1 or earlier.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.82 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Firefox Version: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
1. Download the poc.zip file
2. Put the p.url file into the Path 'C:/'
3. Open the spoof.html, click the 'sumbit' button, wait and reproduce this issue.
spoof.html:
<form action="file://127.0.0.1/c:/p.url" target="xx" method="post" onsubmit="setTimeout(k, 2020)" id="c">
<input type="submit">a</input>
</form>
<script>
function k(){
window.open("ja vascript:document.writeln('Spoof Google.com<img src=# onerror=alert(location.href)>!!')","xx");
}
</script>
You could find more details by watching PoC.mp4 and watch PoC.png
Actual results:
The attacker could spoof and inject javascript code into any web pages. In the PoC, you could find the google.com is spoofed and the same-origin police has been bypassed.
Expected results:
Never change the address bar and navigation utill the page has been full loaded.

If you have to convince a user to download a file to a specific path that the website then needs knowledge of to get to a spoof, that feels like it's very hard to exploit. If you can direct the user to download a particular file to a particular location, it feels like that would enable you to do more severe things than spoof the location bar. In other words, I'm not really sure about the severity here.
In fact, does this work if spoof.html is hosted on http? The screenshot shows it on file:///. I would expect it to only work if hosted locally, because the POST to file:/// is presumably not allowed. And if that \*is\* allowed, that feels much more like a docnav issue to me than something to do with the location bar.

As written, I don't believe this helps (and it has other downsides both from a UX and security perspective). AIUI, it is possible for the testcase to work even if google.com loads fully - in fact, if location.href has been updated to reflect google.com, it \*is\* loaded (at least to some degree - waiting for extra images or stylesheets or whatever won't make a difference here).
Instead, the location bar should be updating when the JS runs, though I'd argue that the JS shouldn't be running against the other window at all, because it shouldn't have the same principal as the file-linked-to-google.com document. That's a Core issue, and it wouldn't go away by just not updating the location bar.
Boris, I would expect that we get notified (like through nsIWebProgressListener) when the JS runs here somehow. As noted, I also think the JS shouldn't be running at all, and the fact that it does is a Core issue that needs to be addressed. Am I missing something?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Also pulling in Christoph because of the ... interesting... similarities with [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss"). Which is fixed for 48. Not sure why it's not helping here.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

There is nothing preventing POST to a file:/// URL that I know of. It just gets turned into a GET, with the postdata dropped on the floor.
This does in fact look like [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") to me. And at least on Mac if I try the attached testcase (replacing the .url file with an equivalent .desktop file) I don't see the JS running or the spoof working.
I assume the problem \_is\_ reproducible on Windows? If so, I'd really appreciate it if someone who has easy access to a Windows debug build could check what things look like in nsJSProtocolHandler.cpp, in the nsJSThunk::EvaluateScript, around the principal->Subsumes(objectPrincipal) call. What are principal and objectPrincipal in this case?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Wait. The patch for [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") is using "^" and not "&~" to remove the security-inheritance bit? Which means it might be \_adding\_ it in this case in some situations? That could explain what's going on, if so... :(
Gijs, if you change
nsSecurityFlags secFlags = mLoadInfo->GetSecurityFlags() ^
nsILoadInfo::SEC\_FORCE\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL;
to:
nsSecurityFlags secFlags = mLoadInfo->GetSecurityFlags() &
~nsILoadInfo::SEC\_FORCE\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL;
in nsBaseChannel::Redirect, does that fix the problem?

With this change, AFAICT the JS no longer runs. It's hard to be 100% sure because of the timeout, which means the testcase feels like it'll be a bit racy, but actually it's 100% reproducible for me on beta, and 0% reproducible after this change, when testing on self-compiled nightly. So I suspect you're right. Please needinfo if it'd be helpful for me to poke at this more (e.g. stacks for how we're hitting this case for this exploit) and I'll try and answer any questions tomorrow if that's helpful.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

OK, I thought about it more, and I can reproduce this bug on Mac too. All I have to do is make sure that p.desktop is in the \_parent\_ of the directory that houses spoof.html, so that normally the load of p.desktop would \_not\_ inherit the principal.

We should take this on all branches, including 48 and 45esr. Because once someone looks at the advisory for [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") this would be the obvious thing to try. :(Group: firefox-core-security → core-security

Be more careful about removing the inherit principal bit on base channel redirects
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Good question. Probably pretty easily if you know how this codepath is hit and how our file security model works.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not as far as I could avoid. I did explicitly talk about removing the bit, but I assume anyone who sees fooo & ~bar will know that anyway.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
45esr, 48, 49, 50, 51.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should be a trivial backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This seems pretty safe to me. Minimal testing is probably OK.

Daniel, note that this bug basically allows file:// stuff to violate our security model for file://. Place a .url/.desktop file in a dir pointing to an arbitrary file, have a file in a \_child\_ of that dir that links to that .url/.desktop, load that file from the child dir, and suddenly you are same-origin with the arbitrary file the .url/.desktop links to.
So it may be worth taking this in a security update to 48, unless there simply isn't time for one before 49 ships anyway.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

There isn't time for this before 49 ships. We've had our last beta.
As a sec-moderate (unless this is mis-rated), it doesn't need sec-approval+ to land on trunk.

Generally sec-high or sec-critical unless a special case is made. We don't take moderate or low rated issues on the ESR branch normally for stability reasons.

Dan is the one who rated it sec-moderate so you would need to ask him why it isn't a high if you think it is misrated. Otherwise, policy is that we don't take moderate or low bugs on ESR.

This was already marked "49+", because on security grounds it does. "sec-moderate" doesn't mean "we never take it on ESR", it means we judge it case-by-case. The download requirement lessens the mass-pwnage possibilities (thus not "high"), but the impact to affected individuals can still be severe.
Looks like it's too late for 49 (RC already shipped, this isn't a re-spin type fix) so I'll move the ESR to match "50+", but we do still want it on ESR just as we took [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") on ESR.

Yes, we have to draw a line somewhere for ESR. As Al said, sec-high and sec-moderate.
If you think that the risk is high enough to take it into ESR, we should probably bump the severity.Flags: needinfo?(sledru)

Well, I can't tell, because our severity ratings are all web-site-centric and don't really address the threat vector being a local file.
In this case, the attack would involve placing a specially crafted .desktop/.url file on the users disk, so maybe it's not that dangerous. I just can't tell. Do we consider a file on a network drive reading arbitrary files off your hard disk a sec-moderate or a sec-high?

We do take exceptions to this policy. The dev or someone else just makes a case for it normally. I didn't realize Dan had wanted it. Bumping the severity isn't really a solution as it messes up our rating system, which is not "make this more severe so we'll take it on ESR." The ratings have specific meanings (as much as possible).

Additionally, as Dan said in [comment #30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1292159#c30 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox V48.0 UXSS & Address Bar Spoofing"), we took [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") on ESR, which was also sec-moderate rated and involved a similar-ish problem. This bug is a direct regression from that bug, and so arguably as a regression that we uplifted to ESR, the fix for that regression should be uplifted as well, particularly because it is a security issue that, as noted in [comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1292159#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox V48.0 UXSS & Address Bar Spoofing"), is reasonably "obvious" given both the commit here and the previous fix which was already CVE'd and made public as fixed in earlier versions of ESR.

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Dan Minor, Tyson Smith, Jon Coppeard, Jan-Ivar Bruaroey, Jesse Ruderman, and Markus Stange reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 49. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8787005&action=edit)

While loading external script data, the following code is executed in nsScriptLoadHandler (nsScriptLoader.cpp):
nsresult
nsScriptLoadHandler::TryDecodeRawData(const uint8\_t\* aData,
uint32\_t aDataLength,
bool aEndOfStream)
{
int32\_t srcLen = aDataLength;
const char\* src = reinterpret\_cast<const char \*>(aData);
int32\_t dstLen;
nsresult rv =
mDecoder->GetMaxLength(src, srcLen, &dstLen);
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
uint32\_t haveRead = mBuffer.length();
uint32\_t capacity = haveRead + dstLen; // [[ 1 ]]
if (!mBuffer.reserve(capacity)) {
return NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
}
rv = mDecoder->Convert(src,
&srcLen,
mBuffer.begin() + haveRead,
&dstLen);
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
haveRead += dstLen;
MOZ\_ASSERT(haveRead <= capacity, "mDecoder produced more data than expected");
MOZ\_ALWAYS\_TRUE(mBuffer.resizeUninitialized(haveRead));
return NS\_OK;
}
The calculation of the new capacity at [[ 1 ]] can overflow if enough data is sent by the server (>4GB). In that case, the following call to mBuffer.reserve() won't change the size of mBuffer. Afterwards, mDecoder->Convert() will write data past the end of the 8GB buffer (mBuffer stores char16\_t) [1].
poc.py (requires python 3.5) in the attached archive will trigger this condition and cause an access violation while writing data into an unmapped region following the buffer (tested on Firefox 48.0.1 and Aurora):

Some notes regarding exploitability:
- It is possible to use compression to reduce the network load. The attached PoC code does that and thus only needs to send about 18MB of data.
- It should be possible to place some objects behind the buffer, as mmap will usually allocate adjacent memory regions. This could be done as follows:
- The server sends the first 0xffffffff bytes of the payload, causing an allocation of an 8GB memory region
- JavaScript code executes and allocates lots of target objects. At some point new memory is requested via mmap, which should be placed behind the 8GB buffer
- The server sends the remaining data, overflowing into the previously allocated objects
- Due to page deduplication and/or compression beeing performed by the kernel, it should be possible to trigger the bug while having less than 8GB of available RAM. At least on my Mac this seems to be the case as memory usage stays relatively low even during the allocations.
- A 64-bit build of Firefox is required so the bug can be triggered.
- The data that is being written is not 100% controlled as it must be valid UTF-16
[1] There is a special case when the capacity wraps around to zero. In that case the process will (likely) not crash as the overflow only happens inside the 8GB chunk.

[Another Proof-of-Concept](attachment.cgi?id=8787399) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8787399&action=edit)

I've created a second PoC that allocates a Uint8Array behind mBuffer, which is then being overflown into. I've tested this on OS X 10.11. It's still a bit hackish since I haven't fully figured out what jemalloc and the OS X kernel are doing during the realloc calls.
If there are no mitigations in place which add guard pages in front of important memory regions (or something similar) it should be possible (at least on OS X) to place something more "interesting" behind mBuffer, which is then overwritten.
Things look a bit different on Linux though. For one, the mmap region on Linux grows towards lower addresses, while it grows towards higher addresses on OS X. I haven't checked Windows. It should still be possible to allocate something in the memory region following the buffer, but the new PoC will likely not work on Linux out of the box.

Attached file
[PoC Exploit](attachment.cgi?id=8792243)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8792243&action=edit)

I've created another PoC. This one spawns (most of the time) Calculator.app on the latest Firefox (48.0.1) for OS X (10.11.6).
The large comment in code.js gives a decent overview over how the exploit works. The very short version is that it forces an allocation of an Arena (filled with ArrayBuffers) behind the buffer that is overflown. It then frees (roughly) one ArrayBuffer in every Arena and triggers GC. Finally it overflows into the |firstFreeSpan| field of the Arena and makes it look like the free slot is inside the inline data of one of the ArrayBuffer objects. When more ArrayBuffer objects are then allocated, one of them will be placed inside the data of another ArrayBuffer, making it accessible from JavaScript. From there, crafting an arbitrary read/write primitive becomes fairly easy.
The PoC currently is version dependent (due to the offsets in code.js) and only works on OS X since it assumes that the mmap region grows upwards.
For a generic mitigation, either randomizing mmap regions or inserting guard pages before/after mmap chunks should work, although I think this type of bug is best mitigated by the kernel...

I didn't managed to reproduce this issue on Mac OS X 10.11.6. I've used both poc.zip and PoC Exploit and tried to run index.html by making a http server with python 3.5. This was done on firefox 48.0.1 in 64 bit as Samuel said in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1299686#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in nsScriptLoadHandler") in order to trigger the bug. If I understand right this needs to crash (this is what I see: <http://imgur.com/a/LXFzA>) or maybe I am doing something wrong here.

You'll have to use the poc.py script (a custom webserver) from the zip archive since some server side logic is required for the code to work. Are you doing that?
