- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OmniView web application has insufficient password requirements, allowing attackers to potentially brute-force account passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak password requirements (CWE-521).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially compromising control over backup generators connected to those accounts. This could lead to unauthorized manipulation or control of the backup generators.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation through the OmniView web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the OmniView web application and the ability to attempt multiple login attempts to brute-force passwords. Low skill level is needed to exploit.
