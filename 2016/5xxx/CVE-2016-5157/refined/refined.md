Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5157:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a heap overflow vulnerability in the `opj_dwt_interleave_v` function within the `dwt.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. This flaw occurs when handling crafted JPEG 2000 data within PDFium.
*   The vulnerability arises from the casting of `OPJ_UINT32` coordinate values to `OPJ_INT32` without proper bounds checking. This could lead to negative coordinate values, leading to out-of-bounds writes

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow because of improper memory allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
*   **Denial of service:** An attacker could trigger a crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting a malicious JPEG 2000 image.
*   **User interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to open or process a malicious PDF file containing the crafted JPEG 2000 image within a vulnerable application (e.g., a web browser).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Crafted data:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image that triggers the integer overflow.
*   **Network access:** The attacker would need to deliver the malicious PDF to a victim.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the PDFium library, which is used in Google Chrome.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Chromium version 53.0.2785.89.
*   The vulnerability also exists in the openjpeg library and affects multiple products/distributions using it.
*   The fix involves adding sanity checks for negative and out-of-bounds values in the `opj_tcd_init_tile` function, specifically when handling coordinate values.
*   Red Hat tracked this issue in bugzilla as [1372218](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1372218)
