- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The internal HTTP proxy server in IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience Replay Server accepts requests from any network host, not just local renderers. This allows an attacker to use the server as a proxy to forward HTTP requests to other internal/external web resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of access control on the internal proxy server, allowing external entities to connect and use it as an open proxy.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use the vulnerable server as an open proxy to forward HTTP requests to other internal/external web resources. This could allow them to access restricted content, bypass security controls, or perform other malicious actions. The impact is rated as "Low" for integrity modification, and no impact on confidentiality or availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server's proxy service. No prior authentication is needed.
