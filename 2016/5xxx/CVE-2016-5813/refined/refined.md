Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5813:

**Vulnerability:** Information Exposure (CWE-200)

* **Root Cause:** When a specific URL to an image is accessed, the downloaded image includes source code used in the web server. This exposes sensitive information about the server-side image generation process.
* **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of image requests, leading to the unintended inclusion of server-side source code within the image response.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gather information on how server-side images are generated. By combining this with additional information (possibly through testing) they can potentially download arbitrary images from the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by accessing a specific URL related to an image resource.
    *   The attack is network-based and requires no user interaction.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
    *   No special privileges are needed and it can be done remotely, thus low skill is required.

**Additional details not in the official CVE description:**
* The affected product is Visonic's PowerLink2 module, used for intrusion security systems.
* The product is used primarily in the United States and Europe.
* The vendor has released a firmware update in October 2016 to address the issue.
* There are also mitigation steps recommended including isolating the devices from the internet, using firewalls, and using VPNs if remote access is required.
