## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1705](/security/CVE-2016-1705))

It was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the

origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms.

([CVE-2016-1706](/security/CVE-2016-1706))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a

deferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass

same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1710](/security/CVE-2016-1710))

It was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a

detach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1711](/security/CVE-2016-1711))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5127](/security/CVE-2016-5127))

It was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors

from modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5128](/security/CVE-2016-5128))

A memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5129](/security/CVE-2016-5129))

A security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL.

([CVE-2016-5130](/security/CVE-2016-5130))

A use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5131](/security/CVE-2016-5131))

The Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement

the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to

control a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5132](/security/CVE-2016-5132))

It was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy

authentication. A machine-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this

to spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. ([CVE-2016-5133](/security/CVE-2016-5133))

It was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium

does not ensure that URL information is restricted to a scheme, host and

port. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2016-5134](/security/CVE-2016-5134))

It was discovered that Blink does not consider referrer-policy information

inside an HTML document during a preload request. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP)

protections. ([CVE-2016-5135](/security/CVE-2016-5135))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in

Blink does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether a specific

HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-5137](/security/CVE-2016-5137))

Since M49, Chrome has been prompting for proxy authentication credentials using the target origin instead of the origin of the proxy server. Even if the proxy origin was displayed correctly, a mischievous network operator could still spoof the proxy server origin. To mitigate these problems, this CL: \* Fixes the origin used in the proxy authentication login prompt to use the origin of the proxy server. \* Indicate if the proxy server connection is insecure. \* Always throw up an interstitial and clear the omnibox when showing a proxy auth prompt. \* Use the correct origin when saving proxy authentication credentials.

vabr: This logic doesn't distinguish between http and https proxies. I.e. a password stored for an https proxy will be automatically provided to a http proxy. In the new logic, we are passing up the origin of the proxy server up to this layer. So we are using the correct origin here when populating dialog_form.origin.  This will cause existing stored password entries for https proxies to become orphaned and users will be prompted again after this change. I think this is OK given that we really don't want to share passwords between secure and insecure proxies. WDYT?

Hence dialog_form.origin = GURL("http://example.com:80") when authenticating against "http://example.com".  After this CL, dialog_form.origin would be GURL("http://example.com"). Since GURL canonicalizes the URL there should be no observable change in behavior before and after this change. ```     | **asanka** | | asanka@chromium.org changed reviewers: + brettw@chromium.org | | --- | | 4 years, 6 months ago (2016-06-14 18:51:26 UTC) [#3](#msg3) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` asanka@chromium.org changed reviewers: + brettw@chromium.org ```     | **asanka** | | Description was changed from ========== Use correct origin when prompting for proxy authentication.

To mitigate these problems, this CL:  * Fixes the origin used in the proxy authentication login prompt to use   the origin of the proxy server.  * Indicate if the proxy server connection is insecure.  * Always throw up an interstitial and clear the omnibox when showing a   proxy auth prompt.  * Use the correct origin when saving proxy authentication credentials.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[629852](https://crbug.com/629852)] CVE-2016-1705: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

# CVE-2016-5135

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5134.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5136.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5135 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5135)

#### Description

WebKit/Source/core/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not consider referrer-policy information inside an HTML document during a preload request, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by a "Content-Security-Policy: referrer origin-when-cross-origin" header that overrides a "<META name='referrer' content='no-referrer'>" element.
