  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "Cloudera Manager transmits certain diagnostic data (or \"bundles\") to Cloudera. These diagnostic bundles are used by the Cloudera support team to reproduce, debug, and address technical issues for customers.\n\nCloudera support discovered that potentially sensitive data may be included in diagnostic bundles and transmitted to Cloudera. This sensitive data cannot be used by Cloudera for any purpose.\n\nCloudera has modified Cloudera Manager so that known sensitive data is redacted from the bundles before transmission to Cloudera. Work is in progress in Cloudera CDH components to remove logging and output of known potentially sensitive properties and configurations.",
    "root_cause": "Potentially sensitive data, such as configurations and properties, was being included in diagnostic bundles transmitted from Cloudera Manager to Cloudera.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inclusion of sensitive data in diagnostic bundles",
      "Lack of proper redaction of sensitive information before transmission."
    ],
    "impact": "Possible logging and transmission of sensitive data.",
    "attack_vector": "Transmission of diagnostic bundles from Cloudera Manager to Cloudera.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned. The vulnerability stems from the design of the diagnostic data collection and transmission process.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is not due to any malicious activity but due to the design of the diagnostic data collection process.\nThe data was not used by Cloudera for any purpose.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Cloudera CDH",
      "Cloudera Enterprise Editions"
