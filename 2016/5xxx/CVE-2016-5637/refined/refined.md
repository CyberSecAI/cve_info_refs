- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper checking of `transquant_bypass_enable_flag` in the `restore_tqb_pixels` function of libbpg.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write. Specifically, a type confusion vulnerability allows writing outside of allocated memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Processing a crafted BPG image file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a vulnerable application to process a malicious image.
