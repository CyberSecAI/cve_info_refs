  "CVE-2016-5153": {
    "Description": "The Web Animations implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, improperly relies on list iteration, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-destruction) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site.",
    "Root cause": "Improper list iteration in the Web Animations implementation within Blink.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-destruction"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted web site"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required to visit the malicious website.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability stems from how the Web Animations API is implemented in Blink, the browser engine used by Chrome. The issue involves improper handling of list iterations during the animation process. By crafting a specific web page, an attacker can trigger this flaw, leading to memory corruption or other unintended consequences. The vulnerability is specifically a 'use-after-destruction' which arises when an object is accessed after its memory has been freed. The issue was addressed in Chrome version 53.0.2785.89 for Windows and OS X and 53.0.2785.92 for Linux."
