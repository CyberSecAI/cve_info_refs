RELATED: CVE-2016-5158

Summary:
The provided documents discuss a heap overflow vulnerability (CVE-2016-5158) present in the openjpeg library, which also affects the PDFium component of the Chromium browser. This flaw is due to unsafe use of the opj_aligned_malloc function, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- An integer overflow occurs during the calculation of memory allocation for code blocks in JPEG2000 images.
- This integer overflow results in a heap buffer overflow due to the unsafe use of the opj_aligned_malloc function in the openjpeg library.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Heap buffer overflow
- Integer overflow
- Unsafe use of opj_aligned_malloc

Impact of exploitation:
- Application crash
- Potentially arbitrary code execution

Attack vectors:
- A specially crafted JPEG2000 image

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to provide a malicious JPEG2000 image that triggers the overflow when parsed by vulnerable software, such as a web browser or PDF viewer.
