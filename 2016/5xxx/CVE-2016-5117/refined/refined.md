Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the OpenNTPD's implementation of HTTPS constraint functionality, specifically within the `httpsdate_init` function in `constraint.c`.  The code was explicitly disabling server name (Common Name/CN) verification during TLS handshake using `tls_config_insecure_noverifyname()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Server Name Verification:**  By disabling CN verification, OpenNTPD did not check if the server certificate presented during the TLS handshake matched the hostname it was connecting to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A network attacker could intercept the HTTPS request for timestamp constraints and redirect it to a malicious server.
- **Forged Timestamps:** The malicious server, presenting a valid certificate (even if the CN didn't match the expected server), could provide forged timestamps to OpenNTPD.
- **Compromised Time Synchronization:** By accepting forged timestamps, OpenNTPD could be tricked into filtering out legitimate NTP responses and syncing with incorrect time, potentially disrupting system time.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker positioned in the network path between the OpenNTPD client and the intended HTTPS time server.
- **MitM:** The attacker would need to intercept the HTTPS traffic and act as a malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the OpenNTPD server and the configured HTTPS timestamp server.
- **Malicious Server:** They must have a server capable of responding to the HTTPS request with a valid TLS certificate (although the CN is not validated by vulnerable OpenNTPD versions) and provide forged timestamps.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in OpenNTPD versions with constraint functionality before the fix (May 21st, 2016).
- OpenBSD 5.9 was specifically mentioned as an affected version.
- The fix involves removing the `tls_config_insecure_noverifyname` call and enabling server name verification using `tls_connect_servername`.
