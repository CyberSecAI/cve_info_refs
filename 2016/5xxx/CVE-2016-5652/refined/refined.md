  "CVE-2016-5652": {
    "description": "An exploitable heap based buffer overflow exists in the handling of TIFF images in LibTIFFâ€™s TIFF2PDF tool. A crafted TIFF document can lead to a heap based buffer overflow resulting in remote code execution. Vulnerability can be triggered via a saved TIFF file delivered by other means.",
    "affected_component": "libtiff's TIFF2PDF tool",
    "root_cause": "Improper calculation of image tile size when handling JPEG compression in tiff2pdf tool. Specifically, the code decrements the buffer size by 2 bytes after reading the JPEG tables, but before the copy, leading to a heap overflow when the copy occurs because of malloc rounding on OS X, which leads to an exact buffer size and no padding.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, denial of service, memory corruption",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted TIFF image file",
         "Delivered via other means"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIFF file and entice a user into processing it."
