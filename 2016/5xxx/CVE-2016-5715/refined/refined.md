- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Puppet Enterprise Web Interface improperly handles redirects during the login process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authentication redirect vulnerability exists where users can be redirected to an attacker-controlled server after logging in.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to credential theft.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious authentication link with a `redirect` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server. The user then logs in via this malicious link, resulting in the user being redirected to the attacker's server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted link to the victim user. The user needs to click on the malicious link and attempt to log in to the application.
