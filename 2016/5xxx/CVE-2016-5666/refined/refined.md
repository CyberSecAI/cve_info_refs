Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-5666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The web management interface of the Crestron Electronics DM-TXRX-100-STR uses client-side JavaScript for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Client-Side Authentication (CWE-603):** Authentication is performed using client-side JavaScript, making it susceptible to bypass.
- The vulnerability is present in the DM-TXRX-100-STR web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authentication without needing valid credentials, gaining access to the web management interface.
- This can lead to complete control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By intercepting server responses and modifying the 'objresp.authenabled' value to '1', an attacker can bypass the client-side authentication mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the device.
- They do not require knowledge of valid credentials.
- They need to be able to manipulate client-side JavaScript.
