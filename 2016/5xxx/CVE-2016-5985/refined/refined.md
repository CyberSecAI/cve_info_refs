- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (IBM Spectrum Protect) AIX client when Journal-Based Backup is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a system crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. The attacker needs to be able to run code on the vulnerable system. Journal-Based Backup needs to be enabled to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local attacker with the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system.
