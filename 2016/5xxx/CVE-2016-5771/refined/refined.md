Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-5771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2016-5771 is an improper interaction between the `spl_array.c` code in PHP's SPL extension and the unserialize implementation and garbage collection mechanisms. This flaw leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when serialized data is crafted in such a way that an object is freed, and then a pointer to this freed memory is later used by the application, leading to unpredictable results.
*   **Improper Interaction with Unserialize and Garbage Collection:** The vulnerability stems from how the `spl_array.c` component interacts with PHP's `unserialize()` function and the garbage collection routine, allowing the attacker to manipulate memory in an unintended way.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service, as the use-after-free can cause an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending specially crafted serialized data to a PHP application.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to submit crafted serialized data:** The attacker needs to be able to send specific serialized data to a vulnerable PHP application, implying they have some access to the application's input mechanism, even if that is indirect.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **No user interaction required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects PHP versions before 5.5.37 and 5.6.x before 5.6.23.
*   SUSE and Red Hat both acknowledge and provide fixes for this vulnerability, assigning it a "moderate" severity rating. However, they provide a higher CVSS score than what they have assigned themselves.
*   The fix involves patching the `spl_array.c` file.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked in the PHP bug tracker as bug #72433.
*   The provided information includes links to the upstream fix and commits in php-src repository.
*   The Suse advisory mentions that the vulnerability is present in php5 (5.3.x, 5.5.x, 5.6.x) but also in some php7 version (7.0.x, 7.2.x) but not in 7.4.x and later.
*   Red Hat's security advisory mentions that this vulnerability was also fixed along with other vulnerabilities in `rh-php56`, suggesting that a similar vulnerability may exist in their version of php5.
