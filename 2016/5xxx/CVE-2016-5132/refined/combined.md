Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/07/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, July 20, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 52 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 52.0.2743.82 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/51.0.2704.106..52.0.2743.82?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 52.
#### Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [48 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M52). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[629852](https://crbug.com/629852)] CVE-2016-1705: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

# CVE-2016-5135

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5134.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5136.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5135 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5135)

#### Description

WebKit/Source/core/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not consider referrer-policy information inside an HTML document during a preload request, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by a "Content-Security-Policy: referrer origin-when-cross-origin" header that overrides a "<META name='referrer' content='no-referrer'>" element.

I have a strong preference to factor this out into a shared utility function that Document and this both use. It will be much easier to track changes, and even to just track that this check exists at all. This would also probably give you a helpful error message to use, no?  Also, why don't you check if the current origin is potentially trustworthy? That is, you only start checking the child frames. I think this is related to mek's comment.

Yes, remote frames should have correct SecurityOrigins (which we replicate from the corresponding local frame).  We've also recently refactored SecurityOrigin::isPotentiallyTrustworthy and Document::isSecureContext to work correctly with remote frames (see issue 571079).  Ideally you'd just call WebDocument::isSecureContext on the |frame|'s document, so it's too bad that it isn't created yet.  +1 to jww@'s suggestion to unify this walk with the one in Document::isSecureContext if possible. ```     | **falken** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc File content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc#newcode86 content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc:86: while (parent && should\_create\_provider\_for\_window) { On 2016/05/24 18:06:03, jww ... | | --- | | 4 years, 7 months ago (2016-05-25 01:33:34 UTC) [#14](#msg14) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_w...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc) File content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_w...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc#newcode86) content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc:86: while (parent && should_create_provider_for_window) { On 2016/05/24 18:06:03, jww wrote: > On 2016/05/24 17:03:35, Marijn Kruisselbrink wrote: > > On 2016/05/24 at 13:16:37, falken wrote: > > > This ancestor walk should probably be some utility function like > > Document::isSecureContext().

Ideas?  Does Chrome currently check for insecure opener when deciding whether a context is secure? It looks like Document::isSecureContext() doesn't check it.

Each of them has a FrameTreeNodeReplicationState that has some security info, including the origin (and whether it's potentially trustworthy). The only thing missing to do a check that matches the one in RenderFrame is the list of whitelisted urls.

Yeah, you should be able to follow the FrameTreeNode::parent() chain and do the check on FrameTreeNode::current_origin().  You'd need to do some additional work to get isSecureContext's scheme whitelist here, but seems like secureContextBypassingSchemes() ultimately comes from  GetSchemesBypassingSecureContextCheckWhitelist(), which is in chrome/common, so available in the browser process.  So it's actually isn't that bad, but you'd need some extra delegate plumbing to get to it from content/.  What seems harder is that the origin we have on FrameTreeNodes is a url::Origin, which doesn't have all the information from a SecurityOrigin.  We do have a trustworthiness bit in FrameTreeNode::current_replication_state(), has_potentially_trustworthy_unique_origin, but it isn't actually equivalent to SecurityOrigin::isPotentiallyTrustworthy.  It's only meaningful for unique origins (i.e., it indicates potential trustworthiness for a sandboxed iframe), and you'd still need to either do all the other work in SecurityOrigin::isPotentiallyTrustworthy() in the browser process, or replicate the full value of isPotentiallyTrustworthy() from the renderer.  Overall, all this seems non-trivial and I'd vote for doing it in a separate CL.  CC-ing estark@, who's worked on isSecureContext plumbing recently and may have more thoughts on getting it to work from the browser process.

Sorry yes I meant "FrameTreeNode doesn't have the security info". But I think the latest patchset is OK doing the walk renderer-side, for the PlzNavigation case?

I think there's two problems there: 1) isSecureContext allows for scheme exceptions and canHaveSecureChild doesn't. 2) A Document can be frameless (apparently. the comments for WebDocument::frame say so). So document.isSecureContext() can't be transformed to document.frame()->canHaveSecureChild().  1) could probably be resolved by refactoring to a common method, but 2) looks more difficult.  To be more specific, IIRC, the plugin situation looks like: - Frame   - Document     ...       - plugin container (Element)         - plugin instance  It's calling isSecureContext on the document. So it can be whitelisted by scheme. If we instead call Frame::canHaveSecureChild, the scheme whitelist doesn't happen. And we might not have a frame.  Probably canHaveSecureChild should be renamed to something like canHaveSecureChildFrameIgnoringSchemeExceptions.  Having said all that, the plugin check is just for metrics and isn't a security check.

I'm very wary of adding a separate security check that mimics but is slightly different from isSecureContext. Also, why does canHaveSecureChildFrame ignore scheme exceptions? Namely, this ignores extensions, I think, and we generally do want to treat them as secure. ```     | **jww** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc File content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc#newcode86 content/child/service\_worker/service\_worker\_network\_provider.cc:86: while (parent && should\_create\_provider\_for\_window) { On 2016/05/25 04:09:45, falken ... | | --- | | 4 years, 6 months ago (2016-05-28 01:35:25 UTC) [#27](#msg27) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_w...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc) File content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_w...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/20001/content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc#newcode86) content/child/service_worker/service_worker_network_provider.cc:86: while (parent && should_create_provider_for_window) { On 2016/05/25 04:09:45, falken wrote: > On 2016/05/25 01:33:34, falken wrote: > > On 2016/05/24 18:06:03, jww wrote: > > > On 2016/05/24 17:03:35, Marijn Kruisselbrink wrote: > > > > On 2016/05/24 at 13:16:37, falken wrote: > > > > > This ancestor walk should probably be some utility function like > > > > Document::isSecureContext().

That means the current document url must be taken into account. I’m wary, though, of attempting to do so in SWNetworkProvider before we have a document. One problem is redirects. If a chrome://extension could redirect to an https context (it probably can’t), something could sneak past the check with: 1. An http frame embeds a frame with a scheme exception  2. SWNetworkProvider treats the frame as secure, and sends the IPC to create a SWProviderHost 3. SWControlleeRequestHandler intercepts the request 4. The request redirects to an https resource SWControlleeRequestHandler continues handling the request. It has no idea that it’s no longer secure.  It’s also weird that empirically the datasource URL is often empty when SWNetworkProvider is created. So seems too early to do the complete check ala Document->isSecureContext().  I propose: SWNetworkProvider does the ancestor walk and sends is_parent_frame_secure in the IPC, where it’s stored by SWProviderHost SWControlleeRequestHandler combines that bit and the document url to check whether the context is secure.  The latest patchset is a WIPish patch that does that. It adds a test that extensions work too. WDYT of this approach?  I understand the concerns about adding a separate security check that mimics but is slightly different from isSecureContext. At least for the web layer, I’m happy removing WebDocument::isSecureContext() if that’s OK for the plugin usecase.  I’m also wondering about frame reparenting. Is it possible to go from a secure context to an insecure one, without triggering a reload? I did some investigation and it looks like moving an iframe will trigger a reload (I believe due to <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81590> following <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32848>)  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/120001/third_party/WebKit/Sou...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/120001/third_party/WebKit/Source/web/WebFrame.cpp) File third_party/WebKit/Source/web/WebFrame.cpp (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/120001/third_party/WebKit/Sou...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/120001/third_party/WebKit/Source/web/WebFrame.cpp#newcode276) third_party/WebKit/Source/web/WebFrame.cpp:276: bool WebFrame::canHaveSecureChild(WebString& errorMessage) const On 2016/05/28 01:35:25, jww wrote: > Can you add some unit tests to this, similar to what we have for > SecurityOrigin::isPotentiallyTrustworthy()?

Yes, that plan sounds ok.  Since you're already doing part of the check on the browser process side, I do wonder if it's just easier to also move the ancestor walk there now (and use origins on FrameTreeNodes).  You'd need to replicate isPotentiallyTrustworthy values for FrameTreeNode origins, but that might actually be easier than what you had to add for is_parent_frame_secure.  Or does ServiceWorkerControlleeRequestHandler::PrepareForMainResource run on the IO thread, in which case that's not possible?

On the subject of going from a secure to an insecure comment, at some point it was discussed that maybe setting window.domain could be made mutually exclusive with secure contexts (setting document.domain would make a secure context insecure, and accessing any API that would require a secure context would make setting window.domain impossible). But I don't believe that anybody is actively pursuing that idea. And it would probably also be really hard to actually implement, so probably not worth worrying about. ```     | **falken** | | On 2016/06/01 01:30:10, alexmos wrote: > > falken: That sounds good to me, although I ... | | --- | | 4 years, 6 months ago (2016-06-01 03:20:11 UTC) [#36](#msg36) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/06/01 01:30:10, alexmos wrote: > > falken: That sounds good to me, although I think alexmos@ really needs to give > > confirmation. >  > Yes, that plan sounds ok.

We're planning to make some of this information available on the IO thread (via FrameIOData, see some related discussion at [https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/site-isolation-dev/L1nkukFURro...](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/site-isolation-dev/L1nkukFURro/VkpjyJk-BgAJ)), and I hope this will allow us to clean this up and move that check entirely to the browser process.

I like that and ended up adopting your patch, thanks. I think we must use OriginCanAccessServiceWorkers, which is slightly different from IsOriginSecure (SW is HTTP/HTTPS only and has its own set of exceptions, but in practice that is just chrome://extensions).  I think the SWProviderHost function needs to be called something like IsSecureEnoughForServiceWorkers.

Ah, this was needed in the earlier patch that used kInvalidServiceWorkerProviderId instead of passing is_parent_frame_secure. That patch caused site isolation bot to fail without this code.  I still think there's a bug here because we can use kInvalidServiceWorkerProviderId due to sandboxed iframes, in which case TransferProviderHostIn will crash. But I'll fix that in a separate patch.

I had originally meant to refactor the two tests into a common function but didn't see a way to do that without using a new test class, which seemed like overkill. Since the tests are the exact same except for the secure vs insecure URL, I decided to just change the existing test to use the insecure URL, since secure URLs are exercise in other tests. Let me know if you'd rather have two separate tests, or have another idea.

I also removed the param from Frame::canChildBeSecure so now only Document::isSecureContext is responsible for populating the error message. I think the original idea was for the message to be more detailed about the exact error, but it's currently always just SecurityOrigin::isPotentiallyTrustworthyErrorMessage. ```     | **kinuko** | | nits only https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/360001/content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_provider\_host.h File content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_provider\_host.h (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/360001/content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_provider\_host.h#newcode96 content/browser/service\_worker/service\_worker\_provider\_host.h:96: } nit: why do we always translate ... | | --- | | 4 years, 6 months ago (2016-06-06 06:43:16 UTC) [#54](#msg54) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` nits only  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/360001/content/browser/servic...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/360001/content/browser/service_worker/service_worker_provider_host.h) File content/browser/service_worker/service_worker_provider_host.h (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/360001/content/browser/servic...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/360001/content/browser/service_worker/service_worker_provider_host.h#newcode96) content/browser/service_worker/service_worker_provider_host.h:96: } nit: why do we always translate enum to bool / bool to enum here?

I'm still a bit undecided about this. On the renderer-side, UNINITIALIZED is never used.  The renderer knows if the frame is secure or insecure, and sends that bool in the message.  On the browser-side... in non-plz-navigate case: we create the provider host once we get the IPC message. in the plz-navigate case: we create the provider before we get the IPC message. So we need UNINITIALIZED on the browser-side.  Having the IPC message use a bool restricts it to the allowed values, which is maybe a nicer than the enum. It also is simpler to work with: you can use an if/else instead of switch.

I think we have mild preference for enum over bool, while I see that having UNINITIALIZED only in limited cases is a bit unfortunate. I'll let it go now, but reg: if/else condition basically always checking security_level == SECURE seems to be equivalent too. ```     | **falken** | | falken@chromium.org changed reviewers: - raymes@chromium.org, tsepez@chromium.org | | --- | | 4 years, 6 months ago (2016-06-06 13:32:35 UTC) [#57](#msg57) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` falken@chromium.org changed reviewers: - raymes@chromium.org, tsepez@chromium.org ```     | **falken** | | Thanks.

An iframe within an insecure context is itself an insecure context, even if it is served from a secure scheme like https (see example 7 in <https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#examples-framed>).

The parents of a frame cannot change (if they do, the Frame/Document is no longer attached), nor can the security origin of a Document change. Instead, these bits ought to only be determined once, when the context is initialized.  (1) is hard to address in the near-term (something something FrameIOData?). (2) is something I'm hoping we can address sooner though.

# USN-3041-1: Oxide vulnerabilities

5 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1705](/security/CVE-2016-1705))

It was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the

origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms.

([CVE-2016-1706](/security/CVE-2016-1706))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a

deferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass

same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1710](/security/CVE-2016-1710))

It was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a

detach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1711](/security/CVE-2016-1711))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5127](/security/CVE-2016-5127))

It was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors

from modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5128](/security/CVE-2016-5128))

A memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5129](/security/CVE-2016-5129))

A security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL.

([CVE-2016-5130](/security/CVE-2016-5130))

A use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5131](/security/CVE-2016-5131))

The Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement

the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to

control a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5132](/security/CVE-2016-5132))

It was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy

authentication. A machine-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this

to spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. ([CVE-2016-5133](/security/CVE-2016-5133))

It was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium

does not ensure that URL information is restricted to a scheme, host and

port. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2016-5134](/security/CVE-2016-5134))

It was discovered that Blink does not consider referrer-policy information

inside an HTML document during a preload request. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP)

protections. ([CVE-2016-5135](/security/CVE-2016-5135))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in

Blink does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether a specific

HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-5137](/security/CVE-2016-5137))

I don't have a strong opinion (the early patchsets on the previous review did that) but jww@ and alexmos@ expressed a strong preference for sharing the code.  I'm loath to revert this now since I want it to pass through canary and get it merged ASAP.  I'll fire up a patch to change the public API part and see how it looks. ```     | **dcheng** | | On 2016/06/17 00:52:34, falken wrote: > On 2016/06/16 08:59:44, dcheng wrote: > > Sorry, I ... | | --- | | 4 years, 6 months ago (2016-06-17 06:49:24 UTC) [#17](#msg17) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` On 2016/06/17 00:52:34, falken wrote: > On 2016/06/16 08:59:44, dcheng wrote: > > Sorry, I didn't see this CL till now. > >  > > I thought about it a bit more the last few days, and I don't think we should > add > > the Blink public API for this.

FWIW, I supported sharing the code before we knew that we couldn't merge the duplicate calls in public API, but had the same concern as Daniel for that ([https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/120001/third_party/WebKit/pub...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2009453002/diff/120001/third_party/WebKit/public/web/WebFrame.h#newcode555)), so I'm ok with following Daniel's suggestion in a followup CL. ```     Expand Messages | Collapse Messages | Show Generated Messages | Hide Generated Messages |
