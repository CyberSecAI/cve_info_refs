Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how ImageMagick processes EXIF data, specifically within the `GetEXIFProperty` function in `MagickCore/property.c`. The code reads the number of entries inside a directory object in an image and uses this value in a loop to process EXIF data. By manipulating the number of entries, an attacker can control a pointer `q` and read data out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** By controlling the `number_entries` variable, the attacker can control how many times the loop in `GetEXIFProperty` iterates. Within this loop, the code calculates a pointer `q` which is used to access data within the EXIF profile. Because the attacker can control how many times this loop executes, they can cause q to be an address outside the valid memory region of the EXIF profile. Subsequently, when the code attempts to read data using the out-of-bounds pointer `q`, it results in an out-of-bounds read.

- **Insufficient checks:** The code lacks adequate bounds checking when calculating the `q` pointer, allowing it to point outside the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is information leakage. Because the out-of-bounds read allows the attacker to read arbitrary data from the process of ImageMagick, it could potentially expose sensitive data from the application's memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided crash information indicates that the out-of-bounds read can also lead to a crash due to the program attempting to read invalid memory. This may cause a denial-of-service.
- While not explicitly stated to cause RCE, the arbitrary read might be a building block for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file. In particular, the attacker needs to manipulate specific bytes within the image's EXIF data.
- The attack vector is through an image file, specifically a JPEG, containing crafted EXIF data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious image file with specific byte sequences that manipulate the EXIF directory structure. This requires some knowledge of the EXIF format and how ImageMagick parses it.
-   **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious image file to ImageMagick for processing. This could be through a web application, email, or any other service that uses ImageMagick to process images.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Ibrahim el-sayed.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in the commit [d8ab7f046587f2e9f734b687ba7e6e10147c294b](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/d8ab7f046587f2e9f734b687ba7e6e10147c294b), which adds additional checks to the `GetEXIFProperty` function, and also adds a check to prevent integer overflows on the calculation of `number_bytes`.
- The vulnerability was also addressed in Gentoo via GLSA 201611-21.
