- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflows and out-of-bounds write conditions exist in the Delta Electronics WPLSoft, ISPSoft, and PMSoft software applications. These are triggered when the software loads malformed project files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122): Multiple instances of heap-based buffer overflows that could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    - Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787): Multiple instances of out-of-bounds write conditions could allow execution of malicious files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerabilities are triggered by loading specially crafted project files (e.g., .dvp files) using the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince a local user to open a malformed file using the vulnerable software. This requires social engineering. An attacker needs to have a local presence on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
