Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-5740:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in Open-Xchange App Suite 7.8.2 and earlier versions, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). There are three distinct vulnerable areas identified:

1.  **Resource Description Fields:** Description fields for resources can be used to inject malicious HTML/JS code. This code is executed when a user views the details of an appointment that includes the manipulated resource.
2.  **HTML Email Hyperlinks:** Malicious script code can be injected into HTML email hyperlinks by using the "data" schema, bypassing existing sanitization methods. The injected script executes when a user clicks on the malicious link displayed in the OX App Suite UI.
3.  **Temporary Storage for Inline Images:** Script code can be stored in temporary storage meant for inline images in HTML emails. This content can be accessed by the user who stored it and other (external) users if the unique random ID is known.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via:
    *   Unsanitized resource description fields
    *   Lack of sanitization when processing "data" schema URLs in email hyperlinks.
    *   Insecure handling of temporary storage for inline images which allows for script injection via modified upload requests and specific MIME types.
*   Insufficient input validation and sanitization.
*   Bypass of sanitization methods through the use of the `data` scheme in hyperlinks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Execution of malicious script code within the context of a user's session.
*   Potential for session hijacking.
*   Ability to trigger unwanted actions through the web interface (e.g., sending emails, deleting data).
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Resource Description XSS:** An attacker with resource modification permissions injects malicious HTML/JS code into a resource description. They then add this resource to a group appointment. Users who view the details of the appointment will execute the injected code.
2.  **Email Hyperlink XSS:** An attacker crafts a malicious email containing a hyperlink using the "data" schema and embedding JavaScript code. When a user clicks the malicious link in the OX App Suite UI, the script will execute.
3.  **Inline Image Storage XSS:** An attacker creates a file with script code (e.g., an SVG image with XSL headers), modifies the upload request to bypass checks, sets a specific MIME type, and then creates a link to the storage location. When a user clicks this link, the stored script executes in the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For resource description XSS, the attacker needs permissions to create or modify resources.
*   For email hyperlink XSS, the attacker needs the ability to send or control the content of an email received by a target user.
*   For inline image storage XSS, the attacker needs access to the application's upload mechanism.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into viewing the malicious resource, clicking a malicious link, or accessing the manipulated inline image storage link.

The exploit requires user interaction, making the impact somewhat mitigated.
