# Android Security Bulletin—April 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published April 03, 2017 | Updated August 17, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of April 05, 2017 or later address all of these
issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on March 06, 2017
or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the Android
Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin
also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-04-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-04-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    and 2017-04-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.

## Android and Google Service Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2016_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-04-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-04-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the April 01, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of April 05, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-04-01](#2017-04-01-details) and
[2017-04-05](#2017-04-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

## Revisions

* April 03, 2017: Bulletin published.
* April 05, 2017: Bulletin revised to include AOSP links.
* April 21, 2017: Attribution for CVE-2016-10231 and CVE-2017-0586 corrected.
* April 27, 2017: CVE-2017-0540 removed from bulletin.

# USN-3041-1: Oxide vulnerabilities

5 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1705](/security/CVE-2016-1705))

It was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the

origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms.

([CVE-2016-1706](/security/CVE-2016-1706))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a

deferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass

same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1710](/security/CVE-2016-1710))

It was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a

detach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1711](/security/CVE-2016-1711))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5127](/security/CVE-2016-5127))

It was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors

from modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5128](/security/CVE-2016-5128))

A memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5129](/security/CVE-2016-5129))

A security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL.

([CVE-2016-5130](/security/CVE-2016-5130))

A use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5131](/security/CVE-2016-5131))

The Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement

the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to

control a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5132](/security/CVE-2016-5132))

It was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy

authentication. A machine-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this

to spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. ([CVE-2016-5133](/security/CVE-2016-5133))

It was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium

does not ensure that URL information is restricted to a scheme, host and

port. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2016-5134](/security/CVE-2016-5134))

It was discovered that Blink does not consider referrer-policy information

inside an HTML document during a preload request. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP)

protections. ([CVE-2016-5135](/security/CVE-2016-5135))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in

Blink does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether a specific

HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-5137](/security/CVE-2016-5137))

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/07/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, July 20, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 52 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 52.0.2743.82 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/51.0.2704.106..52.0.2743.82?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 52.
#### Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [48 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M52). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[629852](https://crbug.com/629852)] CVE-2016-1705: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
