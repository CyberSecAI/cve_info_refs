Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-5155:

**CVE-2016-5155**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of access to the initial document within the Google Chrome browser. Specifically, the browser does not adequately verify if a script or other code should have access to the document of a window, especially when that window is being returned by a function or property.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Access Validation:** The core weakness lies in the inadequate checks performed before granting access to a window's initial document. The checks were previously only performed on property lookups, which left function invocations vulnerable.
    *   **Bypassing securityCheck():** It was possible to access the document of a window by bypassing the securityCheck() in V8Window.cpp

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Address Bar Spoofing:** A remote attacker could successfully spoof the address bar, misleading the user about the actual origin of the displayed content. This could be used for phishing or other social engineering attacks.
    *  **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the possibility of other unspecified impacts is mentioned in some of the reports which could include arbitrary code execution due to the nature of address bar spoofing being able to trick users into divulging more information.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Crafted Web Site:** The primary attack vector is a malicious or specially crafted web site designed to exploit the insufficient access validation.
    *   **Function Invocation:** Attackers could specifically target function invocations because V8 does not check security for function calls.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, needing only to serve the malicious web content to the user.
    *   **User Interaction:** The victim has to visit the crafted website.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by implementing a check at every call to `BindingSecurity::shouldAllowAccessTo()`. This is because V8, the JavaScript engine used in Chrome, only calls back `securityCheck()` on property lookups, not for function invocations.
*   The fix ensures that the access to the initial document is validated whenever a cross-origin window is accessed.
*   The vulnerability was present in Google Chrome before version 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X, and before version 53.0.2785.92 on Linux.
*   The fix involved changes to several files, including `V8WindowCustom.cpp`, `DOMWindow.cpp`, `BindingSecurity.h`, `BindingSecurity.cpp` and `interface_base.cpp`.
*   This vulnerability is related to the fix for issue 630662 in the chromium bug tracker.

The provided information includes more detail than the official CVE description, such as the technical explanation for why the fix was needed (V8 security checks on property lookups only) and the specific code files that were modified to implement the fix.
