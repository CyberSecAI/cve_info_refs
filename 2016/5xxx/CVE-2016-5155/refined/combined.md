## Issue [2177233002](/2177233002/): binding: Calls didAccessInitialDocument() for a returned Window. (Closed)

| **Created:** 4 years, 5 months ago by [Yuki](/user/Yuki)  **Modified:** 4 years, 4 months ago  **Reviewers:**  **CC:** chromium-reviews, blink-reviews, blink-reviews-bindings\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | Descriptionbinding: Calls didAccessInitialDocument() for a returned Window. Calls didAccessInitialDocument() as soon as we return a Window object that is not top/parent/self/window/frames. As long as it's possible to access to the document of a window with bypassing securityCheck() in V8Window.cpp, we need to check the access to the initial document as soon as we return a Window object. top/parent should be already checked, so we don't need this check there. self/window/frames return itself, so we don't need the check there, either.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5153 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5153)

#### Description

The Web Animations implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, improperly relies on list iteration, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-destruction) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site.

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_31.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, August 31, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 53 to the stable channel - 53.0.2785.89 for Windows, Mac and 53.0.2785.92 for Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks **(Note:** **MSI still points to M52 and will be updated later).**

Chrome 53.0.2785.89 and 53.0.2785.92 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/52.0.2743.116..53.0.2785.92?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 53.
Security Fixes and Rewards

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[642598](https://crbug.com/642598)] CVE-2016-5167: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

## Issue [2209303002](/2209303002/): binding: Moves the check for the first access to the initial document into BindingSecurity. (Closed)

| **Created:** 4 years, 4 months ago by [Yuki](/user/Yuki)  **Modified:** 4 years, 4 months ago  **Reviewers:** [haraken](/user/haraken), [benwells](/user/benwells), [Torne](/user/Torne), [meacer](/user/meacer)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, blink-reviews, blink-reviews-bindings\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | Descriptionbinding: Moves the check for the first access to the initial document into BindingSecurity. Checks the access to the initial document and reports it not only at securityCheck() in V8Window.cpp but also at every call to BindingSecurity::shouldAllowAccessTo() because V8 only calls back securityCheck() on property lookups, and not for function invocation. BindingSecurity::shouldAllowAccessTo() is called with every possible cross-origin window, which means every possible new window. Thus, shouldAllowAccessTo() should be the right place to check the access to the initial document.

My execuses are: 1)   if (!( complex okay condition ))     early exit (return, throw, exit, etc.); is a common pattern (as a substitute of unless(...)). 2)   if (x && x->foo()) is also a common short-circuit pattern.   if (!x || !x->foo()) is a bit less easy to read (for me).

You're right.  Not necessarily, but it's intentional.  If a window does not have access to another window, there must be no chance to modify the initial document of another window.  So, there is no need to call didAccessInitialDocument.  Having said that, it's also true that there are more call sites of BindingSecurity::shouldAllowAccessTo() than the call sites of securityCheck(). ```     | **haraken** | | LGTM | | --- | | 4 years, 4 months ago (2016-08-15 04:32:12 UTC) [#33](#msg33) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` LGTM ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | The CQ bit was unchecked by commit-bot@chromium.org | | --- | | 4 years, 4 months ago (2016-08-15 04:56:02 UTC) [#34](#msg34) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` The CQ bit was unchecked by commit-bot@chromium.org ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | Dry run: This issue passed the CQ dry run. | | --- | | 4 years, 4 months ago (2016-08-15 04:56:02 UTC) [#35](#msg35) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Dry run: This issue passed the CQ dry run. ```     | **Yuki** | | Description was changed from ========== binding: Moves the check for the first access to the ... | | --- | | 4 years, 4 months ago (2016-08-16 05:36:09 UTC) [#36](#msg36) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Description was changed from  ========== binding: Moves the check for the first access to the initial document into BindingSecurity.
