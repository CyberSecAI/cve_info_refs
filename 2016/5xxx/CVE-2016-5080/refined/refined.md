  "CVE-2016-5080": {
    "description": "A vulnerability found in the runtime support libraries of the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ from Objective Systems Inc. could allow an attacker to remotely execute code in software systems, including embedded software and firmware, that use code generated by the ASN1C compiler. The vulnerability could be triggered remotely without any authentication in scenarios where the vulnerable code receives and processes ASN.1 encoded data from untrusted sources",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflows in the `rtxMemHeapAlloc` function within the ASN1C compiler's runtime support library for C/C++, leading to heap memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to integer overflow when calculating memory allocation size",
      "Lack of validation of input size (`nbytes`) before rounding it to a multiple of 8 and adding a heap control structure size, leading to integer overflow.",
      "Lack of validation before calling malloc"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service due to heap memory corruption. Attackers may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing of ASN.1 encoded data from untrusted sources such as network communications.",
       "Specially crafted ASN.1 data with large size values can trigger integer overflows and heap corruption.",
      "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely without authentication."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to provide specially crafted ASN.1 data.",
       "No authentication required."
    ],
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `rtxMemHeapAlloc` function, which calculates the size of the memory to be allocated by rounding up the input nbytes to the nearest multiple of 8 before allocating it. Two integer overflows can occur: first when the input is rounded to the next multiple of 8 before the internal heap is allocated, and again when malloc is called. In both cases, this causes an inadequate buffer size being used which eventually causes a heap overflow.",

    "Software systems using Objective Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++ version 7.0 or below",
    "Cisco ASR 5000 devices running StarOS versions 17.x, 18.x, 19.x, and 20.x",
