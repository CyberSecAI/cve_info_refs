### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

Heap memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing code generated by Objective
Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Heap memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing code generated by
Objective Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++
Advisory ID: STIC-2016-0603
Advisory URL: <http://www.fundacionsadosky.org.ar/publicaciones-2>
Date published: 2016-07-18
Date of last update: 2016-07-19
Vendors contacted: Objective Systems Inc.
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Heap-based Buffer Overflow [CWE-122]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Identifier: CVE-2016-5080

3. *Vulnerability Description*

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a technical standard and formal
notation that describes rules and structures for representing, encoding,
transmitting, and decoding data in telecommunications and computer
networking[1]. It is a joint standard of the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC), and International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
Standardization Sector ITU-T[2] used in technical standards for wireless
communications such as GSM, UMTS and LTE, Lawful Interception,
Intelligent Transportation Systems, signalling in fixed and mobile
telecommunications networks (SS7), wireless broadband access (WiMAX),
data security (X.509), network management (SNMP), voice over IP and
IP-based videoconferencing (H.323), manufacturing, aviation, aerospace
and several other areas[3].

Software components that generate, transmit and parse ASN.1 encoded data
constitute a critical building block of software that runs on billions
of mobile devices, telecommunication switching equipment and systems for
operation and management of critical infrastructures. The ASN.1
specification is sufficiently complicated to make writing programs that
parse ASN.1 encoded data a perilious and error-prone activity. Many
technology vendors have adopted the practice of using computer-generated
programs to parse ASN.1 encoded data. This is accomplished by using an
ASN.1 compiler, a software tool that given as input a data specification
written in ASN.1 generates as output the source code of a program that
can be used to encode and decode in  compliance with the specification.
The output of an ASN.1 compiler is generally incorporated as a building
block in a software system that transmits or processes ASN.1 encoded data.

 Objective Systems Inc. is a US-based private company[5] that develops
and commercializes ASN1C, a ASN1 compiler for various programming
languages, to vendors in the telecommunications, data networking,
aviation, aerospace, defense and law enforcement sectors[6].

A vulnerability found in the runtime support libraries of the ASN1C
compiler for C/C++ from Objective Systems Inc. could allow an attacker
to remotely execute code in software systems, including embedded
software and firmware, that use code generated by the ASN1C compiler.
The vulnerability could be triggered remotely without any authentication
in scenarios where the vulnerable code receives and processes ASN.1
encoded data from untrusted sources, these may include communications
between mobile devices and telecommunication network infrastructure
nodes, communications between nodes in a carrier's network or across
carrier boundaries, or communication between mutually untrusted
endpoints in a data network.

Objective Systems Inc. has addressed the issue and built a fixed interim
version of the ASN1C for C/C++ compiler that is a available to customers
upon request. The fixes will be incorporated in the next (v7.0.2)
release of ASN1C for C/C++.

For further information about vulnerable vendors and available fixes
refer to the CERT/CC vulnerability note [4].

4. *Vulnerable packages*

  Software systems that use ASN.1 parsing code generated with Objective
Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++ version 7.0 or below. Refer to the
CERT/CC vulnerability note[4] for a list of potentially affected vendors.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Vendor fixed the issue in an interim release of the ASN1C v7.0.1
compiler available to customers upon request[5]. The upcoming ASN1C
v7.0.2 release will incorporate the fixes.

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Lucas Molas. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Programa Seguridad en TIC.

7. *Technical Description*

This document details a bug found in the latest release of Objective
Systems Inc,. ASN1C  compiler for C/C++ (v7.0.0), particularly in the
'rtxMemHeapAlloc' function contained in the pre-compiled 'asn1rt_a.lib'
library, where two integer overflows have been detected, which could
lead to corruption of heap memory in an attacker-controlled scenario.

The component analyzed was the "evaluation package of ASN1C" (v7.0.0)
for Windows (x86) MSVC 32-bit, but the analysis also applies to other
platforms. The analysis was performed with the IDA (v6.9) disassembler,
from which the assembly blocks shown below have been extracted (the
assembly syntax and location addresses may vary).

The pre-compiled library analyzed, 'asn1rt_a.lib', was extracted from
'<installdir>\c\lib\' (which corresponds to the Visual C++ 2013 version).

 In 'rtxMemHeapAlloc', after initial checks to the context's internal
memory heap ('pMemHeap') which may entail calls to 'rtxMemHeapCreate'
and 'rtxMemHeapCheck', the 'nbytes' argument ('arg_4' in the
disassembly) is manipulated. Its value is rounded to the next multiple
of 8 bytes using 'ecx' and storing the result in 'var_9C'. To accomplish
this, a value of '7' is added to 'ecx' before making the shift without
checking the resulting value, which could lead to an integer overflow of
the 32-bit register if the value of 'nbytes' is '0xFFFFFFF9' or higher.
The following assembly blocks illustrate this.

/-----
  loc_A6:
  mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_4]
  add     ecx, 7
  shr     ecx, 3
  mov     [ebp+var_9C], ecx
  mov     edx, [ebp+var_18]
  mov     eax, [edx+18h]
  and     eax, 20000000h
  jnz     short loc_D2

-----/

The 'rtxMemHeapAlloc'  function does not perform any validation of the
'nbytes' argument and therefore it is up to the caller to make sure its
value does not overflow when the allocator rounds it up to a multiple of
8 bytes and adds 20 bytes to the memory to be allocated to accomodate a
heap control structure. However, the caller of 'rtxMemHeapAlloc' will be
a function automatically generated by the ASN1C compiler and typically
will not have any size contrains on the arguments passed to
'rtxMemHeapAlloc', and indireddctly to 'malloc', unless added manually.
The resulting value of 'var_9C' is checked against the constant '0FFFCh'
to decide whether to allocate the memory requested using the internal
heap implementation or the system's memory allocator, which is usually
available through the 'malloc' function.

A similar pattern is found later when 'malloc' is called.

If 'malloc'  is used, the value in 'var_9C' is discarded in favor of the
original value of the 'nbytes' argument. This value is added to '14h' in
'ecx' before saving it to 'var_E8' without any validation which could
lead to an integer overflow if the value of argument 'nbytes' is
'0xFFFFFFEC' or greater. The resulting value in 'var_E8' is then used as
the argument for the call to 'malloc'. As a consequence, large values
passsed in the 'nbytes'  argument to 'rtxMemHeapAlloc'  will result in a
size calculation that wraps around and ends up calling 'malloc' with a
size argument that is less that what is needed to store the data that
will be copied to it later on. The following assembly block illustrates
this.

/-----
  loc_D2:
  mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_4]
  add     ecx, 14h
  mov     [ebp+var_E8], ecx
  mov     edx, [ebp+var_E8]
  push    edx
  mov     eax, [ebp+var_18]
  mov     ecx, [eax+1Ch]
  call    ecx
  add     esp, 4
  mov     [ebp+var_24], eax
  cmp     [ebp+var_24], 0
  jnz     short loc_120

-----/

Due to the fact that the bugs are located in the core runtime support
library, it is hard to assess its exploitability in all scenarios but it
is safe to assume that it would lead attacker controlled memory
corruption of either the system's heap (if 'malloc' is called) or in the
internal memory allocator (if the number of bytes requested is below the
aforementioned threshold). Since heap control structures can be
overwritten with attacker controlled data, it is safe to assume that
remote code execution can be achieved in many scenarios in which ASN.1
parsing code generated by the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ is used without
manual modification. Manual modification of automatically generated code
is generally not recommended so mechanisms that would prevent triggering
of these bugs are not likely to be found in deployed systems.

As an illustrative example, the 3GPP APIs can be mentioned, particularly
the '[NAS/RRC add-on for ASN1C SDK]'[7]. The C code generated by the
ASN1C for the RRC decoder ('EUTRA-RRC-DefinitionsDec.c'), uses
'rtxMemHeapAlloc' for the allocation of the extension optional bits of
the extension elements) where the length, not known in advance, is
obtained from the encoded element received from an untrusted source,
calling 'pd_SmallLength' which allows unconstrained whole numbers,
resulting in a call to 'rtxMemHeapAlloc'  with an externally controlled
'nbytes' argument. The following ASN1C compiler generated C code snipped
from the function 'asn1PD_RadioResourceConfigCommonSIB' illustrates this.

/-----
   /* decode extension elements */
   if (extbit) {
      OSOCTET* poptbits;

      /* decode extension optional bits length */

      stat = pd_SmallLength (pctxt, &bitcnt);
      if (stat != 0) return stat;

      poptbits = (OSOCTET*) rtxMemAlloc (pctxt, bitcnt);
      if (0 == poptbits) return RTERR_NOMEM;

      for (i_ = 0; i_ < bitcnt; i_++) {
         stat = DEC_BIT (pctxt, &poptbits[i_]);
         if (stat != 0)  {
            rtxMemFreePtr (pctxt, poptbits);
            return stat;
         }
      }

as internal tracking number.

. 2016-06-08:

        Email sent to CERT/CC saying that the bug is present in code
generated by the ASN1C compiler for C, it is also likely that C++ code
is also buggy and not likely in Java code but neither C++ not Java code
were tested.

. 2016-06-10:

        Email sent to the vendor requesting acknowledgement of the
report sent on June 6 and noting that CERT/CC was contacted.

. 2016-06-10:

        Vendor acknowledged reception of the bug report and stated that
it will look into the issue as time permits.

. 2016-06-14:

        Objective Systems Inc. indicated that the issues were fixed in
an interim v7.0.1.x version of ASN1C that will be available to customers
upon request and that the next v7.0.2 release will incorporate the
fixes. Offered a version of ASN1C updated with the fixes for testing.

. 2016-06-14:

        Programa STIC replied to the vendor accepting the offer for the
pre-release version of ASN1C with the fixes and stated it is on track
for publication on July 6.

. 2016-06-15:

        Programa STIC notified CERT/CC that the vendor has fixed the
issues and will make available an updated version of ASN1C to customers
upon request. Asked CERT/CC about plans for dissemination of the report
and whether it had contact information for ITU IMPACT. Publication is
still planned for July 6.

. 2016-06-16:

         Objective Systems provided a fixed version of ASN1C for testing.

. 2016-06-16:

         CERT/CC replied saying they have no contact information for ITU
IMPACT but will try to reach as many potentially affected vendors as
possible. The vulnerabilities were assigned the CVE-2016-5080
identifier. CERT/CC will likely publish a Vulnerability Note on its
website once the report becomes public.

. 2016-06-16:

         Programa STIC said that vendors will need to assess whether
they're vulnerable and determine if they want to ask Objective Systems
for the fixed interim v7.0.1.x version or wait for the v7.0.2 release.
Programa STIC recommends the former since the v7.0.2 release may include
non-security fixed and feature and does not have a estimated release
date at the moment.

. 2016-06-27:

        Programa STIC sent mail to CERT/CC requesting a status update
and saying its on track to publish on July 6.

. 2016-07-01:

        CERT/CC replied saying one of the contacted vendors requested to
delay the publication for 2 months while they investigate their
products. Asked if Programa STIC would accept the request or proceed
with the current publication date.

. 2016-07-01:

        Programa STIC replied that a two month delay seemed excessive
and that at least 2 additional factors should be weighed: 1. memory
corruption bugs in ASN.1 related components of an LTE stack have been
announced or hinted at in several infosec conference presentations over
the past few weeks and its likely the same or similar bugs will become
public soon. 2. Objective Systems has already produced a fix that is
available upon request to all its customers. It does not seem reasonable
to impose a 2 month publication delay on every other vendor. Asked
CERT/CC: 1. Did other vendors request to postpone publication or
indicated they were or were not vulnerable? 2. Did CERT/CC disseminate
the information to any other parties?

. 2016-07-01:

        CERT/CC indicated they've contacted as many vendors as possible,
US-CERT and international CERT partners and that only one vendor has
requested to delay publication so far. Agreed that proceeding with the
original publication schedule is reasonable given the partial disclosure
due to dissemination that already occurred plus the fact that a fix is
available

. 2016-07-01:

       Programa STIC sent mail to CERT/CC saying that for the moment it
will proceed with the original deadline but make a final decision on July 5.

. 2016-07-06:

       Programa STIC sent email to CERT/CC indicating it decided to
postpone publication for a week to give vendors some additional time to
assess whether they are vulnerable and plan for issuing fixes. The new
publication date was set to July 13.

. 2016-07-06:

       CERT/CC replied that it will notify vendors of the new
publication date.

. 2016-07-13:

       CERT/CC asked if the security advisory was published and
requested an URL for it.

. 2016-07-14:

       Programa STIC told CERT/CC that publication was postponed to
Monday, July 18.

| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:U/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 8.5 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 8.5 |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 301 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2456979.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 11 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

# Android Security Bulletin—January 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published January 03, 2017 | Updated February 2, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of January 05, 2017 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on December 05,
2016 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-01-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-01-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01
    and 2017-01-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the January
  05, 2017 security patch level.

## Security vulnerability summary

The tables below contains a list of security vulnerabilities, the Common
Vulnerability and Exposures ID (CVE), the assessed severity, and whether or not
Google devices are affected. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-01-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-01-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-01-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-01-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the January 1, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of January 5, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-01-01](#2017-01-01-details) and
[2017-01-05](#2017-01-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running the
  latest available version of Android are affected by the issue, the table
  will have "None" in the *Updated Google devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

## Objective Systems ASN1C generates code that contains a heap overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#790839

Original Release Date: 2016-07-19 | Last Revised: 2016-08-26

---

### Overview

ASN.1 is a standard representation of data for networking and telecommunications applications. Objective System's ASN1C compiler generates C and C++ code that may be vulnerable to heap overflow.

### Description

| [**CWE-122**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)**: Heap-based Buffer Overflow -** CVE-2016-5080  ASN1C is used to generate high-level-language code from ASN.1 syntax. According to the reporter, the generated C and C++ code from ASN1C may be vulnerable to heap overflow in the generated heap manager's rtxMemHeapAlloc function. It is currently unclear if a similar vulnerability exists in other output languages such as Java. and C#. A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the heap overflow to execute arbitrary code on the underlying system, but the availability of this exploit depends on whether the application utilizes the rtxMemHeapAlloc function in an unsafe way. In particular, the application would likely need to process ASN.1 data from untrusted sources to be vulnerable. Developers making use of ASN1C in their products should audit their code to determine if their application is vulnerable. The CVSS score below reflects a worst-case scenario, and may not apply to all instances.The researcher has more information available in a [security advisory](https://github.com/programa-stic/security-advisories/tree/master/ObjSys/CVE-2016-5080). |
| --- |

### Impact

| The impact may vary depending on how the vulnerable code is used in an application. In worst case, an application that utilizes ASN.1 data from untrusted sources may be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with permissions of the application (typically root/SYSTEM). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Objective Systems has released a hotfix for the ASN1C 7.0.1.x series to correct this flaw. Customers using the vulnerable features should contact Objective Systems directly to request the hotfix. Customers may also alternately use a different heap manager, or edit the generated code by hand to remove the heap overflow.ASN1C version 7.0.2 will contain the fix for all customers, but its release date is currently not set. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| The vendors listed below were primarily sourced from Objective Systems' customer list. The CERT/CC has no further evidence that any particular vendor is impacted unless marked Affected; vendors are encouraged to reach out to us to clarify their status. |

## 3. Vulnerability Description

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a technical standard and formal notation that describes rules and structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data in telecommunications and computer networking[1]. It is a joint standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector ITU-T[2] used in technical standards for wireless communications such as GSM, UMTS and LTE, Lawful Interception, Intelligent Transportation Systems, signalling in fixed and mobile telecommunications networks (SS7), wireless broadband access (WiMAX), data security (X.509), network management (SNMP), voice over IP and IP-based videoconferencing (H.323), manufacturing, aviation, aerospace and several other areas[3].

Software components that generate, transmit and parse ASN.1 encoded data constitute a critical building block of software that runs on billions of mobile devices, telecommunication switching equipment and systems for operation and management of critical infrastructures. The ASN.1 specification is sufficiently complicated to make writing programs that parse ASN.1 encoded data a perilious and error-prone activity. Many technology vendors have adopted the practice of using computer-generated programs to parse ASN.1 encoded data. This is accomplished by using an ASN.1 compiler, a software tool that given as input a data specification written in ASN.1 generates as output the source code of a program that can be used to encode and decode in compliance with the specification. The output of an ASN.1 compiler is generally incorporated as a building block in a software system that transmits or processes ASN.1 encoded data.

Objective Systems Inc. is a US-based private company[5] that develops and commercializes ASN1C, a ASN1 compiler for various programming languages, to vendors in the telecommunications, data networking, aviation, aerospace, defense and law enforcement sectors[6].

A vulnerability found in the runtime support libraries of the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ from Objective Systems Inc. could allow an attacker to remotely execute code in software systems, including embeded software and firmware, that use code generated by the ASN1C compiler. The vulnerability could be triggered remotely without any authentication in scenarios where the vulnerable code receives and processes ASN.1 encoded data from untrusted sources, these may include communications between mobile devices and telecommunication network infrastructure nodes, communications between nodes in a carrier's network or across carrier boundaries, or communication between mutually untrusted endpoints in a data network.

Objective Systemns Inc. has addressed the issue and built a fixed interim version of the ASN1C for C/C++ compiler that is a available to customers upon request. The fixes will be incorporated in the next (v7.0.2) release of ASN1C for C/C++.

For further information about vulnerable vendors and available fixes refer to the CERT/CC vulnerability note [4].

## 4. Vulnerable packages

Software systems that use ASN.1 parsing code generated with Objective Systems Inc. ASN1C compiler for C/C++ version 7.0 or below. Refer to the CERT/CC vulnerability note[4] for a list of potentially affected vendors.

## 5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Vendor fixed the issue in an interim release of the ASN1C v7.0.1 compiler available to customers upon request[5]. The upcoming ASN1C v7.0.2 release will incorporate the fixes.

## 6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Lucas Molas. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Programa Seguridad en TIC.

## 7. Technical Description

This document details a bug found in the latest release of Objective Systems Inc,. ASN1C compiler for C/C++ (v7.0.0), particularly in the *rtxMemHeapAlloc* function contained in the pre-compiled *asn1rt\_a.lib* library, where two integer overflows have been detected, which could lead to corruption of heap memory in an attacker-controlled scenario.

The component analyzed was the "evaluation package of ASN1C" (v7.0.0) for Windows (x86) MSVC 32-bit, but the analysis also applies to other platforms. The analysis was performed with the IDA (v6.9) disassembler, from which the assembly blocks shown below have been extracted (the assembly syntax and location addresses may vary).

The pre-compiled library analyzed, *asn1rt\_a.lib*, was extracted from \_\c\lib\_ (which corresponds to the Visual C++ 2013 version).

In *rtxMemHeapAlloc*, after initial checks to the context's internal memory heap (*pMemHeap*) which may entail calls to *rtxMemHeapCreate* and *rtxMemHeapCheck*, the *nbytes* argument (*arg\_4* in the disassembly) is manipulated. Its value is rounded to the next multiple of 8 bytes using *ecx* and storing the result in *var\_9C*. To accomplish this, a value of *7* is added to *ecx* before making the shift without checking the resulting value, which could lead to an integer overflow of the 32-bit register if the value of *nbytes* is *0xFFFFFFF9* or higher. The following assembly blocks illustrate this.

```
  loc_A6:
  mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_4]
  add     ecx, 7
  shr     ecx, 3
  mov     [ebp+var_9C], ecx
  mov     edx, [ebp+var_18]
  mov     eax, [edx+18h]
  and     eax, 20000000h
  jnz     short loc_D2

```

The *rtxMemHeapAlloc* function does not perform any validation of the *nbytes* argument and therefore it is up to the caller to make sure its value does not overflow when the allocator rounds it up to a multiple of 8 bytes and adds 20 bytes to the memory to be allocated to accomodate a heap control structure. However, the caller of *rtxMemHeapAlloc* will be a function automatically generated by the ASN1C compiler and typically will not have any size contrains on the arguments passed to *rtxMemHeapAlloc*, and indireddctly to *malloc*, unless added manually.
The resulting value of *var\_9C* is checked against the constant *0FFFCh* to decide whether to allocate the memory requested using the internal heap implementation or the system's memory allocator, which is usually available through the *malloc* function.

A similar pattern is found later when *malloc* is called.

If *malloc* is used, the value in *var\_9C* is discarded in favor of the original value of the *nbytes* argument. This value is added to *14h* in *ecx* before saving it to *var\_E8* without any validation which could lead to an integer overflow if the value of argument *nbytes* is *0xFFFFFFEC* or greater. The resulting value in *var\_E8* is then used as the argument for the call to *malloc*. As a consequence, large values passsed in the *nbytes* argument to *rtxMemHeapAlloc* will result in a size calculation that wraps around and ends up calling *malloc* with a size argument that is less that what is needed to store the data that will be copied to it later on. The following assembly block illustrates this.

```
  loc_D2:
  mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_4]
  add     ecx, 14h
  mov     [ebp+var_E8], ecx
  mov     edx, [ebp+var_E8]
  push    edx
  mov     eax, [ebp+var_18]
  mov     ecx, [eax+1Ch]
  call    ecx
  add     esp, 4
  mov     [ebp+var_24], eax
  cmp     [ebp+var_24], 0
  jnz     short loc_120

```

Due to the fact that the bugs are located in the core runtime support library, it is hard to assess its exploitability in all scenarios but it is safe to assume that it would lead attacker controlled memory corruption of either the system's heap (if *malloc* is called) or in the internal memory allocator (if the number of bytes requested is below the aforementioned threshold). Since heap control structures can be overwritten with attacker controlled data, it is safe to assume that remote code execution can be achieved in many scenarios in which ASN.1 parsing code generated by the ASN1C compiler for C/C++ is used without manual modification. Manual modification of automatically generated code is generally not recommended so mechanisms that would prevent triggering of these bugs are not likely to be found in deployed systems.

As an illustrative example, the 3GPP APIs can be mentioned, particularly the *[NAS/RRC add-on for ASN1C SDK]*[7]. The C code generated by the ASN1C for the RRC decoder (*EUTRA-RRC-DefinitionsDec.c*), uses *rtxMemHeapAlloc* for the allocation of the extension optional bits of the extension elements) where the length, not known in advance, is obtained from the encoded element received from an untrusted source, calling *pd\_SmallLength* which allows unconstrained whole numbers, resulting in a call to *rtxMemHeapAlloc* with an externally controlled *nbytes* argument. The following ASN1C compiler generated C code snipped from the function *asn1PD\_RadioResourceConfigCommonSIB* illustrates this.

```
   /* decode extension elements */
   if (extbit) {
      OSOCTET* poptbits;

      /* decode extension optional bits length */

      stat = pd_SmallLength (pctxt, &bitcnt);
      if (stat != 0) return stat;

      poptbits = (OSOCTET*) rtxMemAlloc (pctxt, bitcnt);
      if (0 == poptbits) return RTERR_NOMEM;

      for (i_ = 0; i_ < bitcnt; i_++) {
         stat = DEC_BIT (pctxt, &poptbits[i_]);
         if (stat != 0)  {
            rtxMemFreePtr (pctxt, poptbits);
            return stat;
         }
      }

```

* **2016-06-06:**
  Vendor responded with contact information to send the bug report in plaintext.
* **2016-06-06:**
  Bug report sent in plaintext to the email address provided by the vendor. The report included technical details to identify and reproduce the bug. Vendor is notified that CERT/CC will be contacted and that a security bulletin will be published. Publication date set to July 6, 2016.
* **2016-06-08:**
  CERT/CC contacted, bug report filed in a web form, encrypted using the CERT/CC PGP public key.
* **2016-06-08:**
  CERT/CC replied by email acknowledging report, assigned VR-198 as internal tracking number.
* **2016-06-08:**
  Email sent to CERT/CC saying that the bug is present in code generated by the ASN1C compiler for C, it is also likely that C++ code is also buggy and not likely in Java code but neither C++ not Java code were tested.
* **2016-06-10:**
  Email sent to the vendor requesting acknowledgement of the report sent on June 6 and noting that CERT/CC was contacted.
* **2016-06-10:**
  Vendor acknowledged reception of the bug report and stated that it will look into the issue as time permits.
* **2016-06-14:**
  Objective Systems Inc. indicated that the issues were fixed in an interim v7.0.1.x version of ASN1C that will be available to customers upon request and that the next v7.0.2 release will incorporate the fixes. Offered a version of ASN1C updated with the fixes for testing.
* **2016-06-14:**
  Programa STIC replied to ghd vendor accepting the offer for the pre-release version of ASN1C with the fixes and stated it is on track for publication on july 6.
* **2016-06-15:**
  Programa STIC notified CERT/CC that the vendor has fixed the issues and will make available an updated version of ASN1C to customners upon request. Asked CERT/CC about plans for dissemination of the report and whether it had contact information for ITU IMPACT. Publication is still planned for July 6.
* **2016-06-16:**
  Objective Systems provided a fixed version of ASN1C for testing.
* **2016-06-16:**
  CERT/CC replied saying they have no contact information for ITU IMPACT but will try to reach as many potentially affected vendors as possible. The vulnerabilities were assigned the CVE-2016-5080 identifier. CERT/CC will likely publish a Vulnerability Note on its website once the report becomes public.
* **2016-06-16:**
  Programa STIC said that vendors will need to assess whether they're vulnerable and determine if they want to ask Objective Systems for the fixed interim v7.0.1.x version or wait for the v7.0.2 release. Programa STIC recommends the former since the v7.0.2 release may include non-security fixed and feature and does not have a estimated rlease date at the moment.
* **2016-06-27:**
  Programa STIC sent mail to CERT/CC requesting a status update and saying its on track to publish on July 6.
* **2016-07-01:**
  CERT/CC replied saying one of the contacted vendors requested to delay the publication for 2 months while they investigate their products. Asked if Programa STIC would accept the request or proceed with the current publication date.
* **2016-07-01:**
  Programa STIC replied that a two month delay seemed excesive and that at least 2 additional factors should be weighed: 1. memory corruption bugs in ASN.1 related components of an LTE stack have been announced or hinted at in several infosec conference presentations over the past few weeks and its likely the same or similar bugs will become public soon. 2. Objective Systems has already produced a fix that is available upon request to all its customers. It does not seem reasonable to impose a 2 month publication delay on every other vendor. Asked CERT/CC: 1. Did other vendors request to postpone publication or indicated they were or were not vulnerable? 2. Did CERT/CC disseminate the information to any other parties?
* **2016-07-01:**
  CERT/CC indicated they've contacted as many vendors as possible, US-CERT and international CERT partners and that only one vendor has requested to delay publication so far. Agreed that proceeding with the original publication schedule is reasonable given the partial disclosure due to dissemination that already occurred plus the fact that a fix is availble
* **2016-07-01:**
  Programa STIC sent mail to CERT/CC saying that for the moment it will proceed with the original deadline but make a final decision on July 5.
* **2016-07-06:**
  Programa STIC sent email to CERT/CC indicating it decided to postpone publication for a week to give vendors some adiditional time to assess whether they are vulnerable and plan for issuing fixes. The new publication date was set to July 13.
* **2016-07-06:**
  CERT/CC replied that it will notify vendors of the new puublicaiton date.
* **2016-07-13:**
  CERT/CC asked if the security advisory was published and requested an URL for it.
* **2016-07-14:**
  Programa STIC told CERT/CC that publication was postponed to Monday, July 18.
* **2016-07-13:**
  Programa STIC sent mail to Objective Systems Inc. notifiying them that the security advisory will be published on July 18.
* **2016-07-13:**
  Objective Systems Inc. asked if a CVE ID has been assigned to the issue.
* **2016-07-13:**
