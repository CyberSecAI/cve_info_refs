Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the bidirectional-text implementation in Google Chrome handles URLs, specifically in the omnibox (address bar). It does not ensure that URLs are always rendered left-to-right (LTR). By using right-to-left (RTL) Unicode characters within a URL, attackers can cause the address bar to display a misleading or spoofed URL. The rendering issue was specific to the android version of chrome in the *SuggestionView.java* and *UrlBar.java*

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can craft a URL containing RTL characters that, when displayed in the address bar, will appear to be a different, legitimate URL.
*   **Improper Unicode Handling:** The browser fails to force LTR rendering for URLs, allowing RTL Unicode characters to influence the overall display direction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to make malicious websites appear legitimate, tricking users into entering sensitive information.
*   **User Deception:** Users could be misled into believing they are visiting a safe site when in fact, they are on a malicious one, potentially leading to other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector involves creating malicious URLs that contain RTL Unicode characters strategically placed to make the URL look like a different, trusted one.
*   **Web Pages:** These URLs could be embedded in web pages via links or redirects that the victim may click.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create crafted URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with specific RTL characters.
*   **Ability to deliver the URL:**  The attacker needs a way to get users to load this crafted URL. This could be via email, social media, malicious websites, or any other means of distribution.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to manually navigate to the malicious URL or click a link containing the malicious URL to be affected by this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 53.0.2785.89 and 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
*   The fix involved forcing the paragraph direction to LTR in the omnibox, ensuring URLs are displayed consistently from left to right, while still allowing RTL characters to be rendered as RTL when present in the URL.
*   The vulnerability was also present in the android version of chrome, and the code was fixed in both *UrlBar.java* and *SuggestionView.java*.
