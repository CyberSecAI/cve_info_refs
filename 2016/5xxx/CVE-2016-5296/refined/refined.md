{
  "CVE-2016-5296": {
    "description": "A heap-buffer-overflow in Cairo when processing SVG content caused by compiler optimization, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a signed integer overflow in the `rasterize_edges_1` function within the Cairo graphics library, specifically in how it handles calculations related to edge rasterization. Compiler optimizations were causing a failure to correctly clamp potentially negative values due to integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
       "Integer overflow",
        "Failure to sanitize input"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a denial-of-service condition. The heap-buffer-overflow allows for arbitrary memory writes.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious SVG file that triggers the vulnerable code path within Cairo, a remote attacker can exploit the heap-buffer-overflow.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to have a target application process a malicious SVG image. This could be achieved through visiting a malicious website, opening a malicious email or attachment, or other means of content injection."
