Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5422:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper authorization in Red Hat JBoss Operations Network (JON). Specifically, regular (non-administrative) users were able to add a new super user by sending a specially crafted POST request to the JON web console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The JON web console did not properly restrict access to the user creation functionality, allowing unprivileged users to perform administrative tasks. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The crafted POST request was not properly validated, allowing it to bypass access controls and perform unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A regular user could elevate their privileges to that of a super user/administrator.
*   **Compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  With superuser access, an attacker could gain full control of the JON server and the resources it manages. This includes:
    *   Accessing sensitive data (Confidentiality).
    *   Modifying system configurations and data (Integrity).
    *   Disrupting services and causing denial-of-service (Availability).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is executed over the network by sending a crafted POST request to the JON web console.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the JON web console.
*   **Valid User Account:** While the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation, the attacker initially requires a valid user account with basic permissions on the JON system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in JBoss Operations Network version 3.3.7 (RHSA-2016:1785), which was a security and bug fix update.
*   The issue was discovered by Jeremy Choi from the Red Hat Product Security Team.
*   The fix involved restricting access to the user creation functionality to only authorized users.
*   The Red Hat security advisory rated this update as having a security impact of **Moderate**.
