Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-5819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to properly neutralize user-supplied input during web page generation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into a user's browser through a web page, leveraging the trust relationship between the user's browser and the server. This is a type of input validation failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary script code within the user's browser. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform malicious actions within the userâ€™s session. The confidentiality and integrity could be affected due to unauthorized access or modifications of information. 

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (remote) and does not require any user interaction (no UI required). An attacker can send crafted requests to the affected application in an attempt to inject code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges to carry out this attack. They just need to be able to send network requests to the target.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2016-5819 and provides a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5.
- The affected products are Moxa OnCell G3100V2 Series (prior to version 2.8) and OnCell G3111/G3151/G3211/G3251 Series (prior to version 1.7).
- Moxa has released firmware updates to address the vulnerability.
- The advisory also provides general mitigation advice, like minimizing network exposure of control systems, and using firewalls and VPNs.
