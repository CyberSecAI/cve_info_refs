RELEVANT

Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in `mcrypt_generic` and `mdecrypt_generic` when calculating data size. This occurs because the `data_size` variable is a signed integer, leading to a heap overflow when a large length value is supplied.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
  - Integer overflow leading to heap overflow.
  - Use after free
  - Double free
  - Out-of-bounds read
  - Null pointer dereference
  - Stack buffer overflow

Impact of exploitation:
  - Denial of service (application crash).
  - Arbitrary code execution (in some cases).
  - Information disclosure.

Attack vectors:
  - Crafted length values passed to `mcrypt_generic` and `mdecrypt_generic` functions.
  - Maliciously crafted XML data to trigger double free in `wddx_deserialize`.
  - Processing crafted image file using GD library functions.
  - Crafted HTTP header with Transfer-Encoding set to chunked.
  - Malicious LDAP server response.
  - Unserialize() with special crafted data.
  - Crafted password for password\_verify.
  - Maliciously crafted ZIP, TAR, and PHAR archives.
  - Exploiting recursion in multiple functions.
  - Crafted POST data with large content length values.
  - Exploiting crafted urls with special characters.
  - Exploiting specially crafted locale strings to trigger crashes in Intl
    functions.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to send a crafted payload to the vulnerable application/function.
  - Ability to connect and interact with a vulnerable service using a crafted message.
  - Ability to upload specially crafted files (e.g. images, phar archives, XML data).
  - Ability to set specific environment variables.

Additional Details:
 - Many of the issues are related to integer overflows leading to heap corruption, stack buffer overflows, or use after frees
 - The vulnerable code exists within multiple extensions like mcrypt, gd, mbstring, wddx, etc.
 - Some vulnerabilities also involve double frees or out-of-bounds reads/writes
 - Some issues are specific to certain SAPIs (e.g. CGI, FastCGI, PHP-FPM)
 - Some issues are Windows or Big-Endian specific
 -  The fixes for these vulnerabilities involve proper input validation, size checks, and improved memory handling.
 - Many of the fixes also added protections against null byte injection or other character-related injection vulnerabilities.
