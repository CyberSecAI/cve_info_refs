Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Puppet Agent's Puppet Execution Protocol (PXP) command whitelist validation had a flaw. This allowed bypassing the intended restrictions on commands that could be executed via PXP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Command Whitelist Validation:** The core issue was that the command whitelist, designed to prevent arbitrary commands, could be circumvented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By bypassing the command whitelist, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on Puppet Agent nodes. This is especially critical in Puppet Enterprise environments prior to version 2016.4.0.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Though not explicitly stated, the advisory mentions obtaining sensitive information as a potential impact, likely a consequence of arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PXP (Puppet Execution Protocol):** The vulnerability is specifically related to how Puppet Agent handles commands received through the PXP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Puppet Agent nodes to send malicious commands via PXP.
*   **PXP Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the PXP interface of the vulnerable Puppet Agent.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was considered high risk on its own, but when combined with a separate PCP Broker vulnerability, it becomes a critical security issue.
*   The vulnerability affects Puppet Enterprise versions prior to 2016.4.0 and Puppet Agent versions 1.3.6 - 1.7.0.
*   Default configurations of the FOSS Puppet Agent are not vulnerable.
*   The fix was implemented in Puppet Agent version 1.7.1 and Puppet Enterprise 2016.4.0.
*   Gentoo's GLSA 201710-12 addresses the issue by upgrading `app-admin/puppet-agent` to at least version 1.7.1

**Summary of Findings**

The provided content relates to CVE-2016-5714 and gives further detail about the specific vulnerability. It highlights that the vulnerability resides in how Puppet Agent handled commands through the Puppet Execution Protocol (PXP), allowing a bypass of the command whitelist and potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
