Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-5824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `libical` library. This occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory location is still being used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. This means that a memory region is freed but then accessed later.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crafted ics file can trigger the use-after-free, leading to a crash, which causes a denial of service.
- **Potential for other exploitation:** The content mentions that this vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, although the primary demonstrated impact is a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted ICS File:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted ICS file that, when parsed by libical, triggers the use-after-free condition.
- **Remote Attack:** Remote attackers can exploit this via specially crafted ics files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to deliver a malicious ICS file:** An attacker needs the ability to get a vulnerable application to parse their malicious ICS file. This might involve tricking a user into opening a malicious attachment, for example.
- **No privileged access needed:** It seems no prior privileged access is required, as the vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted file.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was present in `libical` versions prior to 3.0.0.
- The vulnerability affects multiple products that use `libical` including, Mozilla Thunderbird and applications using the libical library.
- Red Hat and Debian provided security advisories to address this issue, and Ubuntu addressed this as part of a larger security update.
- The vulnerability is triggered during parsing of ICS files.
- The vulnerability stems from improper memory management within the `libical` library.
