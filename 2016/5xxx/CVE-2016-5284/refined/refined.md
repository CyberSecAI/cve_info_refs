  "CVE-2016-5284": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2016-5284",
      "Description": "Mozilla Firefox before 49.0, Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.4, and Thunderbird < 45.4 rely on unintended expiration dates for Preloaded Public Key Pinning, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof add-on updates by leveraging possession of an X.509 server certificate for addons.mozilla.org signed by an arbitrary built-in Certification Authority."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of Preloaded Public Key Pinning (HPKP) in Mozilla Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird. The expiration dates for the preloaded pins were not being updated correctly, leading to a period where pinning became ineffective.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
	"certificate pinning bypass"
      ],
      "Impact": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker with a mis-issued certificate for addons.mozilla.org could send malicious add-on updates to users on controlled networks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": [
        "Ability to perform MITM attacks",
        "Possession of a valid or spoofed X.509 server certificate for addons.mozilla.org, signed by a built-in CA"
      ],
       "Affected Products":[
         "Mozilla Firefox",
         "Mozilla Firefox ESR",
         "Mozilla Thunderbird",
	"Tor Browser"
	]
    }
