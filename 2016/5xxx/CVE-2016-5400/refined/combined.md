media: fix airspy usb probe error pathFix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.
The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
v4l2 of type VFL\_TYPE\_SDR or VFL\_TYPE\_SUBDEV.
The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.
A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
vulnerability.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3070-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A

local user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an

ACL. ([CVE-2016-1237](/security/CVE-2016-1237))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets

(RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-5244](/security/CVE-2016-5244))

James Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2016-5400](/security/CVE-2016-5400))

Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation's handling of

challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP

stream. ([CVE-2016-5696](/security/CVE-2016-5696))

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-5728](/security/CVE-2016-5728))

Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled

transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-5828](/security/CVE-2016-5828))

It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-5829](/security/CVE-2016-5829))

It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename

operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-6197](/security/CVE-2016-6197))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3070-2: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerabilities

30 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A

local user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an

ACL. ([CVE-2016-1237](/security/CVE-2016-1237))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets

(RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-5244](/security/CVE-2016-5244))

James Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2016-5400](/security/CVE-2016-5400))

Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation's handling of

challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP

stream. ([CVE-2016-5696](/security/CVE-2016-5696))

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-5728](/security/CVE-2016-5728))

Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled

transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-5828](/security/CVE-2016-5828))

It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-5829](/security/CVE-2016-5829))

It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename

operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-6197](/security/CVE-2016-6197))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1021-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.4.0-1021.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1021.27)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

media: fix airspy usb probe error path

Fix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.

The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.

The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.

A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
vulnerability.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A

local user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an

ACL. ([CVE-2016-1237](/security/CVE-2016-1237))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets

(RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-5244](/security/CVE-2016-5244))

James Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2016-5400](/security/CVE-2016-5400))

Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation's handling of

challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP

stream. ([CVE-2016-5696](/security/CVE-2016-5696))

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-5728](/security/CVE-2016-5728))

Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled

transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-5828](/security/CVE-2016-5828))

It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-5829](/security/CVE-2016-5829))

It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename

operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-6197](/security/CVE-2016-6197))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-36.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-36.55)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-36-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-36.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-36.55)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-36-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-36.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-36.55)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-36.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-36.55)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-36.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-36.55)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-36.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-36.55)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-36.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-36.55)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Subject: CVE-2016-5400 - linux kernel: denial of service in airspy USB driver.

Hello All,

A flaw was found in the linux kernel's implementation of the airspy
USB device driver in which a leak was found when a subdev or SDR are
plugged into the host.

An attacker can create an targeted USB device which can emulate 64 of
these devices. Then by emulating an additional device which
continuously connects and disconnects, each connection attempt will
leak memory which can not be recovered.

This issue was assigned CVE-2016-5400.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon Processors

## Details

A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A

local user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an

ACL. ([CVE-2016-1237](/security/CVE-2016-1237))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets

(RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-5244](/security/CVE-2016-5244))

James Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

consumption). ([CVE-2016-5400](/security/CVE-2016-5400))

Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation's handling of

challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP

stream. ([CVE-2016-5696](/security/CVE-2016-5696))

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-5728](/security/CVE-2016-5728))

Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled

transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-5828](/security/CVE-2016-5828))

It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-5829](/security/CVE-2016-5829))

It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename

operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-6197](/security/CVE-2016-6197))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1024-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon)
  -
  [4.4.0-1024.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1024.27)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1358184#c0)  Wade Mealing    2016-07-20 09:20:43 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the linux kernel's implementation of the airspy USB device driver in which a leak was found when a subdev or SDR are plugged into the host.  An attacker can create an targeted USB device which can emulate 64 of these devices. Then by emulating an additional device which continuously connects and disconnects, each connection attempt will leak memory which can not be recovered.  Upstream patch: <https://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git/commit/?id=eca2d34b9d2ce70165a50510659838e28ca22742>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1358184#c1)  Wade Mealing    2016-07-20 09:21:37 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1358186](show_bug.cgi?id=1358186 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5400 kernel: memory leak in airspy usb driver [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1358184#c2)  Wade Mealing    2016-07-20 09:27:43 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected by this flaw as this module is not available in shipping source code.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1358184#c3)  Wade Mealing    2016-07-20 09:31:31 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank James Patrick-Evans for bringing this to our attention.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1358184#c5)  Justin M. Forbes    2016-07-20 14:52:24 UTC  ``` Is there a fix posted anywhere? LKML wasn't copied it seems, and the mitre listing is still the default reserved text.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1358184#c6)  Wade Mealing    2016-07-25 00:45:51 UTC  ``` Gday Justin,  At this time, the patch has been submitted to the maintainer ( <https://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git/commit/?id=eca2d34b9d2ce70165a50510659838e28ca22742> ) and we are awaiting the submission upstream.  Thanks  Wade Mealing Red Hat Product Security   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1358184#c7)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-28 07:38:51 UTC  ``` Is that patch really related to this issue?
