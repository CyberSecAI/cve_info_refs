Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5400:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory leak in the `airspy_probe` function of the airspy USB device driver in the Linux kernel. The driver doesn't properly free allocated resources when it fails to register a device with the v4l2 core.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory leak:**  The `airspy_probe` function fails to free allocated memory for control structures when an error occurs during device registration. This leads to memory exhaustion over time.
- **Improper error handling:** The driver doesn't correctly handle errors that occur during the v4l2 device registration process, specifically when a video device fails to register it does not free memory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a local denial of service by exhausting system memory.
- **System crash:** Repeated connection and disconnection attempts of emulated devices cause the kernel to run out of RAM, leading to a system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Physical access:**  An attacker requires physical access to the target system to connect a malicious USB device.
- **Malicious USB device:** The attacker uses a specially crafted USB device that emulates multiple VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Physical access to the target system:** The attacker must be able to connect a malicious USB device to the system.
- **Ability to emulate USB devices:** The attacker needs a USB device capable of emulating multiple VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV devices.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability to exploit it.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when more than 64 USB devices register with v4l2 of type `VFL_TYPE_SDR` or `VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV`.
- A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel.
- The fix involves correcting the error handling in the `airspy_probe` function to free the allocated control structures even when the device registration fails.

This detailed analysis provides more information than the original CVE description, clarifying the specific flaw, the attack vector, and its impact.
