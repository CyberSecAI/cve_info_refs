  "CVE-2016-5406": {
    "description": "The domain controller will not propagate its administrative RBAC configuration to some slaves. An attacker could use this to escalate their privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The domain controller fails to propagate its administrative Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration to some slave nodes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete RBAC propagation",
      "Privilege escalation vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative privileges on the slave nodes and the servers they manage.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker can manage a domain that includes earlier version slaves and exploit the missing RBAC configuration"
