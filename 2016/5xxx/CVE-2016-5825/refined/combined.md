Steps to reproduce:
Creating a small test harness passing a given input to the icalparser\_parse\_string function, I found the attached testcase causes a heap overread in icaltime\_from\_string. This was tested against latest libical and 0.47 from Thunderbird.
Code calling icalparser\_parse\_string can be found here: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/search?q=icalparser_parse_string>

In the meantime, to provide more testcases for this bug that may take different paths through thunderbird in order to reach the vulnerable function (if indeed there is prior sanity checking that I haven't seen/found), perhaps these testcases will be useful for better reproing with an ASan-compiled version of thunderbird.

This is a "low" rated security issue so does not qualify for bounty and we have not seen verification that this directly affects Thunderbird. As a result, we are minusing this for bounty.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty-

While importing the caltime.ics (attached) file from the "Events and Tasks" menu option in Thunderbird 45 running on Fedora 24 under Valgrind, I see,

Extension "{e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103}" is Lightning. So upstream Thunderbird seems to be affected by this CVE.

I'm pretty sure this was fixed in the libical 3.0 branch a long time ago.

if someone feels like trying a modern version, please use libical 3.0.8.

I am the libical maintainer and would like to know it it still happens.

Attached file
[get\_char\_test.ics](attachment.cgi?id=8763671)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8763671&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Creating a small test harness passing a given input to icalparser\_parse\_string, I was able to find the attached input causes a heap overread in parser\_get\_next\_char. This was tested against libical 0.47 from Thunderbird and libical latest.
Unfortunately, I am unable to compile Thunderbird with ASan support in order to give a better idea of affected code paths. The affected code calling icalparser\_parse\_string can be found at: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/search?q=icalparser_parse_string>
Actual results:
The ASan results are below

Nominating for a bounty, but this doesn't have any symptoms in a release Thunderbird so it's hard to see where the exploit would be.Flags: sec-bounty?

In the meantime, to provide more testcases for this bug that may take different paths through thunderbird in order to reach the vulnerable function (if indeed there is prior sanity checking that I haven't seen/found), perhaps these testcases will be useful for better reproing with an ASan-compiled version of thunderbird.

This is a "low" rated security issue so does not qualify for bounty and we have not seen verification that this directly affects Thunderbird. As a result, we are minusing this for bounty.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty-

MITRE has no role in determining the list charter, but
<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security> says
"List Content Guidelines ... Any security issues that you post to
oss-security should be either already public or to be made public by
your posting." Because you apparently are publishing both the
research methodology (i.e., AddressSanitizer) and the types of
findings, this is close to a public disclosure but may be outside
the spirit of the list. (We definitely would not have responded here
if the one fully described case, segv.ics.bug, had been omitted.)

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Not much so far.
Also, starting around summer last year(?), I could not build ASAN-build any more: I am not sure if it was GCC change (I used 5.x instead of GCC 4.y), the local library changes of various libraries, or binutils tool chain such as gnu gold linker, etc.
Maybe if someone can create a calendar event message with screwed up Date line as in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1280832#c0 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Heap buffer overread in libical (icalparser_parse_string function)"), I can test one.

That's what I am looking at it as, but need someone better in-tune with the codebase to confirm.

You mention that you could not build an ASAN build of TB.
Did you get a link-time error?
(I think I got one: before that happened, I certainly could build one earlier last year.)

I did not dig too much into it. The line below will build Thunderbird + calendar successfully.
export CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="" CXXFLAGS="" LDFLAGS=""; make -f client.mk
This one fails to build, and I am not sure why at this point.
export CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" CXXFLAGS="" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"; make -f client.mk

Hi,
You might want to check
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1272498#c6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1272498#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Compiling with GCC and Address Sanitizer is broken: \"error: expected unqualified-id before string constant\"")
use the patch there to see if you can build an ASAN-build of TB.
I could build one locally using GCC-5.
Using that I tried to tinker with calendar event sent by MS OFFICE (saving it and then
editing by an editor to change the
entries, etc.) but no luck crashing TB.
Maybe before ical library is called some sanity check is done at higher level?

These errors may crash TB, but they may not. I only get clear reproductions of the crash with ASan. There may be some checking that I am unaware of. Like I said, I need someone with better familiarity with the code base to make a better statement of vulnerability.

Didn't crash a stock Thunderbird (Mac). Not sure if it's not reachable in Thunderbird, or if the particular overread simple doesn't trigger an access violation. Even if it could be triggered in Thunderbird, if there's no scripting it would seem hard to exploit: random memory could be read into a calendar event, which shows up on the user's calendar (if the rest of it isn't too corrupted to get that far), but how does it get back to the attacker? If it doesn't it's not very useful as an exploit.

Does it have to make it back to an attacker to be considered a security vulnerability? Many times, heap over reads are used in conjunction with other vulns in order to achieve more than the sum of the parts.

For instance, Jon Oberheide's half-nelson exploit from 2010 is a great example of this, even though he takes advantage of uninitialized memory as opposed to a heap overread, the end effect is the same that potentially sensitive memory can be leaked/disclosed. Each of these bugs in and of themselves are 'not very useful as an exploit'.

I get the following with C-C TB under linux. (This is a debug build created locally. I also ran it using ASAN-enabled TB.).
Error: [calICSService] Exception parsing item: ReferenceError: data is not defined
Error: Error Parsing ICS: 2147500037
It seems that lightening seems to check data at the upper level somewhat, but
as was pointed out, we should wait.
At the same time, I think I would file RFE (Request for Enhancement) about TB's behavior.
It seems
- TB asks the users if s/he wants to add an event to the calendar if an e-mail with calendar event is received (in my case POP3 account).
- TB does NOT ASK anything and automatically adds the event to one's calendar if
we open an ics file [File] -> [Open] -> calendar
This is rather bad. We can import broken/unwanted event into the calendar without the
chance to inspect its content. E.g., we may never realize that the bad calendar event may try to use up a whole month six months head, for example, etc.

Hey Chiaki,
The patch may work, but in Thunderbird 38 (the version in the ubuntu repos and what I am currently set up to build in my dev VM) the patch doesn't work (no surprise though). I am also unable to locate the code where you would supposedly patch it in, and no mention of MOZ\_ASAN can be found in the release tarball of Thunderbird 38.
I will work on getting a system set up with all of the deps required to build the bleeding edge code.

Oh, I did not realize that you are working on ESR38 source tree.
Sorry for the confusion.

Well, I have been building C-C source tree irrespective of the current widely used version for quite some time and so have lost touch with how the source/document are
distributed for the ESR version.
Usually, there is a tarball for the released version, but now that you mention it,
I am not entirely sure if ESR38 source code is ready for instrumentation with address sanitizer.
> I will work on getting a system set up with all of the deps required to

Good luck. Preparing C-C source tree for building is NOT THAT difficult.
Well, there may be a few quirks. (GCC 5.x seems to generate a buggy binary OR
it changes the timing of various threads to the point that the
ASAN-enabled version of C-C TB segfaults due to MOZ\_ASSERT that says
getStringBundle methods are not thread-safe (!?).
Also, with GCC 6.x, you need to pass additional compiler flag
-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks
so that C-C TB does not crash at all.
I am using Oracle VirtualBox which runs 64-bit Debian GNU/Linux 64-bit distribution as guest OS under Windows 10 host.
I compile and test C-C TB within this guest linux OS, and the environment works just fine.

In the meantime, to provide more testcases for this bug that may take different paths through thunderbird in order to reach the vulnerable function (if indeed there is prior sanity checking that I haven't seen/found), perhaps these testcases will be useful for better reproing with an ASan-compiled version of thunderbird.

FWIW, Thunderbird 38 is irrelevant as that's obsolete at this point. We already released 45 ESR, and the 38 series won't get any more updates.

When I looked into how I should begin repro'ing issues I found in libical, I looked at the commits to libical in Thunderbird between the version available in Ubuntu and the latest snapshot. The number of commits to libical in the timeframe (only a handful that I could see) gave me the impression that libical in ESR 38 was essentially the same as libical in the current version. If anyone disagrees with this, however, I am willing to reconsider.

How exactly should an ASan build be performed on a source release tarball? I have found documentation
I have tried every possible way I can think of, but I cannot actually compile Thunderbird+Calendar with ASan. In some parts, LDFLAGS does not seem to be respected at all, which causes a library compilation to succeed, but the linking to fail.
I have tried by using the client.mk Makefile directly, by specifying the environment variables. Fails as described above.
I have tried directly modifying the moz.build files for the libraries I intend on compiling with ASan support. Again, LDFLAGS even specified in moz.build files seem to not be respected everywhere.
I have tried using the mozconfig approach, the following mozconfig and many permutations of it which all fail in slightly different areas due to linking failing to find the \_\_asan methods.
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++
ac\_add\_options --disable-gstreamer
ac\_add\_options --enable-application=mail
ac\_add\_options --enable-calendar
ac\_add\_options --enable-jemalloc
ac\_add\_options --enable-replace-malloc
ac\_add\_options --with-system-harfbuzz
ac\_add\_options --disable-glibtest
ac\_add\_options --disable-gtktest
ac\_add\_options --disable-tests
ac\_add\_options --disable-freetypetest

ac\_add\_options --disable-ffmpeg
ac\_add\_options --disable-fmp4
ac\_add\_options --disable-wave
ac\_add\_options --enable-address-sanitizer
ac\_add\_options --disable-crashreporter
I am at a complete loss as to how to get a better, more relevant stack trace (or to disprove my suspicion that Thunderbird is vulnerable). Any thoughts are appreciated. I am testing with Clang 3.6 for what that's worth. I have downloaded and also been working with the latest Thunderbird 45.1.1 release tarball.

Hi, I could create C-C TB with the following approach.
Define -fsanitize=address in your environmental variables:
CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.
GCC under Debian GNU/Linux.
... snip from my shell script ...
ASAN=-fsanitize=address
# ASAN=
#
#
#
#
# -fPIC -mcmodel=large caused cpuid() asm definition in
# mozilla/media/libvpx/vpx\_ports/x86.h to blow up.
#
# see the discussion in <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-12/msg01484.html>
# But I don't understand the GCC in-line asm of late.
#
MEMORYMODEL="-fPIC -mcmodel=large"
MEMORYMODEL="-mcmodel=large"
MEMORYMODEL=
export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $MEMORYMODEL $ASAN -fno-builtin-strlen $SPLITDWARF -Dfdatasync=fdatasync -DDEBUG\_4GB\_CHECK -DUSEHELGRIND=1"
export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $MEMORYMODEL $ASAN -fno-builtin-strlen $SPLITDWARF -Dfdatasync=fdatasync -DDEBUG\_4GB\_CHECK -DUSEHELGRIND=1"
export CC="/usr/bin/gcc-6"
export CXX="/usr/bin/g++-6"
before invokcing
make -f client.mk
Possibly redundant but I also define -fsanitaize=address again
in mozconfig for ASAN build:
-dl for LDFLAGS was necessary to link ASAN with GCC.
-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks is necessary for GCC6 with C-C TB.
#
# Mandatory flags for ASan
export ASANFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -Dxmalloc=myxmalloc -fPIC"
export CFLAGS="$ASANFLAGS $CFLAGS -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"
export CXXFLAGS="$ASANFLAGS $CXXFLAGS -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"
export LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -ldl"
# Enable ASan specific code and build workarounds
ac\_add\_options --enable-address-sanitizer
# Mandatory options required for ASan builds (both on Linux and Mac)
export MOZ\_DEBUG\_SYMBOLS=1
# ac\_add\_options --enable-debug-symbols # already defined with -gsplit-dwarf
ac\_add\_options --disable-install-strip
ac\_add\_options --disable-jemalloc
ac\_add\_options --disable-crashreporter
ac\_add\_options --disable-elf-hack
# Avoid dependency on libstdc++ 4.7
# ac\_add\_options --enable-stdcxx-compat
...
Some --disable-\* are from the instruction for FF build with ASAN.
Hope this helps.

You don't have to disable gmp-plugin, gmp-plugin-openh264 from the mozilla/dom/media/moz.build?
With those exact settings on ESR38, ESR45, and latest comm-central, I have to manually edit out the gmp-plugin and gmp-plugin-openh264 in the moz.build. They fail to build when asan is enabled.
I also have to edit the ldap/moz.build to not build the c-sdk because this also fails to build with asan.
Once those are edited out, libnspr4.so fails to build with asan:

I also exported your CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS that you mentioned.
I am assuming C-C Thunderbird is comm-central? Are you building a particular branch? What is the current hg commit that these build instructions work for you?

From the last question first:
C-C thunderbird means comm-central.
I never had to tweak moz.config (I \*THINK\*) directly.
I have no idea what gmp-plugin, gmp-plugin-openh264 are.

That said, what linker are you using?
I would suggest try GNU gold linker from binutils.
Mine is
ld --version
GNU gold (GNU Binutils for Debian 2.26) 1.11
...
Under debian, it is /usr/bin/ld.gold (which is a link to architecture specific binary).
(I would not recommend
ac\_add\_options --enable-debug-symbols=-gsplit-dwarf
in my mozconfig-tb3 unless you are using gnu gold linker.)
Basically, with the above mozconifg
I run
make -f client.mk configure;
make -f client.mk

This is a "low" rated security issue so does not qualify for bounty and we have not seen verification that this directly affects Thunderbird. As a result, we are minusing this for bounty.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty-

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
