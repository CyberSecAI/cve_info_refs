- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An information disclosure vulnerability is present in VMware Fusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for information disclosure, specifically the exposure of kernel memory addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this issue may allow a privileged local user on a system where System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled, to obtain kernel memory addresses to bypass the kASLR protection mechanism. This could potentially lead to further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring a privileged user account on the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a privileged local user account on a system where VMware Fusion is running and SIP is enabled.
