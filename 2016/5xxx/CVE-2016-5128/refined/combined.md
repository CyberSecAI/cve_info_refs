Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/07/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, July 20, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 52 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 52.0.2743.82 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/51.0.2704.106..52.0.2743.82?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 52.
#### Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [48 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M52). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[629852](https://crbug.com/629852)] CVE-2016-1705: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

# USN-3041-1: Oxide vulnerabilities

5 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1705](/security/CVE-2016-1705))

It was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the

origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms.

([CVE-2016-1706](/security/CVE-2016-1706))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a

deferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass

same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1710](/security/CVE-2016-1710))

It was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a

detach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1711](/security/CVE-2016-1711))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5127](/security/CVE-2016-5127))

It was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors

from modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5128](/security/CVE-2016-5128))

A memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5129](/security/CVE-2016-5129))

A security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL.

([CVE-2016-5130](/security/CVE-2016-5130))

A use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5131](/security/CVE-2016-5131))

The Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement

the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to

control a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5132](/security/CVE-2016-5132))

It was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy

authentication. A machine-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this

to spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. ([CVE-2016-5133](/security/CVE-2016-5133))

It was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium

does not ensure that URL information is restricted to a scheme, host and

port. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2016-5134](/security/CVE-2016-5134))

It was discovered that Blink does not consider referrer-policy information

inside an HTML document during a preload request. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP)

protections. ([CVE-2016-5135](/security/CVE-2016-5135))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in

Blink does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether a specific

HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-5137](/security/CVE-2016-5137))
