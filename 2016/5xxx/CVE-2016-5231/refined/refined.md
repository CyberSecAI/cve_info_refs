- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Huawei smart phones, allowing an attacker to bypass permission checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Authentication bypass, leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain elevated privileges and delete partial user data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must trick the user into installing a malicious application. The malicious application then leverages the vulnerability to bypass permission checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to develop and distribute a malicious application and trick the user into installing it on their device.
