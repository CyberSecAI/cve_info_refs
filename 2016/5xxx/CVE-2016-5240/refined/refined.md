  "CVE-2016-5240": {
    "Description": "Gustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "An endless loop caused by negative stroke-dasharray arguments when parsing SVG files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability due to a lack of validation of stroke-dasharray arguments."
    ],
     "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS).",
     "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted SVG file with negative stroke-dasharray arguments, processed by GraphicsMagick, triggers the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft an SVG file with negative stroke-dasharray arguments and convince a user or application to process it with GraphicsMagick."
