These issues are now resolved in the GraphicsMagick Mercurial
repository.

It is worth noting that ImageMagick's built-in SVG renderer has the
same problem with "circular.svg" (specify the input file name like
"msvg:circular.svg").

Debian Bug     : 814732 825800 847055

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a
collection of image processing tool, which can cause denial of service
attacks, remote file deletion, and remote command execution.

This security update removes the full support of PLT/Gnuplot decoder to
prevent Gnuplot-shell based shell exploits for fixing the CVE-2016-3714
vulnerability.

The undocumented "TMP" magick prefix no longer removes the argument file
after it has been read for fixing the CVE-2016-3715 vulnerability. Since
the "TMP" feature was originally implemented, GraphicsMagick added a
temporary file management subsystem which assures that temporary files
are removed so this feature is not needed.

Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output
to a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the
command) with a '|' for fixing the CVE-2016-5118 vulnerability.

CVE-2015-8808

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an out of bound read in the parsing of GIF
    files which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2317

    Gustavo Grieco discovered a stack buffer overflow and two heap buffer
    overflows while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2318

    Gustavo Grieco discovered several segmentation faults while processing
    SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-5240

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative
    stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause
    denial of service.

CVE-2016-7800

    Marco Grassi discovered an unsigned underflow leading to heap overflow
    when parsing 8BIM chunk often attached to JPG files which may cause
    denial of service.

CVE-2016-7996

    Moshe Kaplan discovered that there is no check that the provided
    colormap is not larger than 256 entries in the WPG reader which may
    cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-7997

    Moshe Kaplan discovered that an assertion is thrown for some files in
    the WPG reader due to a logic error which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8682

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a stack buffer read overflow
    while reading the SCT header which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8683

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
    PCX coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8684

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
    SGI coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-9830

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in
    MagickRealloc() function which may cause denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.20-3+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems (with the
exception of CVE-2016-9830) have been fixed in version 1.3.25-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.25-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> We recently tested GraphicsMagick with our tool and found two issues that
> causes DoS:

> * Infinite loop caused by converting a circularly defined svg file.

Use CVE-2016-5240.

>> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/05/01/6>

>> It is worth noting that ImageMagick's built-in SVG renderer has the
>> same problem with "circular.svg" (specify the input file name like
>> "msvg:circular.svg").

We feel that this ImageMagick issue is also within the scope of the
CVE-2016-5240 ID.

> * Arithmetic exception converting a svg file caused by a X%0 operation in
> magick/render.c:3800
>
>     (long) (y-fill_pattern->tile_info.y) % fill_pattern->rows,

Use CVE-2016-5241.

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: ImageMagick security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1237)

## Topic

An update for ImageMagick is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 18 July 2016]
This advisory has been updated to push packages into the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Desktop channels. The packages included in this revised update have not been changed in any way from the packages included in the original advisory.

## Description

ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System that can read and write multiple image formats.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that ImageMagick did not properly sanitize certain input before using it to invoke processes. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted image that, when processed by an application using ImageMagick or an unsuspecting user using the ImageMagick utilities, would lead to arbitrary execution of shell commands with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-5118)
* It was discovered that ImageMagick did not properly sanitize certain input before passing it to the gnuplot delegate functionality. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted image that, when processed by an application using ImageMagick or an unsuspecting user using the ImageMagick utilities, would lead to arbitrary execution of shell commands with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-5239)
* Multiple flaws have been discovered in ImageMagick. A remote attacker could, for example, create specially crafted images that, when processed by an application using ImageMagick or an unsuspecting user using the ImageMagick utilities, would result in a memory corruption and, potentially, execution of arbitrary code, a denial of service, or an application crash. (CVE-2015-8896, CVE-2015-8895, CVE-2016-5240, CVE-2015-8897, CVE-2015-8898)

Subject: CVE request: DoS in multiple versions of GraphicsMagick

We recently tested GraphicsMagick with our tool and found two issues that
causes DoS:

* Infinite loop caused by converting a circularly defined svg file.

* Arithmetic exception converting a svg file caused by a X%0 operation in
magick/render.c:3800

    (long) (y-fill_pattern->tile_info.y) % fill_pattern->rows,

Reproducers for both issues are attached. They are triggered by converting
a svg to another format. Identification is not affected.
These issues affect 1.3.18 and 1.3.23. Most likely other versions are
vulnerable too.

Regards,
Gustavo

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1334188#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-09 06:53:22 UTC  ``` It was found that gnuplot delegate functionality in ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick allows system command injection while interpreting gnuplot files.  Upstream patch (ImageMagick):  <http://git.imagemagick.org/repos/ImageMagick/commit/70a2cf326ed32bedee144b961005>  Upstream patch (GraphicsMagick):  <http://hg.code.sf.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/rev/45998a25992d>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1334188#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-23 14:08:15 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/05/09/1>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1334188#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-16 22:48:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:1237 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1237](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1237)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1334188#c7)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-08-11 11:03:04 UTC  ``` To clear things up a bit:  * gnuplot files should not be processed when coming from an untrusted source, as they can contain dangerous commands. * ImageMagick does not care. If it detects a gnuplot file, it tries to delegate it to gnuplot.  If gnuplot is not installed or ImageMagick can't launch gnuplot, there should be no issue.  RHEL5 specific: The gnuplot delegation in RHEL5 is broken due to an unrelated issue. ImageMagick fails to launch gnuplot correctly, thus preventing this attack vector.   ``` |  |

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# GraphicsMagick ChangeLog - 2016

2016-12-31 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/pnm.c (WritePNMImage): Support writing GRAYSCALE PAM
>   format. Before this fix, grayscale output was marked as type
>   BLACKANDWHITE. Problem was reported by Aaron Boxer via email on
>   December 31, 2016.
> * TclMagick/generic/Makefile.am: Applied patch by Massimo Manghi
>   (plus some fixes by me) to add a 'libttkcommon' shared library to
>   contain codde common to the TclMagick/TkMagick loadable modules,
>   and particularly to allow TkMagick to access TclMagick functions
>   without depending on dlopen() with RTLD\_GLOBAL behavior.

2016-12-24 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * magick/compare.c (DifferenceImage): Fix all-black difference
>   image if an input file is colormapped. Resolves SourceForge issue
>   #404 "Difference file does not work if PNG ".

2016-12-23 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/txt.c (ReadTXTImage): Fix Coverity issue 55866 "Resource
>   leak".
> * magick/enum\_strings.c (StringToCompositeOperator): Fix Coverity
>   issue 139296 "Constant expression result".
> * magick/channel.c (ImportImageChannelsMasked): Fix Coverity issue
>   139297 "Constant expression result". This was a bug but only in
>   terms of reduced performance, not results.
> * Magick++/lib/Drawable.cpp
>   (PathSmoothCurvetoRel::operator): Fix Coverity issue 139301 "Using
>   invalid iterator".
>   (PathSmoothCurvetoRel::operator): Fix Coverity issue 139302 "Using
>   invalid iterator"
> * magick/attribute.c: From SourceForge patches #47
>   "GraphicsMagick-1.3.25-get-exif-attribute-gps-fix.patch" and
>   "GraphicsMagick-1.3.25-set-exif-orientation-fix.patch" by Troy
>   Patteson with description (related to provided Coverity reports in
>   coverity.txt): Those coverity errors indicate a problem with the
>   earlier patch I sent you to fix getting the EXIF orientation when
>   the GPS IFD occurs before the EXIF IFD. Although the patch fixed
>   that issue it introduced a new issue in that GPS tags could no
>   longer be retrieved. This occurs because the gpsfound flag is set
>   when the GPS IFD is pushed onto the stack but then cleared
>   immediately when breaking out of the loop processing the directory
>   entries for the current IFD. The solution is to push the gpsfound
>   flag onto the stack as well as it needs to be set when the GPS IFD
>   is popped off the stack rather than being set straight away.
>
>   The second coverity error relates to gpsoffset not being set in
>   FindEXIFAttribute(). The code that sets gpsoffset in
>   GenerateEXIFAttribute() was embedded in the code that gets tags
>   values which was removed in FindEXIFAttribute() as only the DE
>   offset is required. I have removed the need for gpsoffset and just
>   computed the GPS IFD offset when pushing it onto the stack in the
>   same way the EXIF IFD offset is computed.

2016-12-18 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * magick/attribute.c: From SourceForge patches #47
>   "GraphicsMagick-1.3.25-5-set-exif-orientation.patch" by Troy
>   Patteson with description: Rotating an image without resetting the
>   EXIF orientation tag is problematic as follow-on viewers that
>   support the EXIF orientation tag may incorrectly rotate the image
>   a second time. For JPEG images, the current solution is to either
>   strip the image, remove the EXIF profile or modify the EXIF data
>   of the written image with other software. This patch adds the
>   ability to set the orientation tag in the EXIF profile via the
>   SetImageAttribute on attribute EXIF:Orientation provided the EXIF
>   orientation already exists. AutoOrientImage() has been modified to
>   set the EXIF orientation tag on successful rotation of the image.
>
>   The implementation is less than ideal. The EXIF profile must be
>   duplicated because it is returned read-only from the profiles
>   map. Large amounts of the GenerateEXIFAttribute() function has
>   been duplicated in a function called FindEXIFAttribute() which
>   returns the offset in the EXIF profile of a given tag ID. Once
>   found, the orientation tag value is updated accordingly and the
>   new EXIF profile set. Despite the patches shortcomings, I believe
>   it is preferable to leaving the EXIF orientation tag unchanged
>   after auto-orienting the image.
> * wand/magick\_wand.c (MagickClearException): From SourceForge
>   patches #47 "GraphicsMagick-1.3.25-1-wand-clear-exception.patch"
>   by Troy Patteson with description: This patch adds the ability to
>   clear the last Wand exception. This is particularly useful to
>   clear any exception on the Wand before calling MagickReadImage()
>   which can return success with a warning exception such as "JPEG
>   data: premature end of data segment".
>   (MagickRemoveImageOption): From SourceForge patches #47
>   "GraphicsMagick-1.3.25-2-wand-remove-image-option.patch" by Troy
>   Patteson with description: There is MagickSetImageOption() to set
>   options like JPEG preserve-settings but no way to remove the
>   option once set. Since the mechanism to remove image options
>   already exists in lower-level API there seems no reason not to
>   expose it in the Wand API.
>   (MagickGetImageOrientation, MagickSetImageOrientation): From
>   SourceForge patches #47
>   "GraphicsMagick-1.3.25-3-wand-get-set-orientation.patch" by Troy
>   Patteson with description: MagickGetImageOrientation returns the
>   internal orientation setting which is useful to know to determine
>   whether an image needs rotation. The function to set the
>   orientation is less useful as it only sets the internal
>   orientation setting which is only used when writing out TIFF
>   files. A future patch addresses this issue.
>   (MagickAutoOrientImage): From SourceForge patches #47
>   "GraphicsMagick-1.3.25-4-wand-auto-orient.patch" by Troy Patteson
>   with description: This patch adds auto-orient image to the Wand
>   API.

2016-12-17 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * TclMagick/{configure.ac, Makefile.am}: Applied patches by
>   Massimo Manghi to use TEA tcl.m4 version 3.9.

2016-11-26 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/gif.c (DecodeImage): Applied fixes by Tianyu Lang for
>   "Excessive LZW string data" problem leading to "Corrupt image"
>   report while reading some GIF files.

2016-11-18 Glenn Randers-Pehrson <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * doc/options.imdoc, doc/config\_files.imdoc, doc/benchmark.imdoc:
>   Fixed some indentation in the documentation.

2016-10-29 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * acinclude.m4 (LIBS): Fix memory leaks in GM\_FUNC\_MMAP\_FILEIO
>   macro test-case so that it can be used successfully with ASAN
>   compilation options.
> * magick/blob.c: Eliminate unused variable compiler warnings when
>   HAVE\_MMAP\_FILEIO is not defined.

2016-10-24 Fojtik Jaroslav <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

> * coders/mat.c Ability to read multiple images from Matlab V4 format.

2016-10-21 Glenn Randers-Pehrson <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> \*coders/png.c (ReadOneJNGImage): Enforce spec requirement that the
> dimensions of the JPEG embedded in a JDAT chunk must match the
> JHDR dimensions. This issue was assigned CVE-2016-9830 on
> 2016-12-04. Please note that GraphicsMagick's pixel, width, and
> height default limits are often greater than the dimension limits
> of JNG and JPEG so the user should add explicit limits (if needed)
> to prevent unexpected memory consumption from properly-constructed
> JNG files with large dimensions.
>
> \*doc/options.imdoc (-strip): Added a caution to not use the -strip
> option to remove author, copyright, and license information
> when redistributing an image that requires them to be retained.
>
> \*doc/options.imdoc (-comment and -label): Document the fact that
> only one comment or label is stored, and how they are stored in
> PNG files.

2016-10-13 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/sgi.c (ReadSGIImage): Adjusts some variable types and
>   lessen the amount of casting.

2016-10-09 Glenn Randers-Pehrson <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/png.c (ReadJNGImage): Quiet COVERITY issue about
>   a potential memory leak.

2016-10-09 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/xcf.c (ReadXCFImage): Fix memory leak of layer\_info for
>   some recently added error-return paths.

2016-10-08 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/sgi.c (ReadSGIImage): For RLE SGI image, defer memory
>   allocations for as long as possible and allow the file to prove
>   itself worthy before making the largest allocations. This helps
>   with rejecting bogus RLE files while avoiding rejecting valid
>   files.

2016-10-06 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): If TIFF uses Old JPEG
>   compression, then read using full tiles or strips. Solves
>   "Improper call to JPEG library in state 0. (LibJpeg)." error.
>   Problem was reported via email on October 6, 2016 by John Brown.

2016-10-04 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * magick/attribute.c (GenerateEXIFAttribute): Fixed SourceForge
>   bug 400 "Exif orientation unknown for some JPEG files". Patch
>   submitted by Troy Patteson.

2016-10-02 Fojtik Jaroslav <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

> * coders/wpg.c Add sanity check for palette. Merge
>   RemoveLastImageFromList+AppendImageToList to ReplaceImageInList.
>   Possible heap overflow of colormap in Q8 build was assigned
>   CVE-2016-7996. Assertion crash due to blob != NULL was assigned
>   CVE-2016-7997.

2016-10-01 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/meta.c (parse8BIM): Fix unsigned underflow leading to
>   heap overflow when parsing 8BIM chunk. Problem was reported by
>   Marco Grassi via email on October 1, 2016. Problem was already
>   known (but not fixed) based on comments in the code. This issue
>   has been assigned CVE-2016-7800.

2016-09-28 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/xcf.c: Improve the robustness of the XCF reader by adding
>   more error checking.

2016-09-27 Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

> * coders/rle.c (RLEConstrainColormapIndex): Was not constraining
