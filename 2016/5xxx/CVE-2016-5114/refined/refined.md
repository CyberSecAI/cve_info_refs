Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the misuse of the `snprintf()` function in `fpm_log.c`. Specifically, the code incorrectly interprets the return value of `snprintf()`. When the output is truncated due to the size limit, `snprintf()` returns the number of characters that would have been written if sufficient space had been available, not the number of characters actually written. The code then uses this "would have been written" value to increase the buffer length, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Memory leak: Due to the incorrect length calculation, the allocated log buffer isn't fully used and might leave some memory allocated, leading to memory leak.
- Buffer overflow: After the loop, a newline character is written outside of the intended buffer due to the incorrectly calculated length, resulting in a buffer overflow.
- Out-of-bounds read: The data from out-of-bounds memory is read and written to the access log due to the incorrect length calculation.

Impact of exploitation:
- Binary output in access logs, potentially leaking sensitive process memory information to an untrusted user.
- Program crashes due to buffer overflow.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a HTTP request with a very long query string, combined with a specific `access.format` configuration in the PHP-FPM ini file (specifically including `%{REQUEST_URI}e`).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with arbitrary query strings to a server running a vulnerable PHP-FPM version with the specified `access.format`.
- No special position or privileges are required on the targeted server

Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies within the gd library's handling of image rotation, specifically in the `gdTransformAffineCopy()` function. When rotating an image, insufficient input validation can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Out-of-bounds memory read: A crafted image file with specific dimensions and background color settings can trigger an out-of-bounds read when being rotated by the `gdImageRotateInterpolated()` function due to lack of proper size validation.

Impact of exploitation:
- Information disclosure: The out-of-bounds read could expose sensitive data from process memory.
- Crash: The application might crash due to memory access errors.

Attack vectors:
- An attacker could provide a specially crafted image that has certain dimensions and settings that lead to memory access outside of the allocated buffer when image rotation is attempted via the `gdImageRotateInterpolated()` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted image as input to a PHP application using GD library.

Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause is the misinterpretation of the return value of the `snprintf` function. The code incorrectly used the return value (which can be the number of characters *that would have been written*) to increment the buffer length, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Out-of-bounds write: Writing data beyond the allocated buffer due to incorrect return value of `snprintf`.
- Memory leak: Due to incorrect calculations, memory is allocated but not properly used and freed.
- Out-of-boundaries read: Data from memory beyond the buffer is read and written to the log file.

Impact of exploitation:
- Log injection: The vulnerability enables writing extra bytes from process memory into the log files which can be readable by untrusted users.
- Buffer overflow: The code attempts to write a newline character outside the buffer which could lead to crashes or further security exploits.

Attack vectors:
- A malicious user can send an HTTP request with a long query string to a PHP-FPM server that has a vulnerable configuration. The vulnerability is exposed through the `access.format` option in the PHP-FPM configuration, which includes `%{REQUEST_URI}e`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with large query strings. They do not need any special access or privileges on the target server.

Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause of this vulnerability is the incorrect processing of large filenames in several PHP extensions. Specifically, the `link()` function and the DirectoryIterator class silently truncate filenames after a null byte. This issue stems from a lack of proper validation and handling of null bytes in file paths.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Truncation Vulnerability: The `link()` function and the DirectoryIterator class silently truncate file names after a null byte. This could potentially lead to security issues such as file creation in unintended locations.
- Information disclosure: The truncation of file names may cause issues such as wrong path interpretation

Impact of exploitation:
- Possible open\_basedir bypass by using symlink created with name containing null bytes.
- When accessing files using DirectoryIterator, path may be interpreted incorrectly.

Attack vectors:
- This vulnerability is exploited when a program attempts to use the `link()` function or the DirectoryIterator class with a file or directory name that contains an embedded null byte.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker does not require special privileges and can be an user that is able to create symlinks with name containing null bytes using operating system features and read files through DirectoryIterator.
