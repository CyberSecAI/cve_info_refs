Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5261:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided text explicitly mentions "CVE-2016-5261" in multiple places and describes the vulnerability as an "integer overflow in WebSockets during data buffering," which matches the official CVE description. Therefore the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `WebSocketChannel::ProcessInput` function when resizing a buffer for incoming packets, leading to heap memory corruption.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Integer overflow due to incorrect type handling of a 64-bit payload length, and a 32 bit fragment accumulator, allowing a crafted size to wrap around a 32 bit maximum.
    *   Memory corruption caused by an incorrect buffer resize, leading to a write outside the allocated buffer.
    *   The vulnerability exists in the WebSocketChannel class within the WebSockets subsystem.
  
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Remote code execution by writing attacker controlled data into a known memory offset, leading to exploitable crash.
    *   Denial of service by crashing the application.
    *   Potential for memory corruption.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered via crafted websocket packets sent from a malicious web server to a vulnerable browser.
    *   The attacker controls the data written outside the allocated buffer through websocket messages.
    *   The initial request to the websocket server can be done from a web page loaded locally (file:// scheme).

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web server that can send crafted WebSocket messages.
    *   The user must interact with a malicious web page or application that establishes a websocket connection to the malicious server.

*   **Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**
    *   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect check of the payload size against the maximum message size in WebSocketChannel::ProcessInput due to an implicit type conversion.
    *   The fix involves adding an additional check using the CheckedInt template to ensure a sum of a 64 bit value and an unsigned 32 bit integer is within the valid 32-bit integer range before it is used as a size specifier when resizing the buffer, preventing an integer overflow.
    *   The fix landed in Firefox versions 48, 49, 50 and Firefox ESR 45.4.
    *   The vulnerability is described as security-critical or security-high, implying that it can be easily exploited.
    *   A proof-of-concept is provided to reproduce the bug in a test setup.
