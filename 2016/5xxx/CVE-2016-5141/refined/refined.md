  "CVE-2016-5141": {
    "Description": "Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via vectors involving a provisional URL for an initially empty document, related to FrameLoader.cpp and ScopedPageLoadDeferrer.cpp.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused due to the improper handling of provisional URLs for initially empty documents within Blink's FrameLoader and ScopedPageLoadDeferrer components. This allows an attacker to manipulate the displayed URL in the address bar.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of provisional URLs",
      "Address bar spoofing vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to spoof the address bar, potentially tricking users into believing they are on a legitimate site when they are on a malicious one. This can lead to phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious web pages that trigger the improper handling of provisional URLs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and lure a victim into visiting it via a link or other means. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the user's system."
