Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5159:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   An integer overflow exists in the `opj_pi_create_decode` function within `pi.c` of the OpenJPEG library. This overflow leads to out-of-bounds read and write operations in the `opj_pi_next_cprl` function, also in `pi.c`.
*   The overflow is caused by incorrect calculations when allocating memory for code blocks in JPEG2000 images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Integer overflow
*   Heap-based buffer overflow
*   Out-of-bounds read and write

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A crafted JPEG2000 image could cause an application using OpenJPEG to crash.
*   Potentially, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on a vulnerable system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious actor crafts a specific JPEG2000 image designed to trigger the integer overflow.
*   This malformed image is then loaded by an application that relies on the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.
*   The vulnerability affects the PDFium component in Chromium, meaning it can be triggered when viewing a crafted JPEG2000 image embedded within a PDF document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver or have the victim open a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.
*   No specific user privileges or authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The issue affects multiple products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7 and Chromium browser.
*   Upstream fixes are available in the openjpeg github repository via specific commits.
*   Test cases are available in the `openjpeg-data` repo, showing a proof of concept.
*   The flaw also impacts the PDF viewer within the Chromium browser due to the usage of the affected OpenJPEG library.
*   Red Hat provided security advisories to address the vulnerability (RHSA-2017:0559, RHSA-2017:0838, RHSA-2016:1854).
*   SUSE and openSUSE also issued updates fixing the issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by GiWan Go and reported via the Chromium project.
*   Patches were backported and the issue was also tracked and resolved in the Debian distribution.
