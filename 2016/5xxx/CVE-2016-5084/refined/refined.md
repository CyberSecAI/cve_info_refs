Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump transmits patient treatment data and device data, including encryption passwords, over the network in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission:** The primary weakness is the lack of encryption for wireless communication between the insulin pump and its remote meter. Data is transmitted in the clear.
*   **CWE-319**: This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-319, which refers to the cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Sniffing:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can eavesdrop on wireless communications and intercept patient treatment data and device data.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** While the attacker cannot obtain personally identifiable information, they can gain access to sensitive operational data that can be used in subsequent attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Radio Frequency (RF) Communication:** The vulnerability is exploited through the device's wireless communication protocol in the 900MHz band.
*   **Remote Access:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a remote location within the range of the device's RF communication, which can be extended beyond the normal range using specialized equipment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** An attacker needs to be within the device's radio range to intercept wireless transmissions, which, in a normal scenario, is about 10 meters. However, with specialized equipment, this range can be extended to a couple kilometers or more.
*   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker requires some technical knowledge to capture and analyze the RF communications.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to intercept the communications.
