Subject: CVE Request for Denial of Service in pacman 5.0.1

The package manager of Arch Linux, pacman, is vulnerable to a denial of
service attack based on signature files. This issue is located in libalpm
and therefore affects any other frontend of it, too.

A malicious signature file can trigger an out of bondary read on 32 and
64 bit systems, but also leads to an endless loop on 32 bit system.

While an endless loop on itself is no security issue per-se, such a
crafted file might trick the end-user to disable signature verification
to get his updates installed. This, on the other hand, would open up
possibilities for malicious packages to be installed.

Therefore, this DoS can be considered a stepping stone towards a system
attack.

Proof of concept (signature verification must be enabled):

$ uname -m
i686
$ PKG=package-1.0.tar.xz
$ touch $PKG
$ echo "iQEcBAABCAAGBQJXTxJiAAr/////+wA=" | base64 -d - > $PKG.sig
$ sudo pacman -U $PKG
_

The out of boundary access can be used to send 8 bytes inside the
address space of a root-running program to a keyserver, as long as the
byte in front of them is 0x10.

This issue with a patch has been reported upstream. [1]

Can you assign a CVE-ID for this?

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

# [pacman-dev] [PATCH] Fix OOB read and endless loop in signature parser.

```
The parser in alpm_extract_keyid does not properly check boundaries,
which makes it vulnerable to malicious input for out ouf bondary reads.
I did not attach a proof of concept for this one, because it is very
system-specific if you see a segmentation fault or not. If in doubt,
you won't notice it. ;)

It is also possible to trigger an endless loop with a malicious
signature file on 32 bit systems. A proof of concept for this can
be triggered through this crafted file (SigLevel must be properly set
for local files):

$ uname -m
i686
$ PKG=package-1.0.tar.xz
$ touch $PKG
$ echo "iQEcBAABCAAGBQJXTxJiAAr/////+wA=" | base64 -d - > $PKG.sig
$ sudo pacman -U $PKG
_

This proof of concept uses the ability to overflow position increments.
By setting lengths to specific values ((size_t)-5 in this example), the
position incrementation effectively ends up at its old position.

This patch does not use GCC-specific overflow checking routines,
because I am not sure if that's applicable for pacman's design goals.

Pacman can enforce database signatures, it is described in the man page:

<https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman.conf.5.html#SC>

The defaults in Arch Linux is currently that package signatures are required,
and database signatures optional. Installing files locally with `-U` is
optional.

SigLevel    = Required DatabaseOptional
LocalFileSigLevel = Optional

The upstream pacman project distributes with signing optional.

Pacman wouldn't downgrade any packages in this case without the user explicitly
asking pacman to do so. Pacman would also issue warning that locally installed
packages are newer then the downgraded ones.

Unless a parsing bug is found the worst case scenario is holding back security
updates for some amount of time until the user notices.

Timestamped databases is also a feature Allan McRae has been working on lately.

<https://git.archlinux.org/users/allan/pacman.git/log/?h=timestamp>

However, as noted, it would still require an online signing key to sign it. This
is argueably one of the larger problems with the Arch Linux package
infrastructure currently as all packager keys are distributed. We haven't come
up with reasonable solution yet as one would need to properly secure said key.

And at a closing note, there hasn't been any issues with the parsing code to the
database. However the one the original author probably thinks of is the CVE from
2016 where there was a bug in the gnupg packet parsing code in relation to GnuPG
signatures.

We assign CVE IDs to infinite loops in libraries, as long as a real or
plausible library-using application runs unattended, and presents an
attack surface in which the loop may be triggered by not-fully-trusted
input.

Use CVE-2016-5434 for this libalpm vulnerability.

(For example, someone may plausibly use libalpm as part of a web
application that receives packages with signatures from authors and,
after validity checks, hosts those packages for public download.)

Maybe, but this would not, by itself, be a reason to assign a CVE ID
unless the package manager suggested that course of action, e.g., a
dialog stating "A signature-verification process is running slowly.
Terminate that process and disable all future verification? [y/N]."
For example, if there were a signature-verification infinite loop that
only affected a GUI package manager, without that type of dialog, then
a CVE ID seems unlikely. First, it's unclear whether there are many
end users who have the expertise to determine that a loop is related
to signature verification, but also would jump to the conclusion that
disabling signature verification was a reasonable solution to their
immediate problem. More generally, any DoS bug in any package manager
might trick a non-expert end user into not bothering to install new
packages, and instead leaving old vulnerable packages installed
permanently. That is arguably a security impact, but it seems much too
indirect, so we don't want to assign CVE IDs to 100% of DoS bugs in
all package managers.
