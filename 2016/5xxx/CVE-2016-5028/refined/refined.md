{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The null dereference is due to a corrupted object file. Libdwarf was not dealing with empty (bss-like) sections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of empty sections in object files"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference causes a crash in `print_frame_inst_bytes` function of `dwarfdump` when processing corrupted DWARF data, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious ELF file with a corrupted debug section (specifically, an empty section where DWARF data is expected)."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to create or modify ELF files with specific content that triggers the vulnerability. No specific attacker position is required, but the attacker must be able to provide a malicious file to a user of dwarfdump."
