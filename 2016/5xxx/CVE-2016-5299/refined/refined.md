Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android handles broadcasts of its AuthToken. The AuthToken is sent in a broadcast protected with a signature-level permission. This means any application installed on the same device, that shares the same signing key as Firefox and declares the same permission, can also receive these broadcasts. Therefore, a malicious app installed prior to Firefox could intercept these broadcasts and gain access to Firefox's AuthToken.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Broadcast Permissions:** Using signature-level permissions for sensitive data like AuthTokens was the primary weakness. This permission model allows other apps signed with the same key to listen in on broadcasts intended only for Firefox.
*   **Lack of LocalBroadcastManager:** The broadcast was not sent via Android's `LocalBroadcastManager`, which restricts broadcasts to applications within the same process, and therefore would have prevented the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **AuthToken Theft:** An attacker could obtain a valid Firefox AuthToken, potentially allowing access to the user's Firefox account and data.
*   **Account Takeover:** While not explicitly stated, the stolen AuthToken could potentially be used to impersonate the user on Firefox services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious App Installation:** The primary attack vector is to have a malicious application installed *before* Firefox, that declares the same signature-level permission used by Firefox to broadcast the AuthToken. This can be achieved by various means like side-loading an app or through other distribution methods outside the official app store (if it is possible for this malicious app to be signed with the same key as Firefox).
*   **Broadcast Interception:** Once installed, the malicious application can passively receive broadcasts sent by Firefox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Android Application Development:** The attacker needs to be able to develop an Android application.
*   **Same Signing Key:** The malicious app needs to be signed with the same key that Firefox uses or with a key that is trusted by Firefox. This is the main issue with the signature-level permission model.
*   **Prior Installation:** The malicious app must be installed *before* the Firefox app on the target device.
*   **Android API knowledge:** The attacker must have knowledge of the specific Android APIs used by Firefox for account management and AuthToken broadcasts.

**Additional Notes**
The issue is specific to Android because of the signature-level permission feature in the Android OS and does not affect other platforms. The vulnerability was resolved by switching from sending the AuthToken via broadcast to directly invoking the service and by using `LocalBroadcastManager`. The provided source also mentions that a similar vulnerability was fixed in Bug 1229681 with regards to content providers and signature-level permissions.

**Summary**

The issue is an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data due to an insecure implementation of Android permissions. A malicious application, installed before Firefox, could intercept the AuthToken via a broadcast mechanism and potentially use it to gain unauthorized access to a user's Firefox account.
