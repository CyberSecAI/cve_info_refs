Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5293:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Mozilla Updater using a log file in its working directory. If this log file is a hardlink, any data appended to the log will instead be written to the file that the hardlink points to. This allows for arbitrary local file writing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Hardlink Handling:** The Mozilla Updater does not properly handle hardlinks when writing to its log file. It appends data to the file pointed to by the hardlink instead of the expected log file.
- **Lack of validation:** The updater fails to validate if the log file is a regular file or a hardlink.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write arbitrary data to a file on the local system where the user has write permissions.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability can be exploited for privilege escalation by overwriting a configuration or script file which is subsequently used/parsed by a process with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker with local system access can create a hardlink named `updater.log` that points to an arbitrary file on the system.
- When the Mozilla Updater runs, it will attempt to append data to what it believes is `updater.log`. However, because of the hardlink, data will be appended to the attacker's chosen target file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local system access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to create hardlinks and initiate the update process.
- **Write permissions:** The attacker needs to have write permissions on a file that they want to overwrite.

**Additional details:**

- This vulnerability is specific to the Windows operating system.
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the append option from logging.
- This vulnerability was introduced in Firefox 42 to fix a different security bug related to user writable locations.
- The fix landed on Firefox 50 and ESR 45.5.
