## Workarounds and Mitigations

With default trace levels (GENERAL, SM, SMVERBOSE, SERVICE), the password is displayed.

To minimize exposure to this vulnerability, do not use tracing in the dsm.opt file and prevent tracing of command "dsmsetpw" unless instructed to do so by IBM. Delete existing trace files that are no longer needed.
