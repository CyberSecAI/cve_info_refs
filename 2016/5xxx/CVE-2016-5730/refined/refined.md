Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2016-5730 lies in several areas of phpMyAdmin where insufficient input validation or error handling leads to the disclosure of the full server path. This occurs through:

1.  **FormDisplay.php:** Passing an array value to this file can trigger a path disclosure.
2.  **validate.php:** Incorrect data sent to this file can cause a path disclosure.
3.  **Validator.php:** Unexpected data sent to this validator can lead to a path disclosure.
4.  **Missing config directory during setup:** Absence of the config directory during setup can cause path disclosure in an error message
5.  **Incorrect OpenID identifier data type:** Providing an incorrect data type for OpenID identifier can also disclose the path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the full server path where phpMyAdmin is installed. This happens due to error messages revealing the server's filesystem structure.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacks proper checks on the types and formats of data passed to key components, allowing crafted or unexpected data to cause errors revealing sensitive paths.
*   **Inadequate Error Handling:** The system fails to properly handle error conditions, leading to verbose error messages that expose internal system information like full paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The most immediate impact is the exposure of the server's full filesystem path. This information could be used by attackers to map out the system and identify further potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Knowing the exact path makes it easier for attackers to target specific files and directories for further attacks, for example, exploiting other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** The vulnerabilities are accessible remotely, allowing unauthenticated attackers to exploit them via network requests.
*   **Malformed requests:** Attackers can send malformed or crafted data to phpMyAdmin through various web requests to specific scripts like `FormDisplay.php`, `validate.php`, and related components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers require network access to the phpMyAdmin instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning no prior access to the system is necessary.
*   **Ability to craft web requests:** Attackers need to be capable of crafting HTTP requests with specific malformed or unexpected parameters to trigger the path disclosure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to have a **moderate** severity.
*   The issue was fixed in phpMyAdmin versions **4.0.10.16**, **4.4.15.7**, and **4.6.3** and later.
*   SUSE has indicated that this CVE does not affect their products and recommends updating to the fixed versions.
*   The provided GitHub commit diffs show the fixes in `examples/openid.php`, `setup/config.php`, `setup/frames/index.inc.php`, `setup/validate.php`, and `libraries/config/Validator.php`. These changes include type checking, exception handling, input sanitization, and improved error messages for edge cases, preventing path disclosures.
*  The phpMyAdmin security advisory [PMASA-2016-23](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2016-23/) specifically addresses these full-path disclosure vulnerabilities.

This CVE primarily exposes sensitive information rather than allowing direct control or manipulation of the system. It's a good example of how insufficient input validation and error handling can create significant security issues.
