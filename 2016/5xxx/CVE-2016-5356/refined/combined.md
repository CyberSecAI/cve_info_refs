This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Don't treat the packet length as unsigned.

```
The scanf family of functions are as annoyingly bad at handling unsigned
numbers as strtoul() is - both of them are perfectly willing to accept a
value beginning with a negative sign as an unsigned value.  When using
strtoul(), you can compensate for this by explicitly checking for a '-'
as the first character of the string, but you can't do that with
sscanf().

So revert to having pkt_len be signed, and scanning it with %d, but
check for a negative value and fail if we see a negative value.

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the dissectors/parsers for
PKTC, IAX2, GSM CBCH and NCP, SPOOLS, IEEE 802.11, UMTS FP, USB,
Toshiba, CoSine, NetScreen, WBXML which could result in denial of service
or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+g01b65bf-4+deb8u7.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.4+gdd7746e-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4+gdd7746e-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.

Fix packet length handling.

```
Treat the packet length as unsigned - it shouldn't be negative in the
file.  If it is, that'll probably cause the sscanf to fail, so we'll
report the file as bad.

Check it against WTAP_MAX_PACKET_SIZE to make sure we don't try to
allocate a huge amount of memory, just as we do in other file readers.

Use the now-validated packet size as the length in
ws_buffer_assure_space(), so we are certain to have enough space, and
don't allocate too much space.

Merge the header and packet data parsing routines while we're at it.

## wnpa-sec-2016-35 · CoSine file parser crash

## Summary

**Name:** CoSine file parser crash

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2016-35

**Date:** June 7, 2016

**Affected versions:** 2.0.0 to 2.0.3, 1.12.0 to 1.12.11

**Fixed versions:** 2.0.4, 1.12.12

**References:**

[Wireshark issue 12395](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/12395).

[CVE-2016-5356](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5356).

## Details

### Description

The CoSine file parser could crash. Discovered by iDefense Labs.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark
crash

by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 2.0.4, 1.12.12 or later.
