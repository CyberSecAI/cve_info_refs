- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in Huawei FusionInsight.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly validate input, leading to a potential exploit.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain root privileges on the Linux system where FusionInsight is installed and control the entire operating system cluster.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to log in to the Linux system as an "omm" user where FusionInsight is deployed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid credentials to log in as the "omm" user on the target system.
