- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges are required, but exploitation requires a difficult-to-achieve attack condition.
