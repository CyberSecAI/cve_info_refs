Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Incomplete validation of incoming SAML requests in NetIQ Access Manager Identity Server. Specifically, when receiving an unsigned SAML2 authentication request containing an explicit Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, the Identity Provider (IDP) failed to verify if the provided ACS URL matched or was even listed in the metadata for the Service Provider (SP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of ACS URL Validation:** The IDP did not validate the ACS URL provided in unsigned SAML requests against the SP's metadata or any allowed list.
*   **Violation of SAML2 Standard:** The implementation was in direct contravention of the SAML2 standard, which requires verification of the ACS URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Redirection to Rogue Site:** An attacker could craft a malicious unsigned SAML authentication request with a manipulated ACS URL, causing the IDP to send the SAML response (including sensitive information like user assertions) to a rogue site controlled by the attacker. This is a form of open redirect.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive information within the SAML response could be exposed to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unsigned SAML Authentication Request:** The attacker crafts an unsigned SAML2 authentication request.
*   **Manipulated ACS URL:**  The malicious request includes a crafted `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` that points to the attacker's controlled server.
*   **Targeting Vulnerable IDP:**  The attack targets a vulnerable NetIQ Access Manager Identity Server that does not validate the ACS URL in unsigned requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to generate SAML Requests:** An attacker needs the ability to generate SAML authentication requests
*   **Knowledge of Target IDP:** The attacker needs knowledge of the target Access Manager IDP and its lack of ACS URL validation on unsigned requests.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send the crafted SAML request to the vulnerable IDP
*   **Hosting of Rogue Server:** The attacker needs to control a server where the manipulated ACS URL points to, in order to receive the SAML response.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in NetIQ Access Manager 4.2.2 and 4.1.2 HF1. These patches introduce an option to enable validation of the ACS URL against the SP metadata or a configured whitelist. This option is disabled by default and needs to be enabled.
*   **Workaround:** As a workaround before patching, the SP should sign the SAML authentication requests.

This vulnerability is a significant security flaw as it allows for the potential redirection of SAML responses, including sensitive information, to untrusted third parties. The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description as it includes specifics on how to exploit and mitigate this vulnerability, including product names, versions, and configuration steps.
