**CVE-2016-5796**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap memory corruption.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Denial of service (crash).
    *   Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: Sending additional valid packets.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker. Low skill level is sufficient to exploit. The attacker requires some form of network connectivity to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes**

*   The document mentions two additional vulnerabilities, CVE-2016-5798 and CVE-2016-5800, both related to stack-based buffer overflows. However, since this analysis is specifically for CVE-2016-5796, details for those have been excluded.
*   The vendor, FATEK Automation, has not released any updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory provides mitigation strategies focused on network segmentation, firewall usage, and VPN usage (with awareness of VPN vulnerabilities).
*   The advisory also mentions the existence of a Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) advisory related to the PM Designer vulnerability, accessible at: `http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-16-525/`.
