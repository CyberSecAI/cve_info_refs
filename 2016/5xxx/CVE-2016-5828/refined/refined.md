{
  "CVE-2016-5828": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel on powerpc platforms mishandles transactional memory state on exec().",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of transactional memory state on exec() syscalls, specifically when a transaction is suspended before the exec() syscall, leading to a use of freed memory or improper state handling.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash), kernel memory corruption or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged local user with the ability to start and suspend transactions before calling an exec() class system call is required."
