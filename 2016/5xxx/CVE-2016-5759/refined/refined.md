Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `mkdumprd` script, specifically how it invokes `dracut`. The script was calling `dracut` in the current working directory (`.`). This allowed a local user to create a malicious `dracut` executable in the current directory and trick the administrator into executing it as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Path Handling:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure way `mkdumprd` was invoking `dracut` by relying on the current working directory, instead of using an absolute path. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** A local user could craft a malicious `dracut` script or executable. When the administrator runs `mkdumprd`, the malicious code would be executed with root privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, system modification, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system and be able to create files in a directory where the administrator may execute the `mkdumprd` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create files in the current working directory where an administrator would run `mkdumprd`.
*   **Knowledge of `mkdumprd` Execution:** The attacker needs to be aware that the administrator is likely to execute `mkdumprd` and be able to anticipate when/where they might.
*   **Ability to create a malicious `dracut` executable:** The attacker would need the ability to craft a `dracut` executable/script that would execute their malicious code.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was rated as "moderate" severity by SUSE.
*   The fix was to use the full path to `dracut` when invoking it within the `mkdumprd` script.
*   The vulnerability is associated with the `kdump` package.
*  The fix was included in the `kdump` package update with version `0.8.15-29.1` for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Desktop 12 SP1 as well as openSUSE Leap 42.1 with version `0.8.15-27.1`.
