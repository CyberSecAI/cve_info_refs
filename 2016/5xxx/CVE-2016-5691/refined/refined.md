Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5691:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the DCM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image format parser within ImageMagick. Specifically, it occurs during the processing of pixel data after scaling.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The core issue is a lack of validation on pixel component values (red, green, and blue) *after* they have been scaled using a scaling table. The code attempts to use the scaled pixel values as indices into the `scale` array again, without ensuring that they are within the valid range of the `scale` array.

```c
  if (scale != (Quantum *) NULL)
    {
      pixel.red=scale[pixel.red]; 
      pixel.green=scale[pixel.green];
      pixel.blue=scale[pixel.blue];
      if (pixel.red <= GetQuantumRange(depth))
          pixel.red=scale[pixel.red];
      if (pixel.green <= GetQuantumRange(depth))
         pixel.green=scale[pixel.green];
      if (pixel.blue <= GetQuantumRange(depth))
        pixel.blue=scale[pixel.blue];
    }
```
The vulnerability is present on the second set of pixel scaling.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The lack of validation can lead to out-of-bounds memory access when reading from the `scale` array. This could result in a crash (segfault) or potentially other memory corruption issues.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is a crafted DCM image file. By manipulating the pixel values in the DCM file, an attacker can cause scaled pixel values to fall outside the bounds of the `scale` array.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DCM file to a system using ImageMagick to process it. No special system access or privilege is required beyond the ability to submit a file.

**Additional notes:**

- This vulnerability is related to several other issues in the DCM parser which were addressed in the same commit.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick versions 7.0.1-7 and 6.9.4-5.
- The fix involves adding validation checks on the scaled pixel values before using them as indices into the scaling array.
- Oracle Solaris lists this CVE as being fixed in their July 2016 Third Party Bulletin.
