Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5036:

**CVE Description:**

The CVE description is a placeholder, as the content provides the details for this CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the `dump_block()` function within `print_sections.c`. This occurs when processing corrupted frame data. The frame code was not detecting the data corruption leading to the OOB read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code reads beyond the allocated memory for the frame data, leading to a crash or undefined behavior.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code fails to validate the frame data for corruption and doesn't perform proper bounds checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a crash of the application by providing a specially crafted object file. This can be achieved via the `dwarfdump` utility.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious object files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted object file that contains corrupted frame data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to provide a malicious file:** An attacker needs the ability to provide the specially crafted object file to the application.
