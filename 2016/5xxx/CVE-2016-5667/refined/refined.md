Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-5667:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The web interface of the Crestron Electronics DM-TXRX-100-STR device does not properly enforce authentication for all resources, specifically when accessing deeper URI paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'):** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication by directly accessing deep web interface URIs without first authenticating through the `index.html` page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can access and potentially modify device configurations without proper authorization. This can lead to complete control of the affected devices.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by directly crafting requests to specific, deeper URI paths on the device's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface, meaning they need to have network access to the device. No authentication is required to exploit this specific vulnerability.
