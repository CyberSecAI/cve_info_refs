**CVE-2016-5292: URL parsing causes crash**

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability in the URL parsing logic of Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, the `nsStandardURL::CoalescePath` function was not correctly normalizing URLs, particularly when handling sequences like `%2e` (which represents a dot '.'). This incorrect normalization led to issues with offsets and resulted in a crash during string comparison within the `_platform_strncmp` function. The vulnerability was introduced by the changes from bug 1042347.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper input validation in the URL parsing function. The function was expecting to normalize only directories but it normalized the whole filepath, which resulted in incorrect offsets.
    *   The `strcmp` function was operating on potentially corrupted pointers due to the incorrect URL normalization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A maliciously crafted URL, when loaded, could cause a crash in Firefox.
    *   The crash could be potentially exploitable since it's a memory corruption issue.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through a malicious URL, likely embedded in a webpage.
    *   An attacker could induce a user to load a malicious URL, either directly or indirectly (e.g. through an iframe).
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing specific characters such as '%2e' that exploit the parsing logic flaw.
    *   The attacker needs to get the user to load the malicious URL through a webpage or other means.
    * No special access level is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
*   The bug was reproducible on macOS and Linux but not Windows, likely due to different memory layouts and how `strcmp` handles invalid addresses on different OS.
*   The root cause was related to changes introduced by bug 1042347.
*   The fix involved reverting the changes from bug 1042347 because a more complicated fix for the issue was not feasible in a short time frame.
*   The issue was deemed critical due to its potential for remote exploitation via crafted URLs, leading to a crash.
*   Affected versions include Firefox 47, 48, and 49, but ESR45 was unaffected.
