- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow in the Fatek Communication Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious attacker can trigger a remote buffer overflow leading to a crash, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious packets over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the vulnerable server; low skill level.
