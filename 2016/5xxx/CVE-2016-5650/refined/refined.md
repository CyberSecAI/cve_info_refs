Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Zmodo ZP-NE14-S DVR and ZP-IBH-13W cameras exhibit a "Not Failing Securely" behavior. Specifically, they can be forced to deauthenticate from an encrypted Wi-Fi network (e.g., WPA2) and connect to an unencrypted network with the same SSID if the unencrypted network has a stronger signal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-636: Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open'):** The devices prioritize signal strength over security settings, allowing them to connect to unencrypted networks even when configured to use encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can force the devices to connect to an unencrypted network that the attacker controls.
*   This could allow an attacker to intercept network traffic, potentially including sensitive data.
*   The attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Evil Twin Attack:** An attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi network with the same SSID as the legitimate network used by the Zmodo devices.
*   **Signal Strength Manipulation:** The attacker uses stronger transmission power to ensure the rogue network's signal is stronger than the legitimate one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the Zmodo device.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to set up a rogue access point and manipulate signal strength.
*   **SSID Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the SSID of the network the device is configured to connect to.
