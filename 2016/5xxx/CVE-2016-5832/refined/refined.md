Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5832:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to the disclosure of revision history information. The specific cause isn't detailed beyond this, but it indicates an issue in how WordPress handles or restricts access to post revision history.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to access sensitive revision history data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure**: An attacker could potentially gain access to previous versions of posts, including drafts, deleted content, or other sensitive information that should not be publicly accessible. This can leak confidential or private data that was not intended to be visible in the current published version of the post.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The specific attack vector is not explicitly defined but it can be inferred that an attacker can somehow bypass access control on revision history.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to be able to interact with the WordPress site. The specific level of access required is not specified, but it could potentially be exploitable by an unauthenticated user or by an attacker with lower privileges.

**Additional Notes**
* This CVE was addressed in WordPress version 4.5.3.
* The vulnerability was reported independently by John Blackbourn from the WordPress security team and by Dan Moen from the Wordfence Research Team.
