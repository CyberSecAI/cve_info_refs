## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5739 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5739)

#### Description

The Transformation implementation in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 does not use the no-referrer Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks by reading an authentication token in a Referer header, related to libraries/Header.php.

                 CVE-2016-5739

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in phpMyAdmin, the web-based
MySQL administration interface.

CVE-2016-1927

    The suggestPassword function relied on a non-secure random number
    generator which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess
    generated passwords via a brute-force approach.

CVE-2016-2039

    CSRF token values were generated by a non-secure random number
    genrator, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
    restrictions by predicting a value.

CVE-2016-2040

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2041

    phpMyAdmin does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing
    CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
    intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.

CVE-2016-2560

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2561

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5099

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5701

    For installations running on plain HTTP, phpMyAdmin allows remote
    attackers to conduct BBCode injection attacks against HTTP sessions
    via a crafted URI.

CVE-2016-5705

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5706

    phpMyAdmin allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (resource consumption) via a large array in the scripts parameter.

CVE-2016-5731

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5733

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5739

    A specially crafted Transformation could leak information which
    a remote attacker could use to perform cross site request forgeries.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.2.12-2+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.6.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.

# phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-32**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in phpMyAdmin, the worst
of which could lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.6.5.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.6.5.1** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a web-based management tool for MySQL databases.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A authenticated remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary PHP Code, inject SQL code, or to conduct Cross-Site
Scripting attacks.

In certain configurations, an unauthenticated remote attacker could
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-4.6.5.1"

```

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2016-26

**Date:** 2016-06-23

### Summary

Multiple XSS vulnerabilities

### Description

* A vulnerability was reported allowing a specially crafted table name to cause an XSS attack through the functionality to check database privileges.
  + This XSS doesn't exist in some translations due to different quotes being used there (eg. Czech).
* A vulnerability was reported allowing a specifically-configured MySQL server to execute an XSS attack. This particular attack requires configuring the MySQL server log\_bin directive with the payload.
* Several XSS vulnerabilities were found with the Transformation feature
* Several XSS vulnerabilities were found in AJAX error handling
* Several XSS vulnerabilities were found in the Designer feature
* An XSS vulnerability was found in the charts feature
* An XSS vulnerability was found in the zoom search feature

### Severity

We consider these attacks to be of moderate severity.

### Affected Versions

All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.3), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.7), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.16) are affected
