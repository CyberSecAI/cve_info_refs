  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-5739",
    "description": "The Transformation implementation in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 does not use the no-referrer Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks by reading an authentication token in a Referer header, related to libraries/Header.php.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "4.0.x before 4.0.10.16",
      "4.4.x before 4.4.15.7",
      "4.6.x before 4.6.3"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Transformation implementation in phpMyAdmin does not utilize the no-referrer Content Security Policy (CSP), which allows for the leakage of sensitive information such as authentication tokens via the Referer header.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "CSRF",
	    "Information Leakage"
      ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by exploiting the leaked authentication tokens. This could allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker would send a crafted request to the phpMyAdmin application.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send a crafted request to the phpMyAdmin application and induce the user to make a request that will expose the Referer header. This may require some form of social engineering."
