Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in multiple iManager application URLs of NetIQ Access Manager. The application fails to validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the application does not sanitize user-controlled parameters before reflecting them back in the HTTP response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victimâ€™s web browser. This can lead to:
* Stealing cookie information and hijacking user sessions.
* Loading and executing other malicious code.
* Potentially redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through specially crafted URLs that contain malicious JavaScript code within their parameters. The attacker would need to trick the user into clicking on the manipulated link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and convince a user to access them. This could be done through phishing emails or by embedding the malicious URLs on a website. The attacker doesn't need to be in the same network as the target.

**Affected parameters:**
The following parameters have been identified as vulnerable:
* `/nps/servlet/frameservice` parameter: `taskId`
* `/nps/servlet/webacc` parameter: `SelectedAttribute`

* `/roma/jsp/admin/managementip/mgmt_ip_details_middleframe.jsp` parameter: `managementip`
* `/roma/jsp/volsc/monitoring/appliance.jsp` parameter: `appname`
* `/roma/jsp/volsc/monitoring/appliance.jsp` parameter: `refresh`
* `/roma/jsp/volsc/monitoring/graph.jsp` parameter: `back`
* `/nps/servlet/webacc` parameter: `error`
