Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_31.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, August 31, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 53 to the stable channel - 53.0.2785.89 for Windows, Mac and 53.0.2785.92 for Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks **(Note:** **MSI still points to M52 and will be updated later).**

Chrome 53.0.2785.89 and 53.0.2785.92 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/52.0.2743.116..53.0.2785.92?pretty=fuller&n=10000). ¬†Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 53.
Security Fixes and Rewards
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven‚Äôt yet fixed.

This update includes [33](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M53) security fixes Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[642598](https://crbug.com/642598)] CVE-2016-5167: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). ¬†If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). ¬†The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
