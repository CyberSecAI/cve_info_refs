- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) because it allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can alter the intended functionality of the web UI. This can potentially lead to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to insert JavaScript code into the web UI. This usually requires some form of authenticated access, so low-privileged users can exploit this vulnerability. A user interaction is required, meaning another user has to view the malicious content.
