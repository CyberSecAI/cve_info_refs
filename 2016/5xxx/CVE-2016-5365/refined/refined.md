Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient parameter verification in Huawei Honor routers.
- Specifically, when an attacker injects malicious information, it can lead to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack overflow that occurs when the router parses injected malicious information.
- **Insufficient Parameter Verification:** The root cause is the lack of proper validation of input parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Root Privilege Gain:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root privileges on the router.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** With root access, the attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be connected to the LAN via a wired (LAN port) or wireless (Wi-Fi) connection.
- **Open Port:** The attack involves connecting to an open port on the Honor router and injecting malicious data.
- **Chaining:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can be chained with information leak (CVE-2016-5367) and file injection (CVE-2016-5366) vulnerabilities to gain root access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the targeted router.
- **Knowledge of Exploitation:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and be able to craft malicious data for injection that can trigger the stack overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Huawei Honor routers, specifically the WS851, WS831, and WS832 models with older firmware versions as detailed in the provided document.
- The advisory explicitly mentions that this vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities for a complete compromise.
- The provided CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.8 (AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), indicating a serious security risk with high impact.
