Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5423:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the PostgreSQL server handles SQL statements containing nested CASE/WHEN expressions. Specifically, the server could misinterpret whether the test value within a nested `CASE` expression is NULL or not. Additionally, inlining of a SQL function implementing the equality operator used by a CASE expression could lead to incorrect test values being passed to functions within the CASE expression's body.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect NULL check**: When a `CASE` expression was nested within another `CASE` expression's test value, it could misinterpret the NULL status of its own test value.
- **Incorrect value passing**: Inlining of equality operator SQL functions used by `CASE` expressions could lead to passing of incorrect test values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash**: The vulnerability could cause the PostgreSQL server to crash.
- **Information Disclosure**: It could lead to disclosure of a few bytes of server memory.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution**: The vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution through the memory disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote**: A remote, authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting specially crafted SQL statements containing nested CASE/WHEN commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the PostgreSQL server.
- The attacker needs to be able to submit SQL statements, implying a user with some form of database access.
