Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `netscreen.c` file of Wireshark's libwiretap, specifically in how it parses NetScreen capture files. The `sscanf` function was used to parse the packet length from the capture file, treating it as an unsigned integer using `%u`. However, `sscanf` can still parse values beginning with a negative sign as unsigned, leading to incorrect packet length values. When a negative value is parsed as an unsigned value, it becomes a very large positive value due to the wraparound, which leads to a large memory allocation.  Additionally, the code lacked proper validation of the parsed packet length against `WTAP_MAX_PACKET_SIZE` before allocating memory for the packet data. This means that a specially crafted packet capture file could cause Wireshark to attempt to allocate an extremely large buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Handling of Unsigned Integers:** The `sscanf` function was used improperly to parse what was meant to be an unsigned packet length value. This allowed for a negative number to be interpreted as a very large, unsigned number leading to a large memory allocation.
2.  **Missing Packet Length Validation:** The parsed packet length was not checked against the maximum allowed packet size (`WTAP_MAX_PACKET_SIZE`) before allocation. This allowed the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** By providing a malformed NetScreen capture file with a specially crafted negative value in the packet length field, an attacker could cause Wireshark to crash. This occurs due to a very large memory allocation attempt, leading to resource exhaustion or other memory corruption issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker could create a malicious NetScreen capture file with a negative value for packet length. When a user opens this file in Wireshark, the vulnerability is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed NetScreen capture file.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious capture file with a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was fixed by reverting the `pkt_len` variable to be signed (int), using `%d` in `sscanf` and adding a check to verify if the scanned value was negative. The packet length is also now checked against `WTAP_MAX_PACKET_SIZE` before memory is allocated.
*   The issue was reported by iDefense Labs.
*   The vulnerability is present in Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.3 and 1.12.0 to 1.12.11.
*   It is fixed in versions 2.0.4 and 1.12.12.
