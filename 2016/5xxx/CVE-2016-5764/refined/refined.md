{
  "CVE-ID": "CVE-2016-5764",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Rumba FTP client is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow due to improper handling of long directory names received from a malicious FTP server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
     "impact": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the connected client by sending a long directory name, which overwrites the stack, specifically the SEH (Structured Exception Handler) and NSEH (Next SEH) records. While the provided proof of concept only overwrites these records, it indicates a pathway to arbitrary code execution by controlling these pointers.",
    "attack_vectors": {
       "vector_details": "A malicious FTP server sends a crafted long directory name in response to a PWD command which overwrites the stack on the client when processing the response.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to set up a malicious FTP server and have a user connect to it using the vulnerable Rumba FTP client.",
       "required_attacker_position": "The attacker needs to have a server accessible to the targeted client."
      }
   }
