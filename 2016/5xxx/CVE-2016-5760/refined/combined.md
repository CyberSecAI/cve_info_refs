# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

=======================================================================
              title: Multiple vulnerabilities
            product: Micro Focus GroupWise
 vulnerable version: GroupWise 2014 R2 (<=SP1)
                     GroupWise 2014
                     (unsupported versions may be affected)
      fixed version: GroupWise 2014 R2 Service Pack 1 Hot Patch 1

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Micro Focus GroupWise is a complete collaboration software solution that
provides email, calendaring, instant messaging, task management, contact and
document management functions. GroupWise has long been praised by customers and
industry watchers for its security and reliability."

URL: <https://www.novell.com/products/groupwise/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a quick security check SEC Consult found three vulnerabilities in the
Micro Focus GroupWise server applications.

As these partly critical vulnerabilities were identified during a short time
frame SEC Consult recommends to conduct a thorough technical security audit.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected cross site scripting in the administrator console (CVE-2016-5760)
Two reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified in the
gwadmin-console application. An attacker could potentially take over an
administrator's session.

2) Persistent cross site scripting via emails (CVE-2016-5761)
By sending a single email to a victim an attacker could take over the victim's
email account. For a successful exploitation the victim has to click on a
link in an email opened in GroupWise WebAccess.

3) Heap-based Buffer Overflow / Integer Overflow (CVE-2016-5762)
By sending a crafted value for the username or the password to GroupWise
WebAccess or the GroupWise Post Office Agent during login an attacker can
overwrite heap memory. In order to exploit this vulnerability no user
authentication is required.
PLEASE NOTE: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an
attacker to execute code remotely. As SEC Consult only conducted a very quick
security check this has not been verified.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected cross site scripting in the administrator console
The following links demonstrate reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities:

<https://testhost:9710/gwadmin-console/install/login.jsp?token=asdf%22%2balert%28%27xss%27%29%2b%22>
<https://testhost:9710/gwadmin-console/index.jsp#poa:%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert%28%27xss%27%29%3E>

2) Persistent cross site scripting via emails
The following Python fragment demonstrates the generation of a hyperlink that,
when embeded into an HTML email, would, upon clicking it, open a new mail dialog.

---- snip ----
msg = """
<a
href="javascript:top.opener.document.getElementById(String.fromCharCode($charcode)).firstChild.firstChild.click()"
target = _self>click me</a>
""".replace('$charcode', ','.join(str(ord(x)) for x in list('idNewPopupMenu')))
---- snip ----

3) Heap-based Buffer Overflow / Integer Overflow
When a username or password longer than 65332 (2^16 - 3) is specified, an
overflow causes the Post Office Agent to allocate too little memory.

The following pseudocode shows how the memory to be allocated is calculated
based on the input length.

((uint16_t) ((<length>) + 3) & 0xFFFC) + 1)

Therefore, a value of 65533 would cause the application to allocate 1 byte. By
modifying this value accordingly, an attacker can cause the application to
allocate an arbitrary amount of memory.

The user-specified value is then copied into this buffer until a NUL-byte is
reached. This allows an attacker to write non-NUL bytes after the allocated
heap chunk.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The version 2014 R2 SP1 of Micro Focus GroupWise was found to be
vulnerable. This version was the latest version at the time of the discovery.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2016-07-05: Contacting vendor through security () novell com
2016-07-06: Micro Focus was able to reproduce the vulnerabilities
2016-07-25: Micro Focus: The issues have been resolved in development
2016-08-12: Micro Focus: Hotpatch is currently undergoing QA
2016-08-25: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The "GroupWise 2014 R2 Service Pack 1 Hot Patch 1" should be applied
immediately. This update can be found at:
