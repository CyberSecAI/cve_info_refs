Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5760:

**1. Verification:**

   The provided content explicitly mentions **CVE-2016-5760** as a "Reflected cross site scripting in the administrator console". This aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user input within the GroupWise administration console. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Two instances of reflected XSS were identified in the `gwadmin-console` application. This means the malicious script is injected into the application's response and executed by the victim's browser.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking/Compromise:** An attacker could potentially take over an administrator's session by tricking them into clicking a specially crafted link.
*   **Browser-Based Attacks:** Successful exploitation could enable further browser-based attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized actions within the application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Links:** The attack vector involves creating malicious URLs that, when clicked by an authenticated administrator, execute injected JavaScript code within their browser session. These URLs are crafted to contain malicious JavaScript code within parameters like `token` in `login.jsp` or within the fragment identifier of `index.jsp`.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to employ social engineering tactics to get a legitimate administrator user to click on the crafted link.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker must be capable of creating URLs containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to trick a legitimate administrator into clicking the crafted link.
*   **Target is authenticated user:** The attacker needs to target an administrator that is logged into the Groupwise Admin console for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by including specially crafted JavaScript within parameters of the admin console URLs. Examples provided:
    *   `<https://testhost:9710/gwadmin-console/install/login.jsp?token=asdf%22%2balert%28%27xss%27%29%2b%22>`
    *   `<https://testhost:9710/gwadmin-console/index.jsp#poa:%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert%28%27xss%27%29%3E>`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Wolfgang Ettlinger of SEC Consult.
