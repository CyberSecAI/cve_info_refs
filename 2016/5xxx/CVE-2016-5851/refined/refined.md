Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2016-5851 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) attack
*   **Affected Software:** python-docx package versions prior to 0.8.6
*   **Root Cause:** The python-docx package was vulnerable to XML External Entity attacks (XXE) due to allowing XML entity expansion. Resolving entities in the XML is not required by the Open XML standard.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.8.6 by disallowing XML entity expansion.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious XML string containing an external entity definition and including it within a docx file, an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server. The provided PoC demonstrates reading `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to modify a docx file to insert the malicious XML. The application using python-docx must then process this crafted file.
