Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `/spywall/new_whitelist.php` script of Symantec Web Gateway. Specifically, the script fails to properly validate the `white_ip` POST parameter when the `sid` POST parameter is set to a non-zero value, bypassing input validation and allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary values into the `$url` variable of the `add_whitelist()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary operating system commands due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `$url` parameter before passing it to the `syscall()` function, which executes the command with `sudo` and thus as root privileges.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability is made possible because the input validation for the `white_ip` parameter is bypassed when a non-zero `sid` parameter is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with root privileges on the Symantec Web Gateway appliance. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/spywall/new_whitelist.php` script. The request must contain:
    *   A non-zero value for the `sid` parameter.
    *   A malicious string for the `white_ip` parameter that contains the OS command to be executed.
*   The attacker must have an account with read-write permissions (POLICY\_LEVEL) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Symantec Web Gateway appliance.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with read-write permissions (POLICY\_LEVEL) on the vulnerable system.
