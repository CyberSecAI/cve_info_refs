Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5282:

**Summary:** This CVE addresses a vulnerability in Firefox for Android where arbitrary content could request favicons from non-whitelisted schemes (like "jar:jar:"). This could lead to the loading of arbitrary content from the browser's JAR file.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the `LoadFaviconTask.downloadFavicon` function in the Android version of Firefox. This function had a special case for "jar:jar:" schemes, which allowed loading favicons directly from the JAR file. The issue was that this check was performed before validating if the content was privileged or not. Thus, it allowed untrusted web content to request resources from the JAR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Handling of "jar:jar:" Schemes:** The code prioritized processing of `jar:jar:` schemes over security checks, allowing access to potentially sensitive resources within the browser's JAR file from untrusted web content.
*   **Lack of Privilege Separation:** The Java code did not enforce proper separation between privileged chrome pages and untrusted web content. This allowed untrusted content to make requests intended for privileged contexts.
*   **Missing Whitelist:** The system did not have a proper mechanism to whitelist what type of schemes could be loaded as favicon based on the context (privileged or not).
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:** While the immediate impact was a crash, the ability to load arbitrary content from the JAR file could be used to disclose sensitive information from the JAR.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Resource Loading:** A malicious website could force the browser to load arbitrary content from its JAR file, leading to potential unexpected behavior.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary exploit vector, attempting to load very large or invalid content from the JAR could cause the browser to crash (as originally reported).
*   **Potential Code Execution:** Although not explicitly demonstrated in the bug report, the vulnerability could lead to code execution by potentially crafting a malicious resource within the JAR.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker would host a webpage that includes an invalid `jar:jar:` url for favicon.
*   **Drag and drop (secondary):** A user dragging a file with a crafted favicon tag on a site can lead to the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker only needs to serve the crafted html page.
*   **Network access:** The attacker should be able to serve the malicious website

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by introducing a privilege check before attempting to load a favicon. If the page was not a privileged chrome page, then the browser would not load favicons with schemes other than http and https.
Specifically, the fix included:
* Differentiating between privileged and unprivileged favicon loading.
* Adding a whitelist for CHROMEUI pages, which are allowed to load JAR files.
* Restricting unprivileged pages to only load HTTP/HTTPS favicons.
