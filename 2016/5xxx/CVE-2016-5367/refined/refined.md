**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient parameter verification in the Huawei Honor routers which can lead to the display of sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the leakage of sensitive information. This could be leveraged by an attacker to perform further attacks such as file injection and modification of configuration data.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to connect to the LAN of the router through a LAN port or a Wi-Fi connection. After connecting to the router through an open port, the sensitive information can be displayed.
