- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary Java code through the deserialization of a malicious object from untrusted sources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted serialized Java object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious serialized object to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server instance. The attacker needs low privileges.
