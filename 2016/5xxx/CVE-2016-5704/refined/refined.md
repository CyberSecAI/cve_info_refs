Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of table comments displayed on the table structure page. Specifically, the `TABLE_COMMENT` variable was not being properly escaped before being outputted to the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. Malicious code can be injected into the `TABLE_COMMENT` field in the database. When this comment is displayed on the table structure page, the injected code will be executed in the user's browser, allowing an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the phpMyAdmin web application. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing user cookies)
    *   Defacement of the phpMyAdmin interface
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing unauthorized actions within the phpMyAdmin application, potentially including data manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the database itself. An attacker would need to modify the `TABLE_COMMENT` field of a database table.
*   The injected code is executed when a user views the structure of the affected table in phpMyAdmin

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker requires write access to the MySQL database to modify the `TABLE_COMMENT`. This could be due to compromised database credentials or other application vulnerabilities that allow for database modification.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All phpMyAdmin 4.6.x versions prior to 4.6.3 are affected.
*   **Solution:** Upgrading to phpMyAdmin 4.6.3 or newer, or applying the provided patch, resolves the vulnerability.
*   **Patch:** The fix involved using `htmlspecialchars()` to properly escape the `TABLE_COMMENT` variable before outputting it to the page.
*  **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-661, which is related to insufficient sanitization.
