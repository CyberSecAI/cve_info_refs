- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is based on a reflected XSS vulnerability, meaning that the malicious script is injected into the application through a user-supplied input (e.g., in a URL or form) and then reflected back to the user within the application's response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or form submissions that include JavaScript payloads. The attacker would need to convince a user to interact with this malicious URL or data to trigger the XSS attack. The user must be logged into an affected IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform instance.
