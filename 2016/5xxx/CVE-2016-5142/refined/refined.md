  "CVE-2016-5142": {
    "description": "The Web Cryptography API (aka WebCrypto) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, does not properly copy data buffers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code, related to NormalizeAlgorithm.cpp and SubtleCrypto.cpp.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of data buffer copies within the Web Cryptography API implementation.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect data buffer management."
      ],
       "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a use-after-free condition. There's also a possibility of other unspecified impacts, suggesting potential for more severe exploits like arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by visiting a webpage with malicious Javascript code."
