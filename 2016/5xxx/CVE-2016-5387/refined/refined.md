Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-5387:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Apache HTTP Server (httpd) improperly uses the value of the `Proxy` header from HTTP requests to initialize the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable for CGI scripts. This is a name collision issue where the `Proxy` header from a request becomes the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable used for outgoing proxy settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper handling of HTTP headers:** Apache httpd sets the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable based on a user-supplied `Proxy` header in HTTP requests.
*  **Reliance on user-supplied data:**  CGI scripts and libraries incorrectly use `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable for setting up outgoing proxy requests, assuming it is intended for that purpose and not user-controlled data
*  **Lack of input validation**: Apache HTTPD does not filter or validate the Proxy header value before setting it as an environment variable.
*   **Name collision:** The standard CGI meta-variable naming convention results in a collision between a request header and an environment variable intended to store system proxy settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Redirection of outgoing requests**: A remote attacker can send a malicious HTTP request containing a `Proxy` header. If the webserver processes this header without proper sanitization and passes this to CGI scripts as `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable.  The vulnerable CGI script will then forward its outgoing HTTP requests to the attacker-controlled proxy server specified in the crafted request.
*  **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** By redirecting requests through an attacker-controlled proxy, the attacker can intercept, view, and potentially manipulate sensitive information in the outgoing HTTP requests and the responses.
*   **Data tampering/manipulation:** Attackers may alter the content of the responses or introduce malformed data to cause unexpected behavior in the application.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** Attackers might hold connections open via their controlled proxy, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A remote attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a `Proxy` header containing the attacker's proxy address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to set up and control a proxy server.

**Additional notes:**

*   This vulnerability affects CGI applications, specifically when they process HTTP requests and then generate new ones, relying on the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable.
*   The issue was found to be widespread, affecting multiple software projects and implementations of CGI.
*   The vulnerability is also described as "httpoxy" in some of the provided content.
*   Patches include not only updates to Apache httpd, but also other software such as Tomcat, PHP, and Python implementations that are susceptible to misusing the `HTTP_PROXY` variable.
*   Mitigations involve stripping the `Proxy` header from incoming requests before the server passes them to CGI scripts, or to update HTTP clients not to use HTTP_PROXY if not on a command-line interpreter (CLI).
*   Red Hat's fix for this involves no longer passing the `Proxy` header via the `HTTP_PROXY` variable to scripts.
*  Some software (ex: Ruby's LWP::HTTP) avoid the `HTTP_PROXY` variable for CGI requests, and use a different `CGI_HTTP_PROXY` to avoid conflicts.
*   CVSS scores vary due to different analyses and impact of exploitability on different products.
*   Several vendors have released patches or workarounds, including Apache, Red Hat, Debian, SUSE, and Ubuntu.
