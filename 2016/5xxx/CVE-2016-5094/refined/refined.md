Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5094:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `php_html_entities()` function within PHP. This function converts characters to their HTML entity equivalents, and under certain conditions, the calculation of the new string length could result in an integer overflow, leading to a negative length value. When a negative length value is then passed to `RETVAL_STRINGL`, it results in a corrupted string-typed ZVAL (Zend Value).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the integer overflow in the length calculation. The `new_len` variable, a `size_t`, is cast to a signed integer (int) without proper bounds checking.
*   **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The resulting negative length value from the integer overflow causes `RETVAL_STRINGL` to allocate memory incorrectly based on this invalid length, leading to a memory corruption issue and other undefined behavior.
*   **Use of `free()` instead of `efree()`:** In `phar_extract_file()`, `new_state.cwd` is allocated with the Zend memory allocator but is freed later using `free` instead of `efree` when `php_stream_mkdir` fails. This leads to double free/heap corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** A crafted input string can trigger the integer overflow, leading to a corrupted string-typed ZVAL.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** In the context of Phar archives, if `cwd` is user-controlled, the invalid `free()` could potentially result in code execution. The incorrect usage of `free()` when a failure occurs in `php_stream_mkdir`  can corrupt the heap.
*   **Application Instability/Crash:** Various functions dealing with a corrupted string could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered when processing HTML entities, specifically within the `htmlspecialchars()` function, given a long string with many ampersands.
*   The use of crafted Phar archives is another attack vector. Specifically, extracting a Zip-based Phar archive to a directory that contains a file of the same name as a directory to be extracted triggers this vulnerability.
*   Use after free can also be triggered via `unserialize()` on user provided data.
* The `php_html_entities()` function and associated memory corruption can be triggered via several PHP functions, such as  `htmlspecialchars`, `filter_var`, `add_string_to_string`, `defined`, `class_exists`, `function_exists`, `trigger_error`, `date_default_timezone_set`, `hash_init`, `date`, `gmdate`, `collator_create`, `normalizer_normalize`, or `grapheme_strlen`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to supply a specially crafted string to a vulnerable PHP application that is passed to `htmlspecialchars()` or trigger `php_html_entities` by other ways. This could be through a web form, URL parameters, or through other means of user input.
* An attacker would need to be able to supply a specially crafted Phar archive, which is then processed by a vulnerable PHP application.
* An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious serialized object via an interface exposed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in PHP versions 5.6.22 and 7.0.7.
*   The affected code was introduced as a fix for [CVE-2015-6833](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-6833) ([bug 1283702](show_bug.cgi?id=1283702 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2015-6833 php: Files from archive can be extracted outside of destination directory using phar")).
*   The vulnerability was fixed upstream in versions PHP 5.6.23.

In summary, CVE-2016-5094 represents an integer overflow vulnerability in PHP's HTML entity handling that could be exploited to cause memory corruption, crashes, and potential code execution when processing specifically crafted inputs or Phar archives, especially when the memory limit of a script is not enforced.
