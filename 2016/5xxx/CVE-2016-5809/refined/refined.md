Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the web interface of Schneider Electric IONXXXX series power meters. Specifically, there is no CSRF token generated to authenticate the user during a session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to craft malicious web pages that, when visited by an authenticated user, will cause the user's browser to send unauthorized requests to the vulnerable power meter, leading to configuration changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to make unauthorized configuration changes to the power meter. This can have various impacts, potentially disrupting the monitoring and control of power systems. The advisory notes that the unauthorized user can access the device management portal and make configuration changes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, making it accessible to attackers over a network.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage, or otherwise trigger the user's browser to make a crafted request to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill:** The exploit is deemed relatively easy, requiring only low skill for an attacker to carry out.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the targeted power meter.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to involve an authenticated user in some way to trigger the CSRF attack (e.g., via a malicious web page).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Exploit-DB entry includes proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrating how the CSRF vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The vulnerability is also related to CVE-2016-5815, which is an improper access control vulnerability due to the lack of default authentication, as stated in the provided content.
*   The vulnerability was present in a range of Schneider Electric IONXXXX series power meters including ION73XX, ION75XX, ION76XX, ION8650, ION8800, and PM5XXX series.
