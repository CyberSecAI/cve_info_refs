{
  "cveId": "CVE-2016-5312",
  "description": "A charting component in the Symantec Messaging Gateway control center does not properly sanitize user input submitted for charting requests. This could potentially result in an authorized but less privileged user gaining access to paths outside the authorized directory. This could potentially provide read access to some files/directories on the server for which the user is not authorized.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user input passed to the charting component in the Symantec Messaging Gateway control center.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An authorized but less privileged user can gain unauthorized read access to files and directories on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
    "attackVectors": {
      "vector": "By manipulating the 'sn' parameter in the charting request, an attacker can perform a directory traversal attack.",
       "requiredCapabilities": "An authorized but less privileged user needs to submit a crafted charting request with a malicious 'sn' parameter."
    },
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability resides within the `kavachart-kcServlet-5.3.2.jar` package, specifically in the `com/ve/kavachart/servlet/ChartStream.java` file. The 'sn' parameter is taken from the request and used directly to retrieve a byte array from the servlet context, without sanitization, which allows for directory traversal using '..'."
