- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Demo package on the Web is vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue, where a specially crafted DLL can be placed in the victim's path. When the installer is executed, it loads the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the path where the installer is searching for DLL files. The user then needs to execute the installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the appropriate path on the victim's system and needs the user to execute the installer.
