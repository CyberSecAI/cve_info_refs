Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5838:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from "less secure `sanitize_file_name` edge cases." This indicates that the function responsible for sanitizing filenames before they are used within the application did not properly handle certain input scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Filename Sanitization:** The `sanitize_file_name` function had edge cases that were not properly handled. This could allow for unexpected characters or sequences within filenames after sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The specific impact of this vulnerability is not detailed in the provided documents. However, insecure filename sanitization can lead to several potential issues:
    *   **File System Manipulation:** Maliciously crafted filenames might allow attackers to manipulate the file system in unintended ways, such as creating files in unexpected locations or overwriting existing ones.
    *   **Code Execution:** In some cases, if filenames are passed to shell commands or other system functions without proper sanitization, it could lead to command injection or code execution vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service:** By crafting filenames that cause the system to enter an infinite loop or create an extremely large number of files, an attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service condition.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In cases where the filenames are displayed on the website without proper encoding, it may lead to XSS attacks. However, the document mentions other XSS vulnerabilities related to attachment names, and this vulnerability specifically relates to the sanitization of filenames, it is unclear if this specific vulnerability could also cause XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The vulnerability can be exploited when an attacker uploads a file with a specially crafted name.
*   **Any Function that utilizes the sanitize_file_name function:** Any code that handles or uses sanitized filenames may be a potential attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Upload Capability:** An attacker would need the ability to upload files to the WordPress application. This could be through user accounts with such permissions or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that provide such a capability.
*   **Knowledge of the sanitize_file_name function edge cases:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerabilities within the `sanitize_file_name` implementation and craft filenames that would bypass security checks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is not exhaustive, and further analysis of the `sanitize_file_name` implementation is needed to fully understand the severity and exploitability of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in WordPress version 4.5.3. Users of older versions are encouraged to update immediately.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the WordPress `sanitize_file_name` function which had edge cases that were not properly handled potentially leading to file system manipulation or code execution. An attacker with the capability to upload files could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted filenames. This vulnerability was fixed in WordPress version 4.5.3.
