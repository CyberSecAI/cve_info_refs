Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IBM Jazz Reporting Service (JRS) not properly restricting JSON serialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper control over JSON serialization, which allows for the exposure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information by sending a direct request to the server. The specific sensitive information that can be exposed is not detailed beyond "sensitive information"

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, involving a direct request to the vulnerable JRS service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. The attacker also requires some level of access to be able to send these direct requests. The vulnerability is exploitable with low privileges (PR:L) and does not require user interaction (UI:N).
