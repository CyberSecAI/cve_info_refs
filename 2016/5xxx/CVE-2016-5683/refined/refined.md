Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5683:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the `ReadyDesk.dll` file. This key is used to encrypt SQL Server user credentials stored in `SQL_Config.aspx`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321):** The application uses the same, static key for encryption, making decryption trivial if the key is exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker who obtains the encrypted password can easily decrypt it.
*   This decrypted password can then be used for further attacks, potentially gaining access to the database.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to obtain the encrypted password from `SQL_Config.aspx`.
*   The attacker also needs access to the `ReadyDesk.dll` file to extract the hard-coded key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable files (`SQL_Config.aspx` and `ReadyDesk.dll`) on the server. This may be achieved via other vulnerabilities like directory traversal (CVE-2016-5049).
