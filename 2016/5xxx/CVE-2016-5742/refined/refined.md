Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5742

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the XML-RPC interface of Movable Type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks via its XML-RPC interface. This means that an attacker can manipulate input data sent through the XML-RPC interface to inject malicious SQL code, which is then executed by the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify data within the database.
    - Potentially gain control over the database server, which could lead to a complete compromise of the application and underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XML-RPC Interface:** The attack vector is the XML-RPC interface of Movable Type. Attackers can send crafted XML-RPC requests containing malicious SQL code to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the XML-RPC interface of the Movable Type application. This usually means network connectivity to the server running Movable Type.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the XML-RPC interface or the ability to craft malicious requests that exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- Movable Type Pro 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x
- Movable Type Advanced 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x
- Movable Type 5.2.13 (GPLv2 licensed version)

**Mitigation:**
- The vendor released updated versions (6.2.6 and 6.1.3) to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade to the latest versions of Movable Type.

**Additional Details**
- A security researcher discovered the vulnerability and reported it to SixApart. The initial report was based on the 5.2.13 version of the code.
