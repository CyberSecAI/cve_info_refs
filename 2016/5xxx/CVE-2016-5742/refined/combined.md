This says:

>> susceptible to SQL injection attacks via XML-RPC interface.

>> AFFECTED VERSIONS OF MOVABLE TYPE

>>    Movable Type Pro 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x

Use CVE-2016-5742.

> 5.2.13.

Is there a separate public reference stating that 5.2.13 is affected?
Or, do you mean that you've done your own analysis and concluded
that 5.2.13 has the same vulnerability as 6.x? (Either one seems
fine, and wouldn't affect the number of CVE IDs - we are mostly
interested in linking the CVE to the primary-source reference about
the 5.2.13 vulnerability, if such a reference exists elsewhere.)

I sent the original vulnerability report to SixApart and based my report on the
5.2.13 version of the code.

Subject: CVE request: SQL injection in MovableType xml-rpc interface

Hi there,

SixApart just released new versions of MovableType 6.2 and 6.1 to fix an SQL
injection in the xml-rpc interface. The vulnerability also affects the older
GPLv2 licensed MovableType 5.2.13.

Could you please assign a CVE identifier for tracking this issue?
