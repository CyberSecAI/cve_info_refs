## Analysis of CVE-2016-5388

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5388:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The primary source of information regarding CVE-2016-5388 is the Red Hat Bugzilla entry for bug 1353809, and its linked references.
*   The vulnerability involves the Tomcat CGI servlet improperly setting an environment variable based on user input from the HTTP `Proxy` header.
*   Multiple sources mention `httpoxy` in conjunction with CVE-2016-5388, confirming this is the core vulnerability being discussed.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises because Tomcat's CGI servlet, when enabled, processes the `Proxy` header from incoming HTTP requests and automatically populates the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable with the header's value.
*   This behavior aligns with RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 that converts HTTP header field names to upper case and replaces "-" with "_" adding the prefix "HTTP\_".
*   The `HTTP_PROXY` variable is then used by some HTTP client implementations within CGI scripts to configure proxy settings for outgoing HTTP requests which will redirect those requests to an attacker-controlled proxy.
*   The root cause is the uncontrolled propagation of a user-supplied HTTP header value to a sensitive environment variable used by internal HTTP clients.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Input Propagation:** User-supplied data (the `Proxy` header) is directly used to set an environment variable.
*   **Implicit Trust:** Internal CGI scripts and HTTP client libraries trust the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Namespace Collision:** The naming conventions in RFC 3875 and the common use of `HTTP_PROXY` as a proxy configuration variable resulted in a vulnerable namespace collision.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** A remote attacker can redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view sensitive information present in the HTTP request.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify data in transit through the attacker-controlled proxy.
*   **Denial of Service:** Holding connections open can lead to a denial-of-service attack.
*   **Arbitrary Connection:** An attacker can force the vulnerable server to connect to an arbitrary address and port.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing a `Proxy` header to a vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   **HTTP Protocol:** The attack leverages the HTTP protocol, specifically by exploiting the `Proxy` header.
*   **CGI Environment:** The attack is effective against servers running in a CGI or CGI-like context.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of CGI Usage:** The attacker needs to know that the server uses the CGI servlet and that it makes outgoing HTTP connections.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Mitigation:** As a primary mitigation, it is recommended to drop or filter the `Proxy` request headers. Many vendors provided instructions on how to do this.
*   **Affected Products:** Apache Tomcat, Red Hat JBoss Web Server, and Oracle Linux are identified as being affected. The vulnerability is also applicable to other languages/frameworks such as PHP, Go and Python.
*   **Red Hat Fix:** Red Hat provided a fix to Tomcat, which prevents the `Proxy` request header from being used to populate the `HTTP_PROXY` variable.
*   **SUSE Fix:** SUSE addressed the vulnerability in Tomcat 6, 7 and 8, and stated that they do not believe that their products were ever vulnerable.
*  **Oracle Fix:** Oracle addressed this vulnerability in their July 2017 Critical Patch Update and provided patches for their affected products.

The provided text content does not explicitly describe a specific exploit or vulnerable configuration beyond a description of the affected environment (CGI-enabled Tomcat) and the attack vector (crafted HTTP `Proxy` header) but the bugzilla entries do provide links to code changes made to resolve the issue.
