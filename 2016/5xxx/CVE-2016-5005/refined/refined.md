Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5005

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input within the Apache Archiva application. Specifically, the `connector.sourceRepoId` HTTP POST parameter is not sanitized before being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application stores the unsanitized input in the database, which is then reflected on multiple admin pages when they are rendered, thus leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary script code into the administrative backend of Apache Archiva.
- This can be used to steal cookies, attack the browsers and their components of users visiting the page.
- The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to `/archiva/admin/addProxyConnector_commit.action`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `connector.sourceRepoId`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative rights to exploit the vulnerability through the web interface. The report also suggests that combining this vulnerability with CSRF (CVE-2016-4469) could increase the likelihood of exploitation, by tricking another administrator into triggering the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apache Archiva v1.3.9 and potentially older versions.
- The injected payload is reflected on the "Administration - Proxy Connectors" and the "Admin: Delete Proxy Connector" pages.
- A proof-of-concept is included to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The suggested solution is to upgrade to Apache Archiva 2.2.1.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSSv3 score of 5.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
