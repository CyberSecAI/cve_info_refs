... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_9.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, November 9, 2016

The stable channel has been updated to 54.0.2840.99 for Windows, 54.0.2840.98 for Mac, and 54.0.2840.100 on Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

## Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [4](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-3-M54) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$5000][[658114](https://crbug.com/658114)] High CVE-2016-5200: Out of bounds memory access in V8. Credit to Choongwoo Han
[$1000][[660678](https://crbug.com/660678)] Medium CVE-2016-5201: Info leak in extensions. Credit to Jann Horn

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[662843](https://crbug.com/662843)] CVE-2016-5202: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), or [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/54.0.2840.90..54.0.2840.100?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in [switching](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) release channels? Find out [how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

I could not reproduce the segfault with nodejs4 or nodejs6 using the POC code provided. (Node.js 7.0.0 does segfault with the code provided, but it was fixed with a V8 update in 7.2.0.)  From looking at the V8 source code for the respective versions, it seems that the older V8 versions do not attempt to (incorrectly) optimise the return value for Math.sign. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1009893#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2017-07-28 12:45:53 UTC  ``` good to hear, then we can close this ``` |  |
