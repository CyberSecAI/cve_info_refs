  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The libstorage and yast2-storage components were storing encryption passphrases in temporary files on disk instead of using stdin, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext storage of sensitive data (passphrases) in temporary files.",
      "Failure to remove temporary files after use."
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of encryption passphrases, potentially allowing unauthorized access to encrypted storage devices.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system's file system.",
      "Privilege escalation to gain access to the temporary files.",
      "Physical access to the storage device after a crash where temporary files might remain on disk"

      "Ability to access the file system where temporary files are stored.",

    "mitigating_factors": [
      "Full disk encryption or partial encryption covering the /tmp directory.",

    "fix_details": "The fix involves modifying the libstorage and yast2-storage components to pass encryption passphrases via stdin to cryptsetup, dmsetup or losetup instead of writing them to temporary files. Temporary files are not created with the fix. The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk.",
