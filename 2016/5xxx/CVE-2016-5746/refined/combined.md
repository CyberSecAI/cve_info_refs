| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-06-29 12:56:58 UTC  ``` libstorage stores passphrases for encrypted partitions/volumes in a temporary file on disk.  This is not an issue in a distribution installer situation, where tmpdir of the installer is not on permanent storage. However in an installed system, managing (opening, creating) any encrypted storage with libstorage / YaST2 writes the clear passphrases to disks.  This exposes current, past or even mistyped or unused passphrases for encrypted storage devices on permanent storage, as remnants of unlinked temporary files. In the case of a crash or termination of the process using libstorage, this is even kept as a file.  The attack vector is someone gaining access to the raw storage at any later point even if the encrypted storage is no longer mounted or present, either through privilege escalation or physical access.  /tmp/libstorage-XXXXXX is actually created with mode 700. /tmp/libstorage-XXXXXX/pwdf is created with mode 611.  Mitigating factors: * full disk encryption or partial encryption covering /tmp * /tmp on tempfs (modulo cold boot attack vectors)  Code locations:  The path used is getStorage()->tmpDir() + "/pwdf" The parent is created in Storage::initialize() e.g. /tmp/libstorage-XXXXXX  The passphrase for opening volumes and creating volumes is written to a temporary file in:  storage::Volums::detectEncyption() storage::Volume::doCryptsetup(bool readonly)  storage::Volume::doLosetup()  It is passed to  storage::Volume::getCryptsetupCmd() where a cryptsetup command is constructed in which the pwdf file is used as a keyfile. The command is executed by callers of getCryptsetupCmd()  The temporary file is overwritten for subsequent  The temporary is not removed until the destrucor Storage::~Storage() is called.   Consideration:  cryptsetup {luksOpen,luksFormat} (and the dm equivalents used elsewhere) have the option to read key material from stdin, which should be preferred over the solution described. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-06-29 22:00:25 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-06-30 09:11:00 UTC  ``` CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk Assigning CVE-2016-5746 Rating CVSS v2 4.7 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c6)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-07 08:26:52 UTC  ``` Making public.  Note that a past exposure of key material (dm: key; LUKS: key slot passphrase) is not addressed by a code fix or maintenance update alone.  Corrective action may also also include, e.g. for LUKS: * re-encrypt the affected storage if required. Note that this is different from changing the passphrase. This is due the structure of the LUKS header with one or more passphrases protecting the single master key. * consider any LUKS header back-ups corresponding to a key slot passphrase used previously * changing passphrases re-used elsewhere  Mitigating factors: * full disk encryption or partial encryption covering /tmp * /tmp on tmpfs (modulo cold boot attack vectors) ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c7)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 14:27:53 UTC  ``` Patch against SLE-12 SP2:  <https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage/pull/161> ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c8)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 14:55:07 UTC  ``` Test procedure 1: Crypto file in installed system =================================================  - Build and install libstorage with the above patch.  - Start YaST expert partitioner with that libstorage;   create a crypto file there:    - In the "System View" tree on the left, select "Crypt Files"    - Click "Add Crypt File" button   - Enter "/tmp/crypto-01" in the "Path Name of Loop File" field   - Check "Create Loop File"   - Click "Next" button    - Enter "/crypto-01" in the "Mount Point" field   - Click "Next" button    - Enter a password in the next dialog   - Enter the same password again in the second password field   - Click "Next" button    -> The "Crypt Files" table should now have an entry like this:       /dev/mapper/cr_crypto-01  50.00 MiB  XFS  /crypto-01 *    - Click "Next"   button to see the changes summary   - Click "Finish" button to execute the changes    -> There should now be a new crypted file system mounted on /crypto-01       mount | grep crypt       /dev/mapper/cr_crypto-01 on /crypto-01 type xfs ...      cat /etc/crypttab      cr_crypto-01    /tmp/crypto-01       none       none      ls -l /dev/mapper     total 0     crw------- 1 root root 10, 236 Jul  6 14:22 control     lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       7 Jul 13 16:39 cr_crypto-01 -> ../dm-0   - Create one or more test files on the new crypted file system:    cd /crypto-01   echo "echo "Kilroy was here" >test.txt   - Unmount and close the crypto file:    umount /crypto-01   cryptsetup luksClose cr_crypto-01    ls -l /dev/mapper   total 0   crw------- 1 root root 10, 236 Jul  6 14:22 control    sudo dmsetup table   No devices found  - Open and mount it manually:    cryptsetup luksOpen /tmp/crypto-01 cr_crypto-01   Enter passphrase for /tmp/crypto-01:    ...   mount /dev/mapper/cr_crypto-01 /crypto-01   - Check contents:    ls -l /crypto-01    total 4   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 16 Jul 13 16:44 test.txt    cat /crypto-01/test.txt    Kilroy was here   - Clean up: Close and unmount again    umount /crypto-01   cryptsetup luksClose cr_crypto-01  - Remove the entry from /etc/crypttab   (or delete that file if that was the only entry)  - Remove mount point    rmdir /crypto-01  - Remove entry from /etc/fstab ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c9)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 15:30:52 UTC  ``` Creating an ISO with the patched libstorage for the target code stream ======================================================================  - Build RPMs with the patched libstorage for the target code stream  - Create a driver update disk (DUD) with those RPMs:    cd ~/space/rpms   rm -f *.rpm   osc -A ibs getbinaries -d . home:shundhammer:storage libstorage \     SLE_12_SP1 x86_64    libstorage-devel-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm             100%    libstorage-python-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm            100%    libstorage-ruby-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm              100%    libstorage-testsuite-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm         100%    libstorage7-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm                  100%      rm libstorage-testsuite*.rpm    mkdud -c ../iso/pipe-pw.dud --dist sles12 --obs-keys libstorage*.rpm   - Integrate that DUD into the installation DVD:    mksusecd --create SLE-12-SP2-patched-DVD1.iso --initrd \     pipe-pw.dud \     SLE-12-SP2-Server-DVD-x86_64-Beta4-DVD1.iso ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c10)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 15:39:45 UTC  ``` Test procedure 2: Installation with crypted LVM ===============================================  This tests if the new password handling is compatible to the old one:   - Start an installation (QEMU or VirtualBox) with the original (unpatched!)

Backport to SLE-12 SP1

This backport is easy because both affected classes (SystemCmd and Volume) were unchanged between SP1 and SP2, so the diffs for this fix are identical.

Sorry, something went wrong.

No, that just enables getting notifications when data is available for any of them. The file descriptors still remain separate.

### @shundhammer **[shundhammer](/shundhammer)** commented [Aug 31, 2016](#issue-174306367)

Backport to SLE-10 SP3.

Yet another largely hand-made backport since many things were changed (again) between SLE-10 SP3 and SLE-11 SP1.

SLE-11 SP1 PR for comparison:

[#226](https://github.com/yast/yast-storage/pull/226)

I tested this with RPMs and DUD and ISO etc.; only this time there was no way to create an encrypted LVM during installation, so the real test had to take place in the installed system: Leave some unpartitioned space on the disk and use that space later in the installed system with the expert partitioner to create a new partition with an encrypted ext2 or ReiserFS.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-06-29 12:56:58 UTC  ``` libstorage stores passphrases for encrypted partitions/volumes in a temporary file on disk.  This is not an issue in a distribution installer situation, where tmpdir of the installer is not on permanent storage. However in an installed system, managing (opening, creating) any encrypted storage with libstorage / YaST2 writes the clear passphrases to disks.  This exposes current, past or even mistyped or unused passphrases for encrypted storage devices on permanent storage, as remnants of unlinked temporary files. In the case of a crash or termination of the process using libstorage, this is even kept as a file.  The attack vector is someone gaining access to the raw storage at any later point even if the encrypted storage is no longer mounted or present, either through privilege escalation or physical access.  /tmp/libstorage-XXXXXX is actually created with mode 700. /tmp/libstorage-XXXXXX/pwdf is created with mode 611.  Mitigating factors: * full disk encryption or partial encryption covering /tmp * /tmp on tempfs (modulo cold boot attack vectors)  Code locations:  The path used is getStorage()->tmpDir() + "/pwdf" The parent is created in Storage::initialize() e.g. /tmp/libstorage-XXXXXX  The passphrase for opening volumes and creating volumes is written to a temporary file in:  storage::Volums::detectEncyption() storage::Volume::doCryptsetup(bool readonly)  storage::Volume::doLosetup()  It is passed to  storage::Volume::getCryptsetupCmd() where a cryptsetup command is constructed in which the pwdf file is used as a keyfile. The command is executed by callers of getCryptsetupCmd()  The temporary file is overwritten for subsequent  The temporary is not removed until the destrucor Storage::~Storage() is called.   Consideration:  cryptsetup {luksOpen,luksFormat} (and the dm equivalents used elsewhere) have the option to read key material from stdin, which should be preferred over the solution described. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-06-29 22:00:25 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-06-30 09:11:00 UTC  ``` CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk Assigning CVE-2016-5746 Rating CVSS v2 4.7 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c6)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-07 08:26:52 UTC  ``` Making public.  Note that a past exposure of key material (dm: key; LUKS: key slot passphrase) is not addressed by a code fix or maintenance update alone.  Corrective action may also also include, e.g. for LUKS: * re-encrypt the affected storage if required. Note that this is different from changing the passphrase. This is due the structure of the LUKS header with one or more passphrases protecting the single master key. * consider any LUKS header back-ups corresponding to a key slot passphrase used previously * changing passphrases re-used elsewhere  Mitigating factors: * full disk encryption or partial encryption covering /tmp * /tmp on tmpfs (modulo cold boot attack vectors) ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c7)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 14:27:53 UTC  ``` Patch against SLE-12 SP2:  <https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage/pull/161> ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c8)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 14:55:07 UTC  ``` Test procedure 1: Crypto file in installed system =================================================  - Build and install libstorage with the above patch.  - Start YaST expert partitioner with that libstorage;   create a crypto file there:    - In the "System View" tree on the left, select "Crypt Files"    - Click "Add Crypt File" button   - Enter "/tmp/crypto-01" in the "Path Name of Loop File" field   - Check "Create Loop File"   - Click "Next" button    - Enter "/crypto-01" in the "Mount Point" field   - Click "Next" button    - Enter a password in the next dialog   - Enter the same password again in the second password field   - Click "Next" button    -> The "Crypt Files" table should now have an entry like this:       /dev/mapper/cr_crypto-01  50.00 MiB  XFS  /crypto-01 *    - Click "Next"   button to see the changes summary   - Click "Finish" button to execute the changes    -> There should now be a new crypted file system mounted on /crypto-01       mount | grep crypt       /dev/mapper/cr_crypto-01 on /crypto-01 type xfs ...      cat /etc/crypttab      cr_crypto-01    /tmp/crypto-01       none       none      ls -l /dev/mapper     total 0     crw------- 1 root root 10, 236 Jul  6 14:22 control     lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       7 Jul 13 16:39 cr_crypto-01 -> ../dm-0   - Create one or more test files on the new crypted file system:    cd /crypto-01   echo "echo "Kilroy was here" >test.txt   - Unmount and close the crypto file:    umount /crypto-01   cryptsetup luksClose cr_crypto-01    ls -l /dev/mapper   total 0   crw------- 1 root root 10, 236 Jul  6 14:22 control    sudo dmsetup table   No devices found  - Open and mount it manually:    cryptsetup luksOpen /tmp/crypto-01 cr_crypto-01   Enter passphrase for /tmp/crypto-01:    ...   mount /dev/mapper/cr_crypto-01 /crypto-01   - Check contents:    ls -l /crypto-01    total 4   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 16 Jul 13 16:44 test.txt    cat /crypto-01/test.txt    Kilroy was here   - Clean up: Close and unmount again    umount /crypto-01   cryptsetup luksClose cr_crypto-01  - Remove the entry from /etc/crypttab   (or delete that file if that was the only entry)  - Remove mount point    rmdir /crypto-01  - Remove entry from /etc/fstab ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c9)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 15:30:52 UTC  ``` Creating an ISO with the patched libstorage for the target code stream ======================================================================  - Build RPMs with the patched libstorage for the target code stream  - Create a driver update disk (DUD) with those RPMs:    cd ~/space/rpms   rm -f *.rpm   osc -A ibs getbinaries -d . home:shundhammer:storage libstorage \     SLE_12_SP1 x86_64    libstorage-devel-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm             100%    libstorage-python-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm            100%    libstorage-ruby-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm              100%    libstorage-testsuite-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm         100%    libstorage7-2.26.4-2.1.x86_64.rpm                  100%      rm libstorage-testsuite*.rpm    mkdud -c ../iso/pipe-pw.dud --dist sles12 --obs-keys libstorage*.rpm   - Integrate that DUD into the installation DVD:    mksusecd --create SLE-12-SP2-patched-DVD1.iso --initrd \     pipe-pw.dud \     SLE-12-SP2-Server-DVD-x86_64-Beta4-DVD1.iso ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=986971#c10)  Stefan Hundhammer   2016-07-13 15:39:45 UTC  ``` Test procedure 2: Installation with crypted LVM ===============================================  This tests if the new password handling is compatible to the old one:   - Start an installation (QEMU or VirtualBox) with the original (unpatched!)

### @shundhammer **[shundhammer](/shundhammer)** commented [Jul 14, 2016](#issue-165596823)

Backport to SLE-12 GA.

This is a more complex backport. This should be the base for all earlier versions of libstorage where both affected classes (SystemCmd and Volume) were still formatted in the old style and had some "Hungarian Notation" style variables.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### @shundhammer **[shundhammer](/shundhammer)** commented [Aug 22, 2016](#issue-172409464)

Backport to SLE-11 SP4.

This is very close (but not exactly the same) as the backport to SLE-12 GA. Prior to SLE-12 GA, libstorage was part of the yast2-storage package, thus the different package name here.

Also, in that version there were considerably less constants defined for all kinds of external tools; they were all over the place in the code. This is why the SLE-12 GA patch did not apply cleanly in Volume.cc and Volume.h.

SLE-12 GA patch for comparison:

[openSUSE/libstorage#163](https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage/pull/163)

*Please notice that this pull request is strictly about the patch being equivalent to the ones for SLE-12 GA and SLE-12 SP1. I tried to keep the patch as minimalistic as possible, so please let's avoid style discussions. The patch is tested and proven to work for SLE-12 GA and SP1.*

Sorry, something went wrong.

Well, in principle, yes; it's a matter of habit to keep useful debugging code (albeit commented out) in case it's useful in the future again for any debugging.

Backport to SLE-11 SP1.

Since there were a lot of changes between SP1 and SP3, the SP3/SP4 patch did not apply at all, so this is very much a manual effort.

Still, it is quite straightforward to compare this PR manually to the PR against SP4:

<https://github.com/yast/yast-storage/pull/223/files>

I also created RPMs in the IBS with this version, built a DUD, integrated that DUD into the SLES-11-SP1 ISO and tested with that ISO: It installs without problem, and the created encrypted LVM can successfully be decrypted so that system boots without any problems.

Sorry, something went wrong.

NP (I wouldn't change already tested code for this): the original patch used "close (stdin) child failer errno", which is probably convenient for easily distinguish from the error closing sout below.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Right, but I wanted to keep it as similar to the surrounding code as possible -- and there it's similarly impossible to tell which close() went wrong - stdout or stderr? Now it's one more to guess from. But when that happens, something went badly wrong already, so it's just cosmetic which of those close() calls failed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I have compared it to the <https://github.com/yast/yast-storage/pull/223/files> change and nothing was forgotten. So again, small LGTM from me 😉 |
