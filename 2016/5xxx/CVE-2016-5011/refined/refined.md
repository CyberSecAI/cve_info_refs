Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-5011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `libblkid` library of the `util-linux` package. It stems from how the library parses Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables, specifically when dealing with Extended Boot Record (EBR) partitions. If an EBR points to an offset of 0, the library can enter an infinite loop when parsing the partition table, attempting to recursively parse the same block repeatedly as if it were an EBR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite loop:** The core issue is that the `libblkid` library doesn't handle a specially crafted MBR where an extended partition references LBA 0, leading to an infinite loop. This is due to a missing check for the offset being zero
*  **Inadequate validation:** The parsing logic lacks a check to prevent recursion when encountering a zero-offset extended partition record.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The infinite loop consumes system resources (CPU, memory), causing the affected system to become unresponsive.
*  **System Unresponsiveness:** The excessive device node generation can lead to the system becoming unresponsive and potentially cause an out of memory condition in some cases.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attack vector involves an attacker with physical access to a target system. They must have the ability to insert a storage device with a malicious MBR partition table.
*   **Local User:** A local, unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability by attaching a specially crafted storage device with the malicious MBR partition table to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access to the Target Machine:** The attacker needs physical access to the machine to insert the malicious storage device.
*   **Crafted MBR:** The attacker must have a storage device that has been modified with a specially crafted MBR containing an extended partition entry that points to a starting LBA of 0.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during partition table parsing, notably when system services such as `systemd-udevd` interact with the inserted storage device.
*   The bug was reported to Red Hat by Michael Gruhn, with original discovery and analysis by Christian Moch.
*   The issue was addressed by a patch that checks for a zero offset before attempting to parse an EBR record
*   The assigned CVSSv3 base score is 4.6 (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
* This issue was fixed in `util-linux-2.23.2-33.el7` and related packages.
