      "summary": "CVE-2016-5338: QEMU built with the ESP/NCR53C9x controller emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read/write access issue. The controller uses a 16-byte FIFO buffer for information transfer. The out-of-bounds read/write occurs while reading/writing to this buffer in `esp_reg_read()` and `esp_reg_write()` routines.",
      "affected_component": "ESP/NCR53C9x controller emulation in QEMU",
      "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds read/write access due to improper index validation when accessing the 16-byte FIFO buffer in the ESP/NCR53C9x controller emulation.",
      "attack_vector": "A privileged user inside the guest operating system.",
      "impact": "A privileged user inside the guest could crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.",
      "affected_versions": "QEMU versions prior to 2.7.0-r3.",
