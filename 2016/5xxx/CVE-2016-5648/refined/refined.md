  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2016-5648",
    "Root cause": "The Acer Portal Android application does not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to the mobile application login server.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can present a bogus SSL certificate, which the application will accept silently. This allows the attacker to intercept usernames, passwords, and sensitive information without the user's knowledge.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Acer Portal app and the login server, allowing them to perform a MITM attack."

  "Affected component": {
    "Name": "Acer Portal Android application",
    "Versions": "versions 3.9.3.2006 and below"
