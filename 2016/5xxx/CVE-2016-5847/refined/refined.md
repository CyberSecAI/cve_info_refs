Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Race condition** in the way SAPCAR changes the permissions of extracted files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) Race Condition [CWE-367]**: There's a time gap between when SAPCAR creates a file and when it changes the file's permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security bypass/Privilege Escalation:** A malicious local user can exploit this race condition to change the permissions of arbitrary files belonging to another user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system and be able to access the directory where the user is extracting files using SAPCAR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create hard links.
*   **Access to Extraction Directory:** The attacker needs access to a directory where another user is extracting files with SAPCAR.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to exploit the time window between file creation and permission change.
*   **Hard Link Creation:** The attacker needs to replace the extracted file with a hard link to a file they wish to modify the permissions of.

**Technical Details:**

1.  SAPCAR extracts a file.
2.  After closing the newly created file, SAPCAR changes its permissions according to the permissions set in the archive file.
3.  A local attacker can replace the extracted file with a hard link to a file belonging to another user during the time gap between file creation and permission change.
4.  SAPCAR will then change the permissions of the hard-linked file (which belongs to a different user) to the same as the compressed file.

This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
