Impact: Denial of service, Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2016-5845, CVE-2016-5847

3. Vulnerability Description

SAP [1] distributes software and packages using an archive program called SAPCAR. This program uses a custom archive
file format. Vulnerabilities were found in the extraction of specially crafted archive files, that could lead to local
denial of service conditions or privilege escalation.

Other products and versions might be affected, but they were not tested.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

SAP published the following Security Notes:

2312905
2327384

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Gallo from Core Security Consulting Services. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquin Rodriguez Varela from Core Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

SAP distributes software and packages using an archive program called SAPCAR. This program uses a custom archive file
format. Vulnerabilities were found in the extraction of specially crafted archive files, that could lead to denial of
service conditions or escalation of privileges.

The code that handles the extraction of archive files is prone to privilege escalation and denial of service
vulnerabilities.

7.1. Denial of service via invalid file names

[CVE-2016-5845] Denial of service vulnerability due the SAPCAR program not checking the return value of file operations
when extracting files. This might result in the program crashing when trying to extract files from an specially crafted
archive file that contains invalid file names for the target platform. Of special interest are applications or
solutions that makes use of SAPCAR in an automated way.

The following is a proof of concept to demonstrate the vulnerability:

        $ xxd SAPCAR_crash.SAR
        0000000: 4341 5220 322e 3031 4452 0081 0000 0f00  CAR 2.01DR......

        $ ./SAPCAR -dvf SAPCAR_crash.SAR
        SAPCAR: processing archive SAPCAR_crash.SAR (version 2.01)
        d input-dir/inp#t
        SAPCAR: checksum error in input-dir/inp#t (error 12). No such file or director

        $ ./SAPCAR -xvf SAPCAR_crash.SAR
        SAPCAR: processing archive SAPCAR_crash.SAR (version 2.01)
        x input-dir/inp#t
        Segmentation fault

7.2. Race condition on permission change

[CVE-2016-5847] Race condition vulnerability due to the way the SAPCAR program change the permissions of extracted
files. If a malicious local user has access to a directory where a user is extracting files using SAPCAR, the attacker
might use this vulnerability to change the permissions of arbitrary files belonging to the user.

The SAPCAR program writes the file being extracted and after closing it, the program changes the permissions to the
ones set on the archive file. There's a time gap between the creating of the file and the change of the permissions.
During this time frame, a malicious local user can replace the extracted file with a hard link to a file belonging to
another user, resulting in the SAPCAR program changing the permissions on the hard-linked file to be the same as that
of the compressed file.

The following is a proof of concept to demonstrate the vulnerability:

      $ xxd SAPCAR_race_condition.SAR
      0000000: 4341 5220 322e 3031 5247 b481 0000 2b00  CAR 2.01RG....+.

2016-05-23: Core Security thanked SAP for the tentative date and informed them we would publish our security advisory accordingly upon their confirmation.
2016-06-27: Core Security requested SAP the tentative security notes numbers and links in order to add them to our security advisory.
2016-07-05: SAP informed Core Security they due to some issues found during their testing phase of the patches they were not in a position to ship the patches as part of their July patch day. They said they would be able to ship the patches with August patch day.
2016-07-06: Core Security requested SAP the specific day in August they planed to release the patches.
2016-07-20: Core Security requested again SAP the specific day in August they planed to release the patches.
2016-07-21: SAP informed Core Security they would publish their security notes on the 9th of August.
2016-08-10: Advisory CORE-2016-0006 published.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
