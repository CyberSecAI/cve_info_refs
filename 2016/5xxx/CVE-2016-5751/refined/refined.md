Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` parameter within SAML AuthnRequests processed by the NetIQ Access Manager Identity Server. Specifically, the Identity Server does not sanitize or check the provided URL, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. By manipulating the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` in a SAML request, an attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when the Identity Provider redirects the user to the provided URL after authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to attacker-controlled websites after successful authentication.
*   **Credential Harvesting:** The injected JavaScript can be used to display a fake login form, tricking the user into entering their credentials which are then sent to the attacker.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Injected scripts could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the authenticated user within the context of the SSO session.
*   **Session hijacking:** While the session id is stored properly, the attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access by tricking the user into performing actions or providing sensitive information in the context of the current session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated SAML Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious SAML AuthnRequest containing the injected JavaScript within the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL`.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to initiate an SSO flow that processes the manipulated SAML request. This can happen by tricking the user into visiting a site that redirects to the Identity Server with a malicious SAML request, or via a malicious iframe on a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft SAML Requests:** The attacker must have the ability to create or modify SAML AuthnRequests.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a way to get the user to initiate the SSO process. This can happen through social engineering, or by hosting malicious content.
*   **Disabling Signature Validation:** The attack is more easily performed if signature validation is disabled on the Identity Provider (IDP), although, this is not explicitly required by the described vulnerability, it is mentioned as a condition under which the attack becomes easier.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates that the session ID itself is not directly exposed or stolen. However, the XSS vulnerability enables the attacker to perform actions within the context of an authenticated session, which can lead to similar outcomes as direct session hijacking.
*   The resolution includes patching to version 4.2.2 for NAM 4.2 and 4.1.2 HF1 for NAM 4.1. As a workaround, enabling signature validation on incoming AuthnRequests is suggested.
*   The vulnerability specifically highlights a lack of validation on the `AssertionConsumerService` URL.
