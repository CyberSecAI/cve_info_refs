{
  "CVE-2016-5019": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is related to the deserialization of the view state in MyFaces Trinidad. The CoreResponseStateManager reads and writes view state strings using ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream directly. By doing so, Trinidad bypasses the view state security features provided by the JSF implementations - ie. the view state is not encrypted and is not MAC’ed.  This allows attackers to perform deserialization attacks.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Trinidad’s CoreResponseStateManager directly uses ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream to read and write view state strings, bypassing JSF's built-in view state security mechanisms.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Missing encryption and MAC for view state"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation allows attackers to perform deserialization attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted view state string to a server using an affected version of Trinidad.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious serialized view state to the server.",
     "Affected product": "Oracle Utilities Framework",
     "Affected component": "Help (Apache Trinidad)",
     "Affected protocol": "HTTP",
     "Remotely exploitable without authentication": "Yes"
