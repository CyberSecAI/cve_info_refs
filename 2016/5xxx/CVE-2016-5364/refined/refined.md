Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `return` URL parameter in the custom fields management pages of MantisBT. Specifically:

1.  **Unescaped Output in Hidden Input Field:** The `return` URL, obtained from the `$_GET` parameter, was not properly escaped before being placed within a hidden input field in `manage_custom_field_edit_page.php`. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML attributes, such as `accesskey`, which could be triggered by a keyboard shortcut to execute XSS code.
2.  **Unsanitized URL in "Proceed" Link:** The `print_bracket_link()` function did not validate the URL before generating the "Proceed" link. This allowed an attacker to inject `javascript:` URI schemes, which would then be executed when a user clicked the generated link on `manage_custom_field_update.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `strip_tags()` function was used to sanitize the input, which failed to strip incomplete HTML tags like `" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)`, enabling the XSS.
*   **Lack of URL Validation:** The `print_bracket_link()` function did not validate URLs before creating links, allowing `javascript:` URLs to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

*   **Execute arbitrary JavaScript:** Attackers could run malicious JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, leading to various malicious activities.
*   **Compromise administrator accounts:** Since the vulnerability is present in custom fields management, it is likely to target administrators.
*   **Steal user session cookies:** An attacker could steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Deface the web application:** Through JavaScript execution, the attacker could modify the content of the page, leading to defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The attacker would manipulate the `return` parameter in the URL, injecting malicious code. For example,
    *   `http://mantis/manage_custom_field_edit_page.php?field_id=1&return=" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)` to inject an accesskey that triggers javascript.
    *   `http://mantis/manage_custom_field_edit_page.php?field_id=1&return=javascript:alert(%27XSS%27);` to inject javascript that executes when the "Proceed" link is clicked.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires some form of user interaction, such as:
    *   The administrator pressing a keyboard shortcut to trigger the accesskey.
    *   The administrator clicking the "Proceed" link after updating a custom field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of MantisBT:** The attacker needs to know how MantisBT handles the `return` parameter.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs that include the malicious code in the `return` parameter.
*   **Target User with Admin Privileges:** The primary target is an administrator of the MantisBT instance, to access the custom fields management pages and trigger the XSS.

**Mitigation:**

The fix includes:

*   **Properly escaping the return URL:** The `string_attribute()` function is used to escape the return URL before inserting it into the hidden form field, preventing HTML injection.
*   **Sanitizing the URL:**  The `string_sanitize_url()` is used to sanitize the URL before displaying it in the "Proceed" link, replacing javascript and data URI schemes with index.php.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes two commits fixing this issue:
    *   `5068df2d` which was a backport fix to the 1.2.x branch.
    *   `11ab3d6c` which fixed the master (1.3.x) branch.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Kacper Szurek.

In summary, CVE-2016-5364 is a reflected XSS vulnerability in MantisBT arising from the improper handling of the `return` URL parameter in custom field management pages. This could be exploited by an attacker by injecting malicious code into the URL and tricking an administrator into triggering it. The fix involves properly escaping the URL in the hidden field and sanitizing it before display in links.
