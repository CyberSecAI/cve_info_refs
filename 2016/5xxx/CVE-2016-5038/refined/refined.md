{
  "cveId": "CVE-2016-5038",
  "rootCause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `dwarf_get_macro_startend_file` function within dwarf_macro5.c. The issue arises when a string offset into the .debug_str section is outside of the section bounds, leading to an invalid memory access.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "impact": "The vulnerability can result in a crash due to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "Crafted ELF file with a string offset outside the .debug_str section bounds."
  ],
  "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted ELF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read during the parsing of macro information.",
   "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability resides specifically in line 772 of `dwarf_macro5.c` where `*src_file_name = macro_context->mc_srcfiles[trueindex];` attempts to access a file name using an index that is out of bounds."
