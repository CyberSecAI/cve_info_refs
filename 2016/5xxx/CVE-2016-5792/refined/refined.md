Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5792

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input fields in Moxa SoftCMS. Specifically, the `getcaminfo.asp` script fails to properly validate a user-supplied string within the VWID element before using it to construct SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The software is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the database access process (Administrator).
*   **Full System Compromise:** Given the high level of access that could be obtained, it could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring authentication.
*   **Network Access:** The attack occurs over the network, likely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable `getcaminfo.asp` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Skill:** The vulnerability is considered easily exploitable by an attacker with low skill.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the Moxa SoftCMS server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Moxa SoftCMS versions prior to 1.5.
*   Moxa has released an update (SoftCMS v1.5) to address the vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a specific filter (ID '25002').
*   The vulnerability was reported to Moxa on June 23, 2016, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was done on August 10, 2016.
*  The CVSS v3 base score was calculated to be 9.8 with vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*  The CVSS v2 score is 9.3 with vector string (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
