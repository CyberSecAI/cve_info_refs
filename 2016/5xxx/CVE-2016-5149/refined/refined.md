    "CVE-2016-5149": {
        "description": "The extensions subsystem in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux relies on an IFRAME source URL to identify an associated extension, which allows remote attackers to conduct extension-bindings injection attacks by leveraging script access to a resource that initially has the about:blank URL.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the extensions subsystem in Google Chrome relying on the IFRAME source URL to identify associated extensions. When an IFRAME initially has an 'about:blank' URL, it can be scripted by its parent, leading to a security vulnerability where an attacker can inject scripts through this mechanism.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Improper validation of IFRAME source URLs",
            "Lack of security checks when determining the associated extension",
            "Script access to about:blank URLs"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote attackers can conduct extension-bindings injection attacks, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code or modify extension behavior.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "A malicious webpage injects a crafted IFRAME that initially has an 'about:blank' URL.",
           "The malicious webpage uses script access to manipulate the IFRAME and perform the injection attack."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to host a malicious webpage and have a user load it via the vulnerable version of Chrome."
