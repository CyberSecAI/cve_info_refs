  "CVE-2016-5007": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Spring Security / MVC Path Matching Inconsistency",
    "details": "Differences in the strictness of URL pattern matching between Spring Security and Spring MVC can lead to certain paths not being recognized as protected by Spring Security, while still being mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. This inconsistency can be compounded by customization of the pattern matching mechanisms in both Spring Security and Spring Framework.\n\nThe root cause lies in the varying strictness of path matching, particularly with regards to space trimming in path segments, and the fact that Spring Framework provides richer pattern matching features. Additionally, the ability to customize pattern matching further exacerbates the inconsistencies.\n\nThe vulnerability is present in Spring Security 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.0 and Spring Framework 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x, as well as other unsupported versions.\n\nAttack vectors involve crafted URLs with inconsistent path segments that bypass Spring Security authorization but are still handled by Spring MVC controllers. Attackers do not require any specific capabilities besides being able to craft these URLs.\n\nThe impact of a successful exploit is that unauthorized users can access protected resources due to the path matching inconsistency, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized actions within the application.",
