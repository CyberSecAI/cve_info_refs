Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-5873:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the URL parsing functions of the PECL HTTP extension for PHP. Specifically, the `parse_*()` functions within `php_http_url.c`, called by `php_http_url_parse()`, are affected.
*   The issue occurs when non-printable characters within a URL are converted to percent-encoding. The `state->offset` used in these functions is incremented without proper checks on the size of the allocated `state->buffer`.
*   When a scheme parsing soft-fails and continues to parse a path, the parser's offset is not reset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The core issue is a buffer overflow due to insufficient checks when converting non-printable URL characters to percent-encoding within the `parse_mb` function. The `state->offset` is incremented without validating the remaining buffer space.
*  **Incorrect offset handling**: The parser's offset is not reset when there is a soft-fail during scheme parsing, leading to potential buffer overflows while parsing the path.
* **Adjacent Memory Corruption**: The buffer `state->buffer` is allocated adjacent to a `php_stream_ops` structure. Overwriting the buffer can corrupt function pointers within this adjacent structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite a function pointer within the `php_stream_ops` structure. When this function pointer is later called, the attacker can redirect program execution to arbitrary code, thus achieving remote code execution.
*   **Segmentation Fault/Crash:** If the overwritten function pointer points to invalid memory addresses, it can lead to a segmentation fault and crash the process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted HTTP request containing a URL with non-printable characters.
*   The malicious input is provided within the URL string.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the PECL HTTP extension for PHP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to a server running a vulnerable version of PHP with the PECL HTTP extension.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication
*   The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the target server.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The `parse_mb()` function in `php_http_url.c` is highlighted as the source of the issue, particularly the incrementing `state->offset` without proper bounds checking.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how a specific HTTP request can trigger the overflow, overwrite the callback function pointer, and cause a segmentation fault.
* The fix included resetting the `state->offset` when scheme parsing softfails and adjusting the calculation of `maxlen`.

**Summary of Fix:**

The fix, described in commit `3724cd76a28be1d6049b5537232e97ac567ae1f5`, addresses the issue by:

*   Resetting the `state->offset` in the `softfail` label of the `parse_scheme` function.
*   Increasing the allocated size of `maxlen` in `php_http_url_parse()` to accommodate the null bytes of components.
