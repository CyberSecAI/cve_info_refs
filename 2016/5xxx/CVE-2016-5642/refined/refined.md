{
  "CVE-2016-5642": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient filtering of SNMP trap supplied data and SNMP agent supplied data before storing and displaying in the Opmantek NMIS application.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SNMP trap messages",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SNMP agent responses",
      "Reflected XSS vulnerability via SNMP agent responses"
     ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated adversary can inject malicious content into the user's browser session, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the authenticated user's browser session and other attacks. The code has access to the authenticated user's cookies and can perform privileged operations.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious SNMP trap messages",
       "Malicious SNMP agent responses",
       "Malicious SNMP Tool walk operation"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker can send malicious SNMP trap messages (if not restricted by snmptrapd configuration) or configure an SNMP agent to provide malicious data during node discovery, update or when using the SNMP Tool walk operation."
