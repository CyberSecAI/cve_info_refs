| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1339988#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-26 10:04:41 UTC  ``` It was found that libimobiledevice and libusbmuxd libraries accidentally bound a listening IPv4 TCP socket to INADDR_ANY instead of INADDR_LOOPBACK.  This socket is used to communicate with services on an iOS device.  The impact is accidental exposure of the iOS device to attackers on the local network.  The RHEL workstation itself is not exposed, nor is there an easy escalation for attackers to gain access to the host.  Upstream patches:  libusbmuxd: <https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libusbmuxd/commit/4397b3376dc4e4cb1c991d0aed61ce6482614196>  libimobiledevice: <https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice/commit/df1f5c4d70d0c19ad40072f5246ca457e7f9849e>  CVE request:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/410>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1339988#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-26 10:05:10 UTC  ```  Created libimobiledevice tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1339990](show_bug.cgi?id=1339990 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5104 libimobiledevice: Sockets listening on INADDR_ANY [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1339988#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-26 10:05:16 UTC  ```  Created libusbmuxd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1339991](show_bug.cgi?id=1339991 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5104 libusbmuxd: libimobiledevice: Sockets listening on INADDR_ANY [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1339988#c3)  Andrej Nemec    2016-05-27 06:51:39 UTC  ``` CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/415>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1339988#c4)  Fedora Update System    2016-05-28 18:33:23 UTC  ``` libimobiledevice-1.2.0-7.fc24, libusbmuxd-1.0.10-5.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.

[@setharnold](https://github.com/setharnold) as you can see from the commit, Joshua Hill aka posixninja is to be credited for the reporting of this vulnerability in both libraries. He reported this to me personally.

Just for reference, please mind that this functionality is indeed wanted for a use-case of connecting externally and was not added "by accident". However, it makes sense to default to local only for now. We'll add a switch or config option for the "external" case to cover that.

Package        : libimobiledevice
Version        : 1.1.6+dfsg-3.1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-5104
Debian Bug     : 825553

It was discovered that libimobiledevice incorrectly handled socket
permissions. A remote attacker could use this issue to access
services on iOS devices, contrary to expectations.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.1.6+dfsg-3.1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libimobiledevice packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Use CVE-2016-5104 for this vulnerability in both products. We did not
investigate how these products were developed, but it is clear that
these were not independent mistakes in separately written code.

Subject: CVE Requests: libimobiledevice and libusbmuxd

Hello MITRE, all,

Please assign CVE(s) to libimobiledevice and libusbmuxd; both libraries
accidentally bound a listening IPv4 TCP socket to INADDR_ANY rather than
INADDR_LOOPBACK:

<https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice/commit/df1f5c4d70d0c19ad40072f5246ca457e7f9849e>
<https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libusbmuxd/commit/4397b3376dc4e4cb1c991d0aed61ce6482614196>

I do not know who to credit with discovery.

Thanks

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : libusbmuxd
Version        : 1.0.9-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-5104
Debian Bug     : 825554

It was discovered that libusbmuxd incorrectly handled socket

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.
