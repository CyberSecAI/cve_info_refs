{
  "cveId": "CVE-2016-5104",
  "description": "The socket_create function in common/socket.c in libimobiledevice and libusbmuxd allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and communicate with services on iOS devices by connecting to an IPv4 TCP socket.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `socket_create` function in `libimobiledevice` and `libusbmuxd` incorrectly binds a listening IPv4 TCP socket to `INADDR_ANY` instead of `INADDR_LOOPBACK`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of socket permissions",
      "Binding to `INADDR_ANY` instead of `INADDR_LOOPBACK`"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker on the local network can bypass access restrictions and communicate with services on iOS devices, contrary to expectations.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network access to the vulnerable service on a host with `libimobiledevice` or `libusbmuxd` installed"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker on the same local network as the vulnerable host."
