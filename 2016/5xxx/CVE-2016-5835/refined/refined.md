Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is related to insufficient access control when viewing revision diffs within WordPress. Specifically, the issue is that the capability check for viewing revision diffs was not properly implemented, allowing users without the necessary permissions to access this information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. Users who did not have the 'edit\_post' capability for a particular post could still potentially view the revision history diffs. This included the actual changes made to the post content over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Revision History:** Attackers, or users with lower privileges than 'edit\_post', could gain unauthorized access to a post's revision history and view the content changes. This can potentially expose sensitive information contained within the post's history.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct access to the revision diff view:** This would be through the WordPress admin interface, by directly trying to access the revision diff view.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress site.
- **Lower Privilege:** The attacker's account must have lower privileges than 'edit\_post' for the specific post in order to exploit the vulnerability. They would need at least 'read_post' access to the content.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by changing the capability check in two locations:
  - `wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php`: The `wp_ajax_get_revision_diffs()` function was changed from checking for `'read_post'` to `'edit_post'` capability.
  - `wp-admin/revision.php`: The revision diff display was changed from checking for `'read_post'` to `'edit_post'` capability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix was included in WordPress version 4.5.3.
- The vulnerability was reported by John Blackbourn from the WordPress security team and by Dan Moen independently.
- This fix is part of a larger security release that addresses multiple vulnerabilities.
