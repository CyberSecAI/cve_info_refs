Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5250:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Resource Timing API in Mozilla Firefox, which incorrectly stores information about resources loaded after a navigation event, specifically during `unload` events, from the previous page into the next page's resource timing data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The primary weakness is a data leakage issue. The Resource Timing API is intended to provide performance timing data of resources loaded by the current page. However, due to an implementation flaw, data from the previous page is carried over to the new page, violating the intended isolation of browsing contexts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

A malicious website can potentially obtain sensitive information about resources loaded by a previous website that a user visited. This information could reveal details about the user's browsing history, internal resources accessed by the prior page, or potentially, other sensitive data embedded in URLs. This vulnerability is categorized as an information disclosure issue.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is network-based and requires a user to navigate from a malicious web page to another page. Specifically, the malicious page needs to initiate a network request during its unload event.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker must have the ability to host a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need special privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered when a user navigates away from the malicious page and loads another webpage, either controlled by the attacker or a different site. The malicious page has to initiate a request within its unload handler.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Firefox before version 48.0, Firefox ESR before 45.4, and Thunderbird before 45.4
*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the resource timing data for one page is not carried over to the next page when a navigation occurs.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Catalin Dumitru.
