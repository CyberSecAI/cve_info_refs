Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5409:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure to set the `HttpOnly` flag on the `GEARID` cookie when it is created by OpenShift Enterprise 2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of the `HttpOnly` attribute on the `GEARID` cookie.
- This makes the cookie accessible to client-side scripts (e.g. JavaScript)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If an attacker can inject or execute malicious client-side scripts (e.g., through a Cross-Site Scripting - XSS vulnerability) they could access the `GEARID` cookie
- The attacker could potentially use this cookie to hijack a user's session, impersonate the user, or perform other malicious actions depending on the application's implementation and the cookie's purpose.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through client-side script injection or execution, commonly via XSS vulnerabilities
- An attacker needs to be able to execute malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser. This could be achieved through various methods such as reflected XSS, stored XSS, etc.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject or execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, within the context of the vulnerable OpenShift Enterprise 2 application.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, since XSS attacks can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug report indicates that the issue is rated as having a "Low" security impact.
- Red Hat has stated that this issue is not planned to be addressed in future updates ("CLOSED WONTFIX").
- The `GEARID` cookie is specifically mentioned in the context of this vulnerability.
