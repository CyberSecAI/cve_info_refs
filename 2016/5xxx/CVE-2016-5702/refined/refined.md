Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how phpMyAdmin handles the `PHP_SELF` variable and potentially the `REQUEST_URI`. If `PHP_SELF` is not properly set by the server, the application falls back to `REQUEST_URI`. This variable could contain user-controlled data, specifically `PATH_INFO`. The vulnerability arises when an attacker manipulates the `PATH_INFO` part of the `REQUEST_URI`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cookie Attribute Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary values into browser cookies by manipulating the `PATH_INFO` portion of the `REQUEST_URI` when `PHP_SELF` is not set correctly. This is because the application uses the potentially tainted `REQUEST_URI` to build the cookie path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is the ability to inject arbitrary values into browser cookies. While the provided information marks this as "non-critical," manipulating cookies can be used in various attacks, potentially leading to session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other malicious actions depending on the application's use of cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the `REQUEST_URI`, specifically the `PATH_INFO` component, which can be controlled by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the phpMyAdmin application where `PHP_SELF` is not set, and manipulate the `PATH_INFO` part of the `REQUEST_URI` to include the malicious cookie attributes.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is addressed in phpMyAdmin 4.6.3 and later by correctly sanitizing or ignoring the path info in the `REQUEST_URI`. The commit [27caf5b46bd0890e576fea7bd7b166a0639fdf68](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/27caf5b46bd0890e576fea7bd7b166a0639fdf68) on GitHub includes code to improve the detection of the script name, specifically to remove the `PATH_INFO` from `REQUEST_URI`.
* The vulnerability is identified as CWE-661 (Improper Handling of URL Encoding).
* The fix ensures that the application strips the `PATH_INFO` from the `REQUEST_URI` to get the accurate path of the script, which is used for setting up cookies.
*   The provided test code shows how the path info is removed.
