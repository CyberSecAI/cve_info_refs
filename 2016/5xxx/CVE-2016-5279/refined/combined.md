If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1226977](/show_bug.cgi?id=1226977 "RESOLVED FIXED - Outgoing dataTransfer items are not filtered") +++
1. Visit <<https://ebenda.org/2016/file-path/display.html>>.
2. Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer or (GNOME/Ubuntu) Files (Nautilus) into the web page.
3. You will see the full path of the dragged path.
The full path will be available via dataTransfer.getData("text/x-moz-url") on Windows and GNU/Linux (and probably OS X).
It will also be available via various other types when dragged from Nautilus.
The "text/x-moz-url" content is completely synthesized by Firefox, whereas Nautilus really sends ['x-special/gnome-icon-list', 'text/uri-list', 'UTF8\_STRING', 'COMPOUND\_TEXT', 'TEXT', 'STRING', 'text/plain;charset=utf-8', 'text/plain']) containing the file URL. Firefox will have, for better or worse, to disregard these types in this case as to conform to the platform's convetion (Chrome seems to disregard all other types if Files are provided during drag and drop).
It is questionable whether this path should be available to web content for privacy reasons. It also allows for further exploitation ("Disclosure of OS username" is the most easy) and can help to exploit other bugs (as shown in [bug 1226977 comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1226977#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Outgoing dataTransfer items are not filtered")). For the input element, it was considered a security bug (<<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2013-43/>>).
Existing web content might depend on this (a possible use case would be an internal CMS storing paths of images dragged and dropped from a shared network drive to track and automatically update them on changes). Chrome does not expose the full path of dropped files to web pages in either case (unsure about other browsers implementing dragging and dropping of files), so this is not really web-compatible anyhow, and I guess Firefox should not expose the paths either.

We long ago stopped revealing the full file path as part of the file upload control. This is analogous and we should do the same kind of stripping.Group: core-security → dom-core-securityStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [csectype-disclosure](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-disclosure&resolution=---),

So there are two options here:
1. When a file is being dropped, don't expose the non-file data.
2. When a file is being dropped, throw an error when unprivileged code tries to get non-file data.
I suspect some chrome code may rely on the non-file data, so the latter would be less likely to cause regressions.

I forget what the web-exposed APIs look like for drag'n'drop. But we should definitely expose both the file and the filename (but not the whole path) to the webpage.
If there's chrome code which relies using the same APIs as the ones we expose to the web, but that still need the full path+filename, then we can put logic in the C++ code which checks if the caller is chrome or a webpage and adjust the returned value based on that.

The filename is already exposed via dataTransfer.files[x].name
The issue here is the OS is providing a text or url alternative to the file that includes the full path. The proposal here is to either remove these or throw an error when trying to retrieve them. The files portion would be unaffected.

Ah! Thanks!
Removing them is likely safer from a webcompat point of view. There's always risk that a page tries to get multiple different formats and end up breaking if one of them throw an exception. Especially if there's API for enumerating different formats.
But I don't know for sure if throwing will be a problem, so I don't feel strongly either way.

Attached patch

[Remove non-file types](attachment.cgi?id=8736425&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8736425&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1249522&attachment=8736425)

This patch removes the non-file types when types or getData (or the moz variants) are called from a non-privileged context. Chrome callers are left alone.
A test is added which tests this for clipboard use.

I changed all type getting code to share the same path. This patch fixes a test that failed from the previous patch.

Remove non-file types
+ yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

+ searchbar.removeEventListener("copy", copyEvent, true);
You're adding listener for paste, but removing listener for copy?

So you're checking addFile already above, so no need to do it again.
And I would use !LegacyIsCallerChromeOrNativeCode() here.
It changes the behavior a bit though, since native caller wouldn't be handled as content JS, like your code does here.
+ // If this is a content caller, and a file is in the data transfer, only
+ // return the file type.
+ if (!format.EqualsLiteral(kFileMime) &&
+ !nsContentUtils::IsSystemPrincipal(aSubjectPrincipal)) {
+ uint32\_t count = item.Length();
+ for (uint32\_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
+ if (item[i].mFormat.EqualsLiteral(kFileMime)) {
+ return NS\_OK;
+ }
+ }
+ }
So what should happen if content tries to access "Files" and not application/x-moz-file?

Nothing special. The "Files" special name only applies to .types

[crash.html (testcase, crashes firefox)](attachment.cgi?id=8780507)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8780507&action=edit)

A integer overflow vulnerability exists in nsBMPEncoder::AddImageFrame:
BMPEncoder.cpp:
191: auto row = MakeUniqueFallible<uint8\_t[]>(mBMPInfoHeader.width \*
192: BytesPerPixel(mBMPInfoHeader.bpp));
The testcase crashes the latest 64-bit ASAN build of Firefox as follows:
crash.html:
<script>
c=document.createElement('canvas');
c.setAttribute('width',(0x100000000/4) + 4);
c.toBlob(alert, "image/bmp", "-moz-parse-options:format=bmp;bpp=32");
</script>
ASAN output:

At one point our image frames were capped at 32K pixels a side to prevent integer overflows. Did that get relaxed? Shouldn't canvas have the same limits?Flags: needinfo?(milan)

The cause for the problem seems clear (not all the image decode paths aren't checking for large memory allocation requests), but it isn't clear why mozregression is pushing me here, as for when the problem started: <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=a6a457fe2a2a&tochange=80431d4fd0da>Assignee: nobody → milan

There are other places where we should be checking, but that would make it a larger patch. This plugs this particular issue, and I have a larger patch that would deal with related possible problems. There will also be a crash test, though I imagine we would land that separately?
Oh, and this does fix the crash in [bug 1294622](/show_bug.cgi?id=1294622 "RESOLVED FIXED") as well - the problem isn't image format specific.Flags: needinfo?(milan)

Minimal patch (if we need to uplift) to check for integer overflow
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
You could tell a large "something" is involved, but they would need to work to figure out that it's the canvas and toBlob method.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Points in the vague direction.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should apply cleanly, and if it doesn't with a trivial rebase.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very low risk, not likely to cause a regression.
This patch should be appropriate for aurora/beta/release/esr45 if we think it's critical enough.

Due to [flaws in the process we used to update "Preloaded Public Key Pinning"](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/09/16/update-on-add-on-pinning-vulnerability/) in our releases, the pinning for add-on updates became ineffective in early September. An attacker who was able to get a mis-issued certificate for a Mozilla web site could send malicious add-on updates to users on networks controlled by the attacker. Users who have not installed any add-ons are not affected.
