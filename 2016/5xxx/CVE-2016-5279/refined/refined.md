Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5279:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly mentions "CVE-2016-5279: Full local path of files is available to web pages after drag and drop" and links it to bug 1249522. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- When files are dragged and dropped into a web page, the browser exposes the full local path of the file to the web page's scripts via `dataTransfer.getData("text/x-moz-url")` on Windows and Linux.
- This information is synthesized by Firefox and is not part of the standard drag-and-drop behavior on these platforms.
- Nautilus on Linux sends multiple types during drag and drop. Firefox synthesizes the 'text/x-moz-url' type, exposing the local file path when it shouldn't.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive information â€“ the full local file path.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** Firefox's behavior of providing the full path is inconsistent with other browsers (like Chrome) that don't expose this information.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privacy Risk:** The most immediate impact is the exposure of the user's local file system structure and potentially the username, which can be a privacy concern.
- **Secondary Exploitation:** This vulnerability could be combined with other vulnerabilities to create more significant exploits. For example, as mentioned in the bug report, it could help exploit other bugs.
- **Potential for Abuse:** Malicious websites could leverage the path information to try to probe the user's filesystem or gain other unauthorized access.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Drag-and-Drop Interaction:** The attack vector is that users are tricked into dragging and dropping files onto a malicious webpage.
- **Web Page Script:** The malicious JavaScript on a webpage uses the dataTransfer API to obtain the local file path.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Web Server:** An attacker needs a web server hosting the malicious web page.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to social engineer or entice the victim to drag-and-drop files into a web page.
- **Basic Web Development Skills:** Knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript is required to create the malicious web page.

**Additional Details from the Bug Report:**

- The vulnerability affects Windows and Linux systems, but not macOS.
- The fix involves removing the non-file types when `types` or `getData` is called from non-privileged contexts to not expose the full path.
- Chrome code that may rely on non-file data is left unaffected.
- The fix was initially backed out due to an issue on Android.
- The bug was marked as a security issue and received a bounty.
- The fix was included in Firefox 49 and subsequent releases.

This information is more detailed than the initial CVE description, offering a clearer understanding of the vulnerability and its resolution.
