Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the Business Process Editor within Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and BRMS displays business process details. The editor fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying business process details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This occurs because the Business Process Editor does not properly sanitize the business process details before rendering them to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the business process details.
- When other users, including administrators, view the compromised business process, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browser within the context of the vulnerable application.
- This can lead to various malicious actions such as:
  - Stealing session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Modifying displayed content or application behavior.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be launched remotely.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with the privilege to create or modify business processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account.
- The attacker must possess the required permissions to create and/or modify business process details within the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite or BRMS.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
- The Business Process Editor fails to sanitize business process details.
- An authenticated attacker can inject malicious script.
- When other users view the crafted details, the script is executed leading to XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jeremy Choi (Red Hat Product Security).
- The issue was resolved in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.3.3 and Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.3.3.
- The fix was released in RHSA-2016:1969 and RHSA-2016:1968 respectively.
