- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization, specifically a failure to properly validate user-provided input before embedding it into the web interface. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to neutralize or sanitize user-supplied input which allows an attacker to embed malicious client-side scripts into the web page viewed by other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the application.
    - Disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
    - Potential compromise of user data or unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript payloads and injects them via input parameters to the application. When a user views the web page containing the unsanitized malicious scripts, the code is executed in the context of the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to supply crafted input parameters to the vulnerable application (low privilege). The vulnerability is triggered when another user loads a page with the crafted scripts.

**Additional details:**
- The provided text offers mitigation strategies, detailing the need to modify the security filter XML file, specifically focusing on `RegExpSecurityFilter` for data type validation and `ScriptSecurityFilter` for blocking invalid script values.
- The fix involves updating `FileNet Workplace XT` to version 1.1.5.2-WPXT-LA011 or higher and `FileNet Workplace` to version 4.0.2.14-P8AE-IF001 or higher.
