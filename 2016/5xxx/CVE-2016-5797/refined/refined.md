- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application exposes sensitive information through error messages, which facilitates brute-force authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure through error messages (CWE-209).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could leverage the exposed information in error messages to conduct a brute-force attack against user credentials. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).
