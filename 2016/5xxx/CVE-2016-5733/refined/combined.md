                 CVE-2016-5739

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in phpMyAdmin, the web-based
MySQL administration interface.

CVE-2016-1927

    The suggestPassword function relied on a non-secure random number
    generator which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess
    generated passwords via a brute-force approach.

CVE-2016-2039

    CSRF token values were generated by a non-secure random number
    genrator, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
    restrictions by predicting a value.

CVE-2016-2040

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2041

    phpMyAdmin does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing
    CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
    intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.

CVE-2016-2560

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2561

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5099

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5701

    For installations running on plain HTTP, phpMyAdmin allows remote
    attackers to conduct BBCode injection attacks against HTTP sessions
    via a crafted URI.

CVE-2016-5705

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5706

    phpMyAdmin allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (resource consumption) via a large array in the scripts parameter.

CVE-2016-5731

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5733

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5739

    A specially crafted Transformation could leak information which
    a remote attacker could use to perform cross site request forgeries.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.2.12-2+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.6.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.

# CVE-2016-5739

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5735.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5746.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5739 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5739)

#### Description

The Transformation implementation in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 does not use the no-referrer Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks by reading an authentication token in a Referer header, related to libraries/Header.php.

### Summary

Multiple XSS vulnerabilities

### Description

* A vulnerability was reported allowing a specially crafted table name to cause an XSS attack through the functionality to check database privileges.
  + This XSS doesn't exist in some translations due to different quotes being used there (eg. Czech).
* A vulnerability was reported allowing a specifically-configured MySQL server to execute an XSS attack. This particular attack requires configuring the MySQL server log\_bin directive with the payload.
* Several XSS vulnerabilities were found with the Transformation feature
* Several XSS vulnerabilities were found in AJAX error handling
* Several XSS vulnerabilities were found in the Designer feature
* An XSS vulnerability was found in the charts feature
* An XSS vulnerability was found in the zoom search feature

### Severity

We consider these attacks to be of moderate severity.

### Affected Versions

All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.3), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.7), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.16) are affected

### Solution

## PMASA-2016-24

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2016-24

**Date:** 2016-06-23

### Summary

XSS through FPD

### Description

With a specially crafted request, it is possible to trigger an XSS attack through the example OpenID authentication script.

### Severity

We do not consider this vulnerability to be secure due to the non-standard required PHP setting for html\_errors.

### Mitigation factor

The attack requires html\_errors = Off in php.ini, so it can be mitigated by setting html\_errors = On.
As an alternative mitigation means, the ./examples/openid.php file can be removed.

### Affected Versions

All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.3), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.7), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.16) are affected

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.6.3, 4.4.15.7, or 4.0.10.16 or newer or apply patch listed below.

### References

Thanks to Emanuel Bronshtein [@e3amn2l](https://twitter.com/e3amn2l) for reporting this vulnerability.
