Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-5733:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2016-5733 lies in the insufficient sanitization and encoding of user-controlled input within various parts of phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the failure to properly escape or validate data before rendering it in HTML contexts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which appears in multiple areas of the application:
    *   **Table Name Mishandling (table\_row.phtml):** A crafted table name can inject malicious scripts when being processed during privilege checks.
    *   **mysqld Log\_bin Directive (log\_selector.phtml):** A malicious `log_bin` directive in the MySQL server configuration could be used to inject scripts.
    *   **Transformation Implementation:** The transformation feature, which modifies data presentation, was vulnerable to script injection.
    *   **AJAX Error Handling (js/ajax.js):** Error messages displayed via AJAX were not properly escaped, allowing script injection.
    *   **Designer Feature:** The Designer component, used for database diagramming, had XSS issues.
    *   **Charts Feature (js/tbl\_chart.js):** The chart generation functionality was susceptible to XSS.
    *  **Zoom Search (rows\_zoom.phtml):** The zoom search feature did not properly escape search column types, making it vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities would allow an attacker to:
*   Inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into the phpMyAdmin interface, which could be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   Potentially steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   Deface web pages displayed through phpMyAdmin.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Perform other malicious actions such as keylogging or phishing.
*   Perform Cross Site Request Forgery attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors depend on the specific vulnerability instance:
*   **Network:** The vulnerabilities are network-based and exploitable by an attacker who can interact with the phpMyAdmin web interface.
*   **Crafted Input:** The primary attack vector involves injecting specially crafted input into the system. This may include crafted table names, MySQL directives, malformed input in a transformation feature and other malicious parameters through a user interaction.
*   **Specific Configurations:** For the log\_bin vulnerability, a malicious `log_bin` directive needs to be configured in the MySQL server settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the phpMyAdmin application.
*   **Understanding of phpMyAdmin:** The attacker needs to know how to utilize the vulnerability within the system.
*   **For Log\_bin XSS :** Requires access to the MySQL server to configure the `log_bin` directive, meaning the attacker requires write or administrative access to the database configuration.
*   **User Interaction :** A user interaction would be needed to trigger XSS vulnerabilities that are not automatically triggered.

**Additional Notes**
*   The severity was rated as moderate.
*   The SUSE information indicates that their products were not affected, but they did provide security advisories.
*   The provided information includes fixes and commits related to this CVE. The fixes include escaping HTML and attributes in multiple files in the phpmyadmin project.

In summary, CVE-2016-5733 encompasses multiple XSS vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin that stem from a lack of proper output encoding in various parts of the application, thus allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of other users.
