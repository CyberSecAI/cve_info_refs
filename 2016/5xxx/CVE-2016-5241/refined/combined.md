Various security issues were discovered in Graphicsmagick, a collection
of image processing tools. Heap-based buffer overflows or overreads may
lead to a denial of service or disclosure of in-memory information or
other unspecified impact by processing a malformed image file.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.20-3+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

All these bugs are related with the parsing and processing of SVG files. Upstream is notified and working to fix them but in the meantime be carefull if you process untrusted SVG files using GraphicsMagick.  Here is the summary of vulnerabilities we found.

Fix another case of [CVE-2016-2317](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2317) (heap buffer overflow) in the MVG rendering code (also impacts SVG).  - arithmetic exception converting a svg file ([CVE-2016-5241](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5241))  - Arithmetic exception converting a svg file caused by a X%0 operation in magick/render.c ([CVE-2016-2318](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2318))  - A shell exploit ([CVE-2016-5118](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5118)) was discovered associated with a filename syntax where file names starting with '|' are intepreted as shell commands executed via popen(). Insufficient sanitization in the SVG and MVG renderers allows such filenames to be passed through from potentially untrusted files. There might be other ways for untrusted inputs to produce such filenames. Due to this issue, support for the feature is removed entirely.  gnudl, octave, pdf2djvu, and photoqt packages have been rebuilt to use the updated GraphicsMagick++ library.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> We recently tested GraphicsMagick with our tool and found two issues that
> causes DoS:

> * Infinite loop caused by converting a circularly defined svg file.

Use CVE-2016-5240.

>> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/05/01/6>

>> It is worth noting that ImageMagick's built-in SVG renderer has the
>> same problem with "circular.svg" (specify the input file name like
>> "msvg:circular.svg").

We feel that this ImageMagick issue is also within the scope of the
CVE-2016-5240 ID.

> * Arithmetic exception converting a svg file caused by a X%0 operation in
> magick/render.c:3800
>
>     (long) (y-fill_pattern->tile_info.y) % fill_pattern->rows,

Use CVE-2016-5241.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=983309#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2016-06-06 14:59:07 UTC  ``` rh#1333417      We recently tested GraphicsMagick with our tool and found two issues that     causes DoS:       * Infinite loop caused by converting a circularly defined svg file.  Use CVE-2016-5240.          <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/05/01/6>           It is worth noting that ImageMagick's built-in SVG renderer has the          same problem with "circular.svg" (specify the input file name like          "msvg:circular.svg").   We feel that this ImageMagick issue is also within the scope of the CVE-2016-5240 ID.

# [1.3.46 (???? ??, 2025)](#id3)

Special Issues:

* GraphicsMagick needs some additional productive volunteers. For
  several years now, the burden has entirely been on me (Bob
  Friesenhahn). I have been sheparding the project for 23 years
  already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick combined
  for 29 years already). Volunteers are needed to add/improve
  new/existing file format support, and to assure correct operation on
  all targets.

Security Fixes:

* JXL: Apply image dimension resource limits.
* WPG: Assure that the palette buffer is allocated and the current
  size (SourceForge bug #750).

Bug fixes:

* BMP: Assure that the opacity channel is initialized, even if the
  image is indicated to be opaque. This avoids issues with code which
  assumes that the opacity channel is always initialized.
* JPEG: Since GraphicsMagick 1.3.43, CMYK JPEG has been writing
  inverted. This bug is now fixed.
* TclMagick: The TclMagick build uses the latest TEA tcl.m4 macros,
  while modernizing the Automake and Autoconf files. Many defects in
  the C code are corrected. The libttkcommon "shim" library,
  previously used to allow TkMagick to work, is completely
  eliminated. The names of installed shared objects now match the
  names generated by the TEA tcl.m4 module. The TclMagick tests are
  integrated into the build via 'make check' and 'make test'. Even
  'make distcheck' works now.
* Hull transform: Fix a arithemetic overflow regression added on
  October 21, 2023.
* Magick++ 'analyze' demo: Request "Analyze" rather than "analyze". It
  is not clear how this was working before.

New Features:

* Support the newer Artifex urw-base35-fonts. Both OpenType and
  Postscript Type 1 fonts are supported. This is in response to to
  Debian bug 1019717 "Display of an SVG file broken due to gsfonts
  transition",
  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1019717>.
* Support XML predefined entities when reading delegates.mgk so that
  it may be expressed in valid XML.

API Updates:

* Magick++: Added InitializeMagickSentinel helper class, which
  performs the function of InitializeMagick() and invokes
  DestroyMagick() when an object created based on it goes out of
  scope. The Magick++ demos and tests are updated to use this class.

Behavior Changes:

* Magick++: Support for automatic cleanup via a 'MagickCleanUp' static
  object is removed due to race conditions with static destruction in
  other libraries.

Build Changes:

* Update Libtool to version 2.5.4.
* Test and demo programs are added to Coverity analysis. This
  necessitated fixing test/demo code to use "secure" buffer handling.
* Build the software differently for the oss-fuzz build so that
  features not useful, or harmful to, oss-fuzz testing are
  removed. This is indicated when
  FUZZING\_BUILD\_MODE\_UNSAFE\_FOR\_PRODUCTION is defined.
* The oss-fuzz build script (fuzzing/oss-fuzz-build.sh) is
  subtantially updated to build a fully-featured libheif, with a set
  of common libraries it depends on.

# [1.3.45 (August 27, 2024)](#id4)

Special Issues:

* GraphicsMagick needs some additional productive volunteers. For
  several years now, the burden has entirely been on me (Bob
  Friesenhahn). I have been sheparding the project for 22 years
  already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick combined
  for 28 years already). Volunteers are needed to add/improve
  new/existing file format support, and to assure correct operation on
  all targets.

Security Fixes:

* None

Bug fixes:

* Fix off-by-one bug added by the 1.3.44 release to the sub-image
  specification parser, and which resulted in one less page being
  returned than expected (SourceForge bug #746 Off-by-one-error when
  converting PDF with multiple pages).

New Features:

* None

# [1.3.44 (August 18, 2024)](#id5)

Special Issues:

* GraphicsMagick needs some additional productive volunteers. For
  several years now, the burden has entirely been on me (Bob
  Friesenhahn). I have been sheparding the project for 22 years
  already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick combined
  for 28 years already). Volunteers are needed to add/improve
  new/existing file format support, and to assure correct operation on
  all targets.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project since
  February 4 2018 due to the contributions and assistance of Alex
  Gaynor and Paul Kehrer. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. Please consult the
  GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
  the oss-fuzz issues list for details.
* GraphicsMagick has been participating in Synopsys's Coverity program
  for free software projects since 2015. There has been a continuing
  objective to keep outstanding defects at 0, or very close to 0.
  Information about the Coverity status may be found at
  <https://scan.coverity.com/projects/graphicsmagick>.
* TIFF: Fixed multiple heap and stack buffer overflows (directed by
  the source EXIF profile) while writing EXIF into the native TIFF
  IFD.
* FITS: Fix problem that the FITS reader could return invalid image
  frames with rows or columns set to zero. Other code in the library
  crashes, or even asserts, if invalid image frames with rows or
  columns set to zero are returned.
* Coverity fixes: Various fixes for Coverity issues raised after the
  update to version 2023.12.2.
* Clang Analyzer (scan-build) fixes: Various fixes for new issues
  discovered by Clang Analyzer.

Bug fixes:

* configure.ac: Fix a shell syntax error.
* GCC 14: Eliminate some new warnings which appeared while in -Wall
  mode.
* JPEG: FormatJPEGSamplingFactors() now properly handles the number of
  samples for each colorspace.
* JXL: Additional validations of color channel and alpha channel
  depth.
* TGA: Fix issues discovered by Coverity.
* TGA: Fix writing TGA with opacity values in palette.
* TGA: Default orientation is (again) TopLeftOrientation.
* TIFF: Verify that TIFFTAG\_BITSPERSAMPLE is within a rational range.
* TXT: Eliminate use of an uninitialized-value in GetColorTuple().
* XML: Improve detection of if the deprecated HTTP and FTP protocols
  are supported by libxml2.

New Features:

* Add support for reading the pre-rendered image from the Open Raster
  ("ORA") format. Actual rendering of Open Raster is not supported.
* Add support for Dune HD AAI Image (aka Auburn Animation Image) image
  format ("AAI").
* Add support for a --version option, which produces GNU style summary
  version output.
* Identify output now indicates if the image is opaque.
* WebP: Add support for '-define webp:exact=true' to preserve exact
  RGB values under transparent areas while writing WebP format.
  Enable this automatically when lossless is enabled. If lossless is
  enabled, this option may be used to disable exact mode.
* PerlMagick: Add AccessDefinition(), AddDefinition(),
  AddDefinitions(), and RemoveDefinitions() methods to supporting
  adding, updating, removing definitions.

API Updates:

* Magick++/STL.h: The deprecated std::unary\_function is no longer used
  given C++'11 or later. Continued use of it caused too many issues
  due to an abundance of warnings.
* Wand API PixelSetQuantumColor(): The color argument is now a const
  pointer.

Behavior Changes:

* The graphical progress indication in the X11 sub-apps 'animate' and
  'display' is disabled due to discovering a tremendous performance
  impact while rendering text under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. The underlying
  cause of the performance impact is not yet known. A text-based
  progress output to the program's console is available via
  -monitor.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Zip support is obtained from existing zlib contrib/minizip source code.

Build Changes:

* Libzip is now supported in the build in order to support the ORA
  format. Please note that this library often depends on a large
  crypto library such as OpenSSL, although crypto is not required to
  read the ORA format.
* The VisualMagick build is modified to use existing minizip source
  files to support the ORA format.
* fuzzing/oss-fuzz-build.sh: Continued improvements to the oss-fuzz
  build script, which builds almost all 3rd party libraries that
  GraphicsMagick depends on.
* Improve the build for Mingw-w64. Remove mention from the
  documentation regarding the original MinGW (for which the build
  still works) given that the project seems to be defunct and
  unusable.
* FPX: Support building with libfpx ("FlashPIX") again. FlashPIX is
  not recommended for any production work due to libfpx having a
  defective API, bad behavior, and many implementation issues
  (especially memory leaks).

Behavior Changes:

* MagickMaxFileSystemBlockSize: Place an arbitrary limit (4,194,304
  bytes) on maximum filesystem block size.

# [1.3.43 (March 23, 2024)](#id6)

Special Issues:

* Due to my Internet provider (which I have used since 2001) failing
  to support the antiquated technology which hosts GraphicsMagick.org,
  and the simple.dallas.tx.us domain I have used since 1994, these
  services are now failing. To make matters worse, due to dramatic
  changes in US domain registration in recent years, I do not know how
  to update the DNS registrations for simple.dallas.tx.us and my
  historical email address may be lost. As time permits,
  GraphicsMagick.org will be re-hosted in the cloud at Linode.
* GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
  volunteers. For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
  me (Bob Friesenhahn). I have been sheparding the project for 22
  years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
  combined for 28 years already). It is not reasonable to expect
  someone with a full time job (and expecting to retire in a few
  years) to do all of the work.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project since
  February 4 2018 due to the contributions and assistance of Alex
  Gaynor and Paul Kehrer. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term

  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. Please consult the

  the oss-fuzz issues list for details.
* GraphicsMagick has been participating in Synopsys's Coverity program
  for free software projects since 2015. There has been a continuing
  objective to keep outstanding defects at 0, or very close to 0.
  Information about the Coverity status may be found at
  <https://scan.coverity.com/projects/graphicsmagick>.

Bug fixes:

* JBIG: Add support for 'width', 'height', and 'pixels', resource
  limits. Your mileage may vary.
* WPG: Many fixes based on oss-fuzz testing.
* Ghostscript: When invoking Ghostscript, re-direct Ghostscript stdout
  to stderr to avoid output corruption when GM stdout is redirected to
  a file.

New Features:

* File write limit: Add support for a per-file write limit (-limit
  write or MAGICK\_LIMIT\_WRITE). This imposes a limit on the number of
  uncompressed bytes written. The behavior when the limit is hit is
  similar to an unexpected write error, as if the disk is full.
* Resource limit highwater: Resource highwater values are maintained
  for successful resource requests and final values are traced
  via -debug resource' at the end of program execution. These values
  may be used to understand the most restrictive resource limits which
  may be applied while still achieving successful operation.
* BMP: Support BI\_PNG compression (PNG inside BMP).
* BMP: Support reading 64 bits-per-pixel.
* BMP: Support reading 48 bits-per-pixel.
* HEIF: Call heif\_init() and heif\_deinit() if they are
  available. Support setting image width limit.
* HRZ: Added support for Slow scan TV format.
* JPEG: Added support for reading and writing lossy or lossless 12
  bits, and lossless 16-bits using libjpeg-turbo-3.0
* JXL: Improve JXL reader/writer exception information.
* TIFF: Remove miniswhite/minisblack prohibitions when using Group3
  and Group4 compression in order to allow using inverted photometric
  from the standard.
* TIFF: Store EXIF IFD and GPS IFD tag information natively in TIFF
  sub-IFDs, the same as it would be produced in a camera supporting
  TIFF. This allows an EXIF profile from HEIF, JPEG, JXL, PNG, WebP,
  or from the META coder to be preserved in TIFF.

API Updates:

* ExpandFilenames(): Fix memory leak of existing allocations if
  realloc() fails.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* libjpeg: Update bundled IJG JPEG sources to version 9f.
* libtiff: Update bundled libtiff sources to version 4.5.1.

Build Changes:

* Since it seems that OSDN has died, Hepapod is now used to provide a
  redundant https-capable Hg service and may provide services that
  SourceForge does not offer. Hg checkouts may now be made from
  "<https://foss.heptapod.net/graphicsmagick/graphicsmagick>".
* Autotools-based build: pkg-config provided data is now used to the
  maximal extent possible. However, if pkg-config fails to provide
  useful data, then the previously existing tests will still prevail.
  Document that PKG\_CONFIG='pkg-config --static' ./configure should
  reveal the private library dependencies needed for a fully-static
  build to succeed.
* Autotools-based build: Base decision on if OpenMP is supported on
  the '\_OPENMP' pre-processor define.
* Autotools-based build: No longer search for (and use) libtrio by
  default. The user now needs to request using it.
* Autotools-based build: Fixes for autoconf-2.72. Bootstrapped using
  Autoconf 2.69, Automake 1.16.5, and Libtool 2.4.7.
* oss-fuzz build: The fuzzing/oss-fuzz-build.sh is re-written in order
  to support almost all possible dependency libraries. For example,
  JXL and HEIF (with HEIC and AVIF reader support) are now included in
  oss-fuzz testing.

Behavior Changes:

* None

# [1.3.42 (September 23, 2023)](#id7)

Special Issues:

* GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
  volunteers. For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
  me (Bob Friesenhahn). I have been sheparding the project for 22

  Information about the Coverity status may be found at
  <https://scan.coverity.com/projects/graphicsmagick>.

Bug fixes:

* TIFF: Default the alpha channel to type EXTRASAMPLE\_UNASSALPHA(2).
* BMP: Many fixes for reading esoteric BMP sub-formats.
* TranslateTextEx(): Revert change so now a NULL pointer is returned
  when given an empty string. Some algorithms (e.g. montage) were
  depending on this!.
* PAM: Fix reading comments.
* PNG: Added Add missing module aliases "PNG00", "PNG48", "PNG64", so
  it is again possible to request these subformats directly.
* TIFF: For common formats with the required number of channels, but
  one is an 'unspecified' channel, promote unspecified alpha to
  unassociated alpha so that the alpha channel is not ignored.
* "Magick" command line emulation: Eliminate duplicate utility name
  output in error messages

New Features:

* BMP: Added the ability to read and write BMP using JPEG compression.
  Use '-define bmp:allow-jpeg' to allow use of JPEG compression.
* BMP: Added support for BI\_ALPHABITFIELDS compression
* BMP: Added support for reading BMP with PNG compression.

API Updates:

* None.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None.

Build Changes:

* Inno-Setup installer script now also supports MSVC 2010 and 2013
  runtimes.
* Support for the 'XTRN' coder (needed by ImageMagickObject) is now
  optional and disabled by default.
* Visual Studio 2013 (MSVC 12.0) (or later) is needed to build 64-bit
  applications given that 'strtod()' is broken in earlier versions.
  Not much works at all if strtod() does not work properly.

Behavior Changes:

* Decided to *not* deprecate the ability to extend existing image
  attribute text by calling SetImageAttribute() multiple times. There
  are too many subtle usages of this feature. The annoying printf
  introduced in 1.3.41 has been disabled.

# [1.3.41 (August 12, 2023)](#id8)

  Information about the Coverity status may be found at
  <https://scan.coverity.com/projects/graphicsmagick>.

Bug fixes:

* Blob: Immediately reject attempts to write blobs to formats which
  can not support blobs.
* TranslateTextEx(): An empty string argument should return an empty
  string rather than a NULL string.
* SetImageAttribute(): Fix bounds issue when concatenating string.
* JPEG: Do not set image resolution if the values provided are outside
  of the valid range.
* Fixes for NaN when reading formats based on floating point.
* HEIF: Fix reading images with rotation/transformation.
* BMP: Do not decode primaries or gamma unless colorspace is
  LCS\_CALIBRATED\_RGB. Add/correct bmp\_info.size "biSize" logic which
  decides if header chunks are present (or invalid).
* MNG: Fixes for resizing using X\_method 5.
* GM command (convert, montage, mogrify): Many command-line parser
  fixes/checks for invalid command line syntax which causes unexpected
  behavior, or core dumps.
* TopoL: Given that a writer is now provided, issues found in the
  reader (and writer) due to continual fuzz-testing have been fixed,
  as encountered.
* GetImageClippingPathAttribute(): Check for and use clipping path
  name (ID=2999) to get the real attribute name.
* ReadIPTCProfile(): Fix malformed IPTC data parsing.

New Features:

* TopoL: Now provides a writer.
* WPG: Now provides a writer.
* gm batch: Implement simple Test Anything Protocol (TAP) test
  counting and "ok N"/"not ok N" messaging.
* TIFF: Support '-define tiff:photometric=minisblack' and '-define
  tiff:photometric=miniswhite' to be able to adjust the sense used
  when writing bilevel TIFF images.
* TIFF: Require that TIFFTAG\_EXTRASAMPLES be used appropriately to
  indicate the intention of extra channels.
* utilities/tests/gen-tiff-images/genimages: Script for writing (and
  then reading) thousands (5568 permutations) of TIFF format variants.
* EXIF and PNG: Retrieve image orientation from EXIF (if present) and
  store in image.
* HEIF: Retrieve image orientation from EXIF and store in image.

API Updates:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* A CMake script is provided as an option for building the Visual
  Studio project generator, configure.exe.
* pkg-config files now consider static building.
* Unixish configure now uses Use pkg-config for libheif to ease static
  building.
* TclMagick: Integrated TclMagick build fixes (patches) targeting
  Unix-type systems.
* LibJXL: Compiles against development 0.9.0 API as existed on July
  8, 2023.
* The GraphicsMagick++-config script provides a --cxx option to
  reproduce the name of the C++ compiler which was used.
* The GraphicsMagick-config script provides a --cc option to reproduce
  the name of the C compiler which was used.

Behavior Changes:

* The ability to extend existing image attribute text by calling
  SetImageAttribute() multiple times with the same key is now
  deprecated, and will soon be removed. In the mean time, the
  annoying message "SetImageAttribute: Extending attribute value text
  is deprecated!" is printed to the standard error output to help
  expose code which is using this feature.

# [1.3.40 (January 14, 2023)](#id9)

Special Issues:

* GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
  volunteers. For several years now, the burden has entirely been on

  years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
  combined for 26 years already). It is not reasonable to expect

Security Fixes:

* DCX: Fixed heap overflow when writing more than 1023 scenes, and
  also eliminated use of uninitialized memory.

Bug fixes:

* GetMagickGeometry(): Fix a scaling issue where dimensions could be
  scaled down to zero.
* PCD: Handle writing image with a dimension of 1.
* PNG: When writing, use lower-case raw profile identifiers (e.g. 'Raw
  profile type xmp') because exiftool expects that.
* SUN: The sense of monochrome images was inverted. Fix scanline size
  calculation.
* WPG: Fix 20-year old bug in WPG header reading.

New Features:

* JXL: Decode and log extra channel information. This information is
  not yet used.
* PCX and DCX: Support writing uncompressed format (use -compress none
  for no compression).
* Added IM1, IM8, and IM24 magick aliases for the Sun Raster format
  since those are the historically correct extensions.

API Updates:

* AppendImageToList() now updates the image list pointer to be the
  image which was just added. Use GetFirstImageInList() when the
  pointer to the first image in the list is needed.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Jasper is updated to release 2.0.33.

* Visual Studio build possible with Visual Studio 2008 - 2022.
* Windows Inno Setup installer now installs Microsoft redistributables
  rather than using a side-by-side DLL configuration.

Behavior Changes:

* AppendImageToList() now updates the image list pointer to be the
  image which was just added. Use GetFirstImageInList() when the
  pointer to the first image in the list is needed.

# [1.3.39 (December 26, 2022)](#id10)

Special Issues:

* GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
  volunteers. For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
  me (Bob Friesenhahn). I have been sheparding the project for 20
  years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
  combined for 26 years already). It is not reasonable to expect
  someone with a full time job (and expecting to retire in a few
  years) to do all of the work.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project since
  February 4 2018 due to the contributions and assistance of Alex
  Gaynor and Paul Kehrer. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. Please consult the
  GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
  the oss-fuzz issues list for details.

Security Fixes:

* oss-fuzz: Several security fixes originating from oss-fuzz testing.
* ALL: Replace strcpy() with strlcpy(), replace strcat() with
  strlcat(), replace sprintf() with snprintf(). Prefer using bounded
  string functions. This change is made for the purpose of increasing
  safety than to address any existing demonstrated concern.

Bug fixes:

* Coverity: Several fixes for issues found by Coverity to reduce the
  number of reported issues back down to zero.
* Clang Analyzer 12: Fix most discovered issues.
* PNG: Fix possible use of uninitialized 'ping\_num\_trans' value in
  ReadOnePNGImage().
* MinGW: Eliminate overwrite of existing \_MSC\_VER value in MinGW compile.
* MNG: Fix heap-use-after-free in CloseBlob.
* MNG: Fix indirect leak in MagickMallocCleared().
* PS: Assure that 'bounds' structure is initialized.
* EPT: Assure that 'bounds' structure is initialized.
* HEIF: If heif\_image\_handle\_get\_metadata\_size() returns 0, then
  carrying on with reading image data.
* configure.ac: Fix Bashism in maintainer-mode check.
* TGA: Remove a defective validation of comment length, which blocked
  reading some sample TGA files from the "Encyclopedia Of Graphics
  File Formats" book. Monochromatic bilevel TGA can now be read and
  written. TGA "Footers" are now read and used when logging as well
  as converted to Image attributes.
* WebP: Add configure.ac updates to check for libsharpyuv so that
  builds with the development version work again.
* Visual Studio Build (VisualMagick): Fix project file generation.
  Improve portability of code for configure.exe.
* Fixed mixed encoding (non-UTF-8) errors in text and source files.
* DrawPrimitive(): Fix composition using "0,0" for image size. This
  became broken in GraphicsMagick 1.3.36.
* Blob API: Fixed SEEK\_END validation. SEEK\_END was not used before,
  but now it is.

New Features:

* AVIF: Support reading AVIF via libheif if it supports decoding AVIF
  (still no writer support).
* LOG: Added function IsEventLogged() to report if a particular event
  will be logged. Us this as much as possible throughout the software
  to replace use of IsEventLogging(). This avoids a possible
  performance hit if any logging is enabled at all and logging
  statements are executed which are filtered and produce no output.
* FITS: Support storing multiple scenes in one file (non-standard
  extension).
* JPEG: Optionally enable arithmetic coder in JPG images using
  '-define jpeg:arithmetic-coding=true'.
* JPEG: Add support for reading deep gray images.
* HEIF: Support reading ICC color profiles.
* Produce ASCII armored ".asc" format GPG signature files.
* Support reading directly from .bz2, .gz, .svgz, and .Z files
  (without creating a temporary file), if possible.

API Updates:

* Magick++: Provide a version of Image::colorMapSize() which is a
  'const' method. Continue to provide the non-const version in order
  to avoid an ABI change. The compiler should choose the appropriate
  version.

Feature improvements:

* HTML documentation generation based on Docutils is significantly
  updated and improved.
* PerlMagick: Added more sample input files and changed many reader
  tests to use hash signature rather than comparison to reduce the
  distribution size.
* Blob: The ReadBlobString() function has been re-written to perform
  better when reading from files.
* JXL: The JXL coder is updated to compile with what will likely
  become JXL 0.8.0. Support for 16-bit 'short' samples, 16-bit
  'float' samples, and 32-bit float samples added. Support for
  reading and writing ICC, EXIF, and XMP profiles added.
* MIME: GM "magick" to MIME mappings have been added for apng, avif,
  bmp, ico, and webp (regardless of if they are supported).
* XPM: The XPM reader performance is dramatically improved and is
  observed to be 32x faster when reading a medium-sized XPM file
  (e.g. the GraphicsMagick logo).
* XPM: Support reading "deep" images with more pallete entries than
  the maximum colormap size.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Update bundled libjasper to version 1.900.26. Please note that 4.0.0
  is the latest version at this time and fixes a great many security
  and stability issues which are present in 1.900.26.
* Update bundled libjpeg to version 9e.
* Update bundled libtiff to version 4.5.0.

Build Changes:

* MSVC: Added porting function to emulate C'99 snprintf for MSVC older
  than 2015.
* MSVC: Successfully compiles using Visual Studio 2008 and 2019.
  Compiles successfully using Visual Studio 2022 if optimization is
  disabled (otherwise there is an internal compiler error in effect.c).

Behavior Changes:

* None

# [1.3.38 (March 26, 2022)](#id11)

Special Issues:

* The FTP site ftp.graphicsmagick.org is now shut down due to a lack
  of bandwith, extremely abusive users (including from Google and
  customers of Amazon Web Services), and a lack of support from the
  user community. Another factor is that FTP support has been removed
  from popular web browsers. This is very unfortunate since the site
  served multiple usages, including providing a lot of historical data
  (e.g. related to PNG) which may not be available elsewhere.
* GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
  volunteers. For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
  me (Bob Friesenhahn). I have been sheparding the project for 20
  years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
  combined for 26 years already). It is not reasonable to expect
  someone with a full time job (and expecting to retire in a few
  years) to do all of the work.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due to
  the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, ??? issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and ?? issues remain
  open. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. Please consult the
  GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
  the oss-fuzz issues list for details.

Bug fixes:

* Documentation: Generator scripts in 'doc' directory now produce
  similar results using GNU sed and Solaris/Illumos sed and don't
  produce warnings.
* JNG: Fixes to error handling to avoid temporary file leaks and
  avoiding returning a broken image.
* JPEG: Always store embedded profiles in image, even if in 'ping'
  mode.
* MAT: Change from using 'int' for sizes/offsets to using 'size\_t' and
  check all related calculations for overload.
* MIFF: Fix heap buffer overflow which may be provoked in builds with
  BZLIB support.
* MogrifyImage() and Magick::Image::trim(): Trim requires
  NorthWestGravity.
* PICT: Fixed a heap overflow.
* PerlMagick: Fix issue that image fill attribute had its opacity
  reset to transparent so it could not be usefully set at image scope.
* Test Suite: Fixed portability issue related to 'sed' which broke
  utilities/tests/convert.tap test script.
* WPG: Fix incorrect TrX and TrY elements in CTM.

New Features:

* Added support for a 'Read' resource limit (e.g. '-limit read 5mb').
  This allows the user to specify a hard limit for how much data may
  be read from a file, read from a pipe, or decompressed from a file
  (e.g gzip or bzip2) before a hard error is reported. This resource
  limit is a useful alternative to completely disabling support for
  compressed files using the --disable-compressed-files option and it
  provides more protections as well.
* Added support for reading HEIF/HEIC format.
* Added support for reading and writing JPEG XL format.
* Support for JasPer 3.0.0 is completed. Upgrading to JasPer 3.0.0 is
  strongly recommended due to its many security fixes and integration
  with GraphicsMagick's resource-limited memory allocator.
* PNG: Support the define png:chunk-malloc-max=limit in order to allow
  reading PNG files which report "chunk data is too large" or to
  reduce the default limit.
* compare: Added support for the '-compress' option.
* compare: Added support for the '-auto-orient' option. This tries to
  assure that the two images are right-side up before comparing.

API Updates:

* Magick++: Support the new 'ReadResource' enumeration.

Feature improvements:

* JPEG: Implement more efficient way to append JPEG profile chunks.
* Resource Limited Memory: The resource limited memory allocator now
  maintains useful statistics such as a tally of the total number of
  octets moved by realloc.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* In maintainer mode, the configure script searches for a GnuPG 'gpg'
  program to use for signing snapshot releases and uses this to
  support PGP-signed development snapshots.

Behavior Changes:

* None

# [1.3.37 (December 12, 2021)](#id12)

Special Issues:

* The FTP site ftp.graphicsmagick.org is now shut down due to a lack
  of bandwith, extremely abusive users (including from Google and
  customers of Amazon Web Services), and a lack of support from the
  user community. Another factor is that FTP support has been removed
  from popular web browsers. This is very unfortunate since the site
  served multiple usages, including providing a lot of historical data
  (e.g. related to PNG) which may not be available elsewhere.
* The Microsoft Visual Studio build has not been updated for this
  release (although it does compile and the results do work fine) and
  I might not be providing any Windows installation packages
  corresponding to this release. The problem is that the third-party
  'delegate' libraries are out of date and they need to be updated
  since some of them are known to contain severe security
  vulnerabilities. Several third-party 'delegate' libraries now
  require real C'99 support, which means that Visual Studio 2015 or
  later would be required to build them. The 'configure' program used
  to build the Visual Studio project files needs to be updated since
  otherwise a 20 minute project upgrade cycle is needed when using
  Visual Studio 2019, and to make minor path changes to avoid a
  multitude of project-file warnings while building. The installation
  requirements for Visual Studio 2015 or later are different (related
  to run-time "redistributables", which are now very onerous) and so
  the Inno Setup installer needs some minor (or major) changes. Many
  pleas for assistance have been made (e.g. even to help with testing
  to see if the software executes at all) but thus far the Microsoft
  Windows user community has not been helpful with regards to the
  Microsoft Visual Studio build.
* GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
  volunteers. For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
  me. I have been sheparding the project for 19 years already (and
  contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick combined for 25 years
  already). It is not reasonable to expect someone with a full time
  job (and expecting to retire in a couple of years) to do all of the
  work.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due to
  the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 590 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 23 issues remain
  open (most of which are in third-party software such as development
  JasPer). The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. Please consult the
  GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
  the oss-fuzz issues list for details.

Bug fixes:

* CAPTION: Eliminate an assertion upon deallocation.
* CMYK: Fix broken reading of planar CMYK files (a regression since 1.3.27).
* ExecuteModuleProcess(): Add missing error reporting related to
  the -module command option.
* GIF: Handle GIF files where the 'opaque' index matches the number of
  colors by producing an extra colormap entry of transparent
  black. (SourceForge issue #649)
* JP2: Adaptations to compile cleanly with JasPer 2.0.20.
* META: Fix types used to prefer unsigned types where possible and to
  use 'size\_t' rather than 'int' for size values.
* MSL: A great many MSL parser fixes.
* Microsoft Windows: Detect and use Ghostscript point versions added
  after 9.52, after which the version number format was changed.
* PCX: Fix problem that 16-colors are used rather than 256-colors
  (SourceForge patch #65).
* PDF: Fix MediaBox dimensions (SourceForge patch #64 "Incorrect
  MediaBox in PDF export").
* PDF: Use appropriate memory deallocator for memory returned by
  StringToList(). (SourceForge issue #646)
* RGB: Fix broken reading of planar RGB files (a regression since
  1.3.27).
* TIFF: Fix double-charging for memory allocations (a regression since
  1.3.36).
* TIFF: Make sure that loops using TIFFReadScanline(), etc, do quit
  upon first reported error.
* WEBP: Enforce that embedded profiles provided by libWebP are not
  zero-sized.
* WEBP: Use SetImagePixelsEx() rather than GetImagePixelsEx() in
  reader (SourceForge patch #66).
* WriteBlob(): Use appropriate handle for bzip2.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* DisposeTypeToString(): New utility function to convert a DisposeType
  to a string.
* StringToDisposeType(): New utility function to convert a string to a
  DisposeType.

Feature improvements:

* JP2: Support building using development JasPer 3.0.0 and request
  that it use our managed-memory allocators for resource control.
* Pixel Cache: Memory cache implementation of pixel cache now uses
  resource limited memory allocator.
* Analyze filter module: Add OpenMP speed-ups.
* IsImagesEqual(): Allow comparing images when the 'matte' channel
  flag differs.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Remove bundled hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and mpeg2enc.exe.

Build Changes:

* Microsoft Windows: configure.ac fixes for gdi32 to depend on user32
  as well.
* Microsoft Windows: VisualMagick/All/All.vcproj.in updated to fix
  problem with not being able to load the 'All' project if the project
  supports the x64 target.
* Autotools build, many more TAP tests have been added, including to
  exercise all of the 'convert' commands.
* TIFF: Adaptations to compile cleanly for libtiff versions
  beyond 20201219.
* Magick++: Support compiling with C++'98 through C++'17.
* Autotools build, Add support for using an external
  'graphicsmagick\_snapshot\_copy' script to copy files for the
  'snapshot' target. This provides local control over how files are
  copied and where they are copied to.

Behavior Changes:

* TranslateTextEx(): If image resolution is impossibly small, then
  report the default resolution of 72 DPI, or the equivalent in
  centimeters if units is in pixels-per-centimeter.

# [1.3.36 (December 26, 2020)](#id13)

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due to
  the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 454 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
  benign build issues such as SourceForge Mercurial not working
  correctly) and 7 issues remain open (all of which are marked in an
  "unreproducible" state). The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. Please consult the
  GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
  the oss-fuzz issues list for details.
* WPG: Fixes for heap buffer overflow.

Bug fixes:

* ConstituteImage(): Set image depth appropriately based on the
  storage size specified by StorageType and QuantumDepth.
* GetImageBoundingBox(): Fix problem that MagickTrimImage with extreme
  fuzz values could produce an image with negative width.
* ImageToFile(): Improve error handling to avoid possible deferred
  deletion of temporary files, causing unexpected excessive use of
  temporary file space.
* JNG: Add validations for alpha compression method values and use
  this information to enforce decoding using the appropriate
  sub-format (rather than auto-detecting the format). Also, address
  memory leaks which may occur if the sub-decoder does something other
  than was expected.
* MagickCondSignal(): Improvements to conditional signal handler
  registration (which avoids over-riding signal handlers previously
  registered by an API user).
* ModifyCache(): Fix memory leak.
* ReadCacheIndexes(): Don't blunder into accessing a null pointer if
  the using code has ignored a previous error report bubled-up from
  SetNexus().
* MNG: When doing image scaling and the image width or height is 1
  then always use simple pixel replication as per the MNG
  specification.
* MVG: Fixes to 'push clip-path foo' and 'pop clip-path foo' parsing
  to eliminate a class of malign behavior.
* MVG: Place an aribrary limit on stroke dash polygon unit maximum
  length in order to avoid possibly rendering "forever".
* PCL: No longer attempt to handle reading HP PCL format via the
  external 'hp2xx' program since it seems worthless for that task.
* PS: Fix corrupt image when writing PseudoClass image with a colormap
  larger than two entries as bilevel.
* SVG: Memory leak fixes.
* SVG reader: Now support 'ping' support so the identify command works
  as expected.
* TIFF: WEBP compression only supports a depth of 8 so force that
  value.
* Wand MagickSetSamplingFactors(): Correct formatting of sampling
  factors string.

New Features:

* Logging is now fully programmable.
* DPX format: Support dpx:swap-samples-read define which behaves
  similar to dpx:swap-samples, but is only applied when reading, as
  well as dpx:swap-samples-write, which is only applied when
  writing. This provides for use when there is both reading and
  writing in the same operation (otherwise the final result was no
  effect!).

API Updates:

* magick/api.h: Add "magick/enum\_strings.h" to API headers.
* New log settings accessor C functions: SetLogDefaultFileName(),
  SetLogDefaultFormat(), SetLogDefaultOutputType(),
  SetLogDefaultLogMethod(), SetLogDefaultLimit(),
  SetLogDefaultGenerations(), SetLogDefaultEventType(). These
  functions allow a program to set the same parameters which may be
  set by loading a "log.mgk" function. If a default logging callback
  was provided via SetLogDefaultLogMethod() such that MethodOutput is
  used, then the search for a "log.mgk" is avoided entirely.
* New log settings accessor C++ functions: SetLogDefaultFileName(),
  SetLogDefaultFormat(), SetLogDefaultOutputType(),
  SetLogDefaultLogMethod(), SetLogDefaultLimit(),
  SetLogDefaultGenerations(), SetLogDefaultEventType(). These C++
  functions just pass through to the equivalent C functions and
  provide the same benefits.

Feature improvements:

* A simple resource-limit respecting memory allocator has been
  developed for internal use wherever arbitrarily-large amounts of
  memory might be requested. This will gradually be added wherever it
  appears to be needed. The memory resource limits are at the overall
  process level. The MVG/SVG rendering code is updated to use this
  new allocator. Almost all of the coders (image format
  readers/writers) have now been updated to use this new allocator.
  This means that '-limit memory 300MB' would be more complete and
  meaningful now. Temporary allocations by the image processing
  algorithms (other than for the images themselves) are still not
  accounted for in the resource limiting.
* MVG Renderer / DrawImage(): Use resource-limit respecting memory
  allocators for remaining large memory allocations.
* PNG writer: Don't skip optional Exif identifier code if it isn't present.
* DPX reader/writer: decode/encode of 10-bit packed DPX is now twice
  as fast due to code simplification.
* TIFF reader: Apply the same resource limits to TIFF tile sizes as
  apply to the image itself.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* configure.ac: Update syntax to avoid using deprecated syntax
  according to Autoconf 2.69. Also added copious m4 quoting.
* Magick++ Drawable base class no longer uses std::unary\_function when
  compiled using C++'17 or later, since this feature has been removed
  from the language.
* Support the configure option --disable-compressed-files to disable
  automatic decompress of gzip and bzip2 compressed files (e.g. files
  with extension 'gz' or 'bz2', and sometimes 'svgz', but sometimes
  posing as some other format). It turns out that there are some
  extremely compressed files (e.g. over 1000x compression ratio) which
  can take a long time to decompress and produce large temporary
  files. We currently normally wait for the whole file to be
  decompressed before decoding it. The only exception is for coders
  with native 'blob' support and which do not require seeking, and
  that the user forced forced the format by adding a magick prefix
  like "DPX:file.dpx" to avoid the automatic file format detection.
* Support the configure option --without-gs to disable reading PS,
  EPS, and PDF formats via an external Ghostscript delegate program.
  This corresponds to the HasGS definition in the source code.
* Support the configure option --without-gdi32 to support disabling
  use of the Microsoft Windows gdi32 library if it is not wanted.
* The Automake-based test suite now applies a memory limit of 128MB
  for the Q8, or 256MB for the Q16, or 512MB for the Q32 build, as
  well as setting a disk space limit of 0. The limits place an upper
  bound on the resources required, while assuring that tests do pass
  with resource limits applied, while also assuring that disk-based
  pixel-cache files are not used.

Behavior Changes:

* Previously the formatting settings from "log.mgk" were only used
  when writing to a file, or to the console, via a file handle. Now
  the log formatting has been normalized so that the settings provided
  by "log.mgk" (or SetLogDefaultFormat()) will always be used. It is
  possible this may result in some formatting changes.
* In the Windows Visual Studio build, the ProvideDllMain option is now
  disabled by default (can still be enabled) since it causes
  InitializeMagick() to be invoked prior to when the program's main()
  routine is called, thereby blocking configuration activities or use
  of InitializeMagickEx(). With this change it is even more
  imperative that InitializeMagick() be explicitly invoked by all
  programs using GraphicsMagick.

# [1.3.35 (February 23, 2020)](#id14)

Special Issues:

* It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
  library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
  process initialization overhead. This is noticed as unexpected
  slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
  medium sized files. The time to initialize the 'ICU' library is
  often longer than the time that GraphicsMagick would otherwise
  require to read the input file, process the image, and write the
  output file. If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make
  sure to use the modules build so there is only impact for file
  formats which require libxml2. Please lobby the 'ICU' library
  developers to change their implementation to avoid long start-up
  times due to merely linking with the library.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 398 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
  benign build issues) and 11 issues remain open.
  The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. There are too many
  fixes to list here. Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

Bug fixes:

* Fix broken definition of ResourceInfinity which resulted in that
  GetMagickResource() would return -1 rather than the maximum range
  value for the return type as documented. (problem added by the
  1.3.32 release).
* ModifyCache(): Re-open the pixel cache if the cache rows/columns do
  not match the owning image rows/columns.
* Fix DisplayImages() return status. The return status was inverted.
* HISTOGRAM: Histogram once again includes the histogram as a text
  comment. This became broken by previous security fixes.
* PICT: Fixed heap buffer overuns reported multiple sources.
* JNG: Detect when JPEG encoder has failed and throw an exception.
* MVG/DrawImage(): Performs even more parsing validations.
* Clang static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made based on
  problem reports by the Clang static analyzer.
* Visual Studio static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made
  based on problem reports by the Visual Studio 2019 static analyzer.
  Many of these may improve the robustness of 64-bit code.

New Features:

* GRADIENT/GradientImage(): Improved accuracy of gradient levels as
  well as dramaticaly improving performance. Output PseudoClass
  images if we can. Add support for using the image 'gravity'
  attribute as well as the "gradient:direction" definition to produce
  gradient vector directions corresponding to SouthGravity (the
  previously-existing default), NorthGravity, WestGravity,
  EastGravity, NorthWestGravity, NorthEastGravity, SouthWestGravity,
  and SouthEastGravity.

API Updates:

* InitializeMagickEx(): New function which may be used in place of
  InitializeMagick() to initialize GraphicsMagick. This
  initialization function returns an error status value, may update a
  passed ExceptionInfo structure with error information, and provides
  an options parameter which supports simple bit-flags to tailor
  initialization. The signal handler registrations are skipped if the
  MAGICK\_OPT\_NO\_SIGNAL\_HANDER flag is set in the options.

Feature improvements:

* Replace use of non-reentrant legacy POSIX functions with reentrant
  equivalents.
* Timing of image reads should now be very accurate. The timer was
  sometimes not stopped as soon as it should be.
* PICT: The PICT reader is working pretty good now. It handles all
  the PICT image files I have available to me.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* Visual Studio Build: Configure program now provides a checkbox to
  enable common optimizations for better performance.

Behavior Changes:

* POSIX Signals: Use the normal termination signal handler for SIGXCPU
  and SIGXFSZ so that ulimit or setrlimit(2) may be used to apply CPU
  (RLIMIT\_CPU) and output file size (RLIMIT\_FSIZE) limits with the
  normal cleanup, and without dumping core. Note that any output files
  currently being written may be truncated and files being written by
  external programs (e.g. Ghostscript) might be left behind unless
  they are to a temporary file assigned by GraphicsMagick.
* Some private string and integer constants were removed from the
  apparent library ABI. Some private functions were marked static and
  removed from the apparent library ABI. This is mentioned because
  someone is sure to notice and be concerned about it.
* The remaining private content in installed header files was moved
  into -private.h header files which are not installed. This should
  not be cause for concern but is mentiond because someone is sure to
  notice and be concerned about it.

  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 386 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz (some of which were
  benign build issues) and 376 of those issues have been resolved.
  The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. There are too many
  fixes to list here. Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

Bug fixes:

* DPS: Eliminate a memory leak.
* Debug Trace: Only output text to terminate an XML format log file if
  XML format is active.
* EXIF Parser: Detect non-terminal parsing and report an error.
* EXIF Parser: Eliminate heap buffer overflows.
* HuffmanDecodeImage(): Fix heap overflow in 32-bit applications.
* MAT: Implement subimage/subrange support.
* MVG: Address non-terminal loops, excessive run-time, thrown
  assertions, divide-by-zero, heap overflow, and memory leaks.
* OpenModule(): Now properly case-insensitive, as it used to be.
* PCX: Verify that pixel region is not negative. Assure that opacity
  channel is initialized to opaqueOpacity. Update DirectClass
  representation while PseudoClass representation is updated. Improve
  read performance with uncompressed PCX.
* PICT: Fix heap overflow in PICT writer.
* PNG: Fix validation of raw profile length.
* PNG: Skip coalescing layers if there is only one layer.
* PNM: Fix denial of service opportunity by limiting the length of PNM
  comment text.
* WPG: Avoid Avoid dereferencing a null pointer.
* WPG: Implement subimage/subrange support.
* WPG: Improve performance when reading an embedded image.
* Wand library: In MagickClearException(), destroy any existing
  exception info before re-initializing the exception info or else
  there will be a memory leak.
* XPM: Rquire that image properties appear in the first 512 bytes of
  the XPM file header.

New Features:

* Visual Studio build supports JBIG and WebP compression in TIFF format.

API Updates:

* None

Feature improvements:

* Compliles clean using GCC 9.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* bzlib: bzip is updated to 1.0.8 release.
* jbig: jbigkit is updated to 2.1 release.
* lcms: lcms2 is updated to 2.9 release.
* libxml: libxml2 is updated to 2.9.10 release.
* png: libpng is updated to 1.6.37 release.
* tiff: libtiff is updated to 4.1.0 release.
* webp: libwebp is updated to the 1.0.3 release.
* zlib: zlib is updated to 1.2.11 release.
* TIFF: Now also supports reading JBIG-compressed TIFF, and
  reading/writing WebP-compressed TIFF. A number of libtiff feature
  options which are now commonly enabled were disabled and are now
  enabled by default.

Build Changes:

* MinGW: Static and shared library builds were not working. Only the
  modules build was actually working!
* Python scripts related to the build (enabled by
  --enable-maintainer-mode) are now compatible with Python 3.
* Now supports using Google gperftools tcmalloc library for the memory
  allocator. This improves performance for certain repetitive
  work-loads and heavily-threaded algorithms.
* Configure now reports the status of zstd (FaceBook Zstandard)
  compression in its configuration summary.
* TclMagick: Address many issues mentioned by SourceForge issue #420
  "TclMagick issues and patch".

Behavior Changes:

* PNG: Post-processing to convert the image type in the PNG reader
  based on a specified magick prefix string is now disabled. This can
  (and should) be done after the image has been returned.
* Trace Logging: The compiled-in logging default is always to stderr,
  which may be over-ridden using log.mgk as soon as it is loaded.
* Windows Build: Search registry key HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER as well as
  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE when searching for Ghostscript. By following the
  procedure documented in SourceForge bug 615 "GhostScript
  installation check", this allows for local user installations
  without "administrator" privileges.

# [1.3.33 (July 20, 2019)](#id16)

Special Issues:

* It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
  library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
  process initialization overhead. This is noticed as unexpected
  slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
  medium sized files. The time to initialize is often longer than the
  time to read the input file, process the image, and write the output
  file. If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make sure to
  use the modules build. Please lobby the 'ICU' library developers to
  change their implementation to avoid long start-up times due to
  merely linking with the library.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 353 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 338 of those
  issues have been resolved. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. There are too many
  fixes to list here. Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.
* Documentation has been added regarding security hazards due to
  commands which support a '@filename' syntax.
* MontageImages(): Fix wrong length argument to strlcat() when
  building montage directory, which could allow heap overwrite.

Bug fixes:

* PNG: Pass correct size value to strlcat() in module registration
  code. This bug is noticed to cause problems for Apple's OS X and
  Linux Alpine with musl libc. This fixes a regression introduced by
  the 1.3.32 release.
* Re-implement command-line utility '@' file inclusion support for
  -comment, -draw, -format, and -label which was removed for
  the 1.3.32 release. The new implementation is isolated to
  command-line utility implementation code rather than being deeply
  embedded in the library and exposed in other usage contexts. This
  fixes a regression introduced by the 1.3.32 release.
* CAPTION: The The CAPTION reader did not appear to work at all any
  more. Now it works again, but still not very well.
* MagickXDisplayImage(): Fix heap overwrite of windows->image.name and
  windows->image.icon\_name buffers. This bug has surely existed since
  early GraphicsMagick releases.
* MagickXAnimateImages(): Fix memory leak of scene\_info.pixels.
* AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor(): Fix compilation under Cygwin. This
  fixes a regression introduced by the 1.3.32 release.
* PNG: Fix saving to palette when mage has an alpha channel but no
  color is marked as transparent.
* Compilation warnings in the Visual Studio WIN64 build due to the
  'long' type being only 32-bits have been addressed.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* None

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* None

Behavior Changes:

* Support for '@' file inclusion support for -comment, -draw,
  -format, and -label has been restored.

# [1.3.32 (June 15, 2019)](#id17)

  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.
* BMP reader: Fix heap overflow in 32-bit build due to arithmetic
  overflow. Only happens if limits are changed from defaults.
* BMP reader/writer: Improve buffer-size calculations to guard against
  buffer overflows.
* DIB reader: Reject files which claim more than 8-bits per pixel but
  also claim to be colormapped.
* DIB reader/writer: Improve buffer-size calculations to guard against
  buffer overflows.
* MIFF reader: Detect end of file while reading RLE packets.
* MIFF reader: Fix heap overflow (for some files using RLE
  compression) caused by a typo in the code.
* MAT writer: Added missing error handling to avoid heap overflow.
* MNG reader: Fixed a small heap buffer overflow.
* SVG reader: Fixed a stack buffer overflow.
* TGA writer: Fix heap overflow when image rows/columns are larger
  than 65535.
* TIFF reader: Rationalize tile width/height to reject large tile
  sizes which are much larger than the image dimensions.
* TIFF reader: Apply memory resource limits to strip and tile allocations.
* WMF reader: Fixed a division by zero problem.
* XWD reader: Many heap buffer overflows and uses of uninitialized data were fixed.
* Pixel cache: Now apply resource limits to pixel nexus allocations
  using the same limits (total pixels, width, height, memory) as
  applied to the whole image since some requests are directly
  influenced by the input file. More tests are added for arithmetic
  overflow. Care was taken to minimize performance impact due to the
  many extra checks.

Bug fixes:

* See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.
* Fixed include order of magick/api.h vs wand/wand\_symbols.h.
* WriteImage(): Eliminate use of just-freed memory in
  clone\_info->magick when throwing exception due to no support for
  format.
* Magick++/lib/Magick++/Drawable.h: Fix use of clang diagnostic syntax.
* DIB: Preserve PseudoClass opaque representation if ICO mask is opaque.
* JPEG reader: Restore ability to access detailed image properties
  while in 'ping' mode.
* JPEG reader: Base test for "Unreasonable dimensions" on original
  JPEG dimensions and not the scaled dimensions.
* JPEG reader: Allow input files to have a compression ratio as high
  as 2500. Extremely compressed files were being rejected.
* FreeType renderer: Fixed a memory leak.
* PDF writer: Fixed a memory leak.
* PDF writer: Fixed a thread safety problem.
* PICT reader: Fix a thread safety problem.
* Exception reporting: Throwing an exception was not thread safe. Now it is.
* Exception reporting: Handle the case where some passed character
  strings refer to existing exception character strings.
* Command-line parser now does not attempt to read a list of filenames
  from a file in '@name' syntax if the path '@name' exists.
  Previously it would attempt to read a list of file names from 'name'
  even if '@name' did exist.
* Rendering: Short-circuit path parsing and return and error
  immediately if an error occurs.

New Features:

* Added support for writing the Braille image format (by Samuel
  Thibault).
* WebP writer: Support WebP 'use\_sharp\_yuv' option ("if needed, use
  sharp (and slow) RGB->YUV conversion") via -define
  webp:use-sharp-yuv=true.
* The version command output now reports the OpenMP specification
  number rather than just the integer version identifier.

API Updates:

* ReallocateImageColormap() added to re-allocate an existing colormap.
* Some improperly-exposed globals are now static as they should have
  been.

Feature improvements:

* Microsoft Windows timing information now uses
  QueryPerformanceFrequency() and QueryPerformanceCounter() for
  increased precision.
* The 'benchmark' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed
  time indication.
* The 'time' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed time
  indication.
* The logging facility now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of time
  resolulution
* Dcraw: When QuantumDepth is greater than 8, pass -6 option to dcraw
  so that it returns a 16-bit/sample image.
* Dcraw: If Dcraw supports TIFF format, then request TIFF format in
  order to be able to acquire more metatdata.
* Scale algorithm: Eliminate artifacts when scaling an image with
  semi-transparent pixels.
* Library metrics: The number of shared library relocations and the
  amount of initialized data has been signficantly reduced by
  following recommendations from Ulrich Drepper's document [How To
  Write Shared Libraries](https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf).

  For comparison, these are the differences in library metrics between
  the 1.3.31 and 1.3.32 releases for a simple shared library with all
  features supported:

  | Release | Relocations | Initialized Data | Total Size |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1.3.31 | 12,432 | 506,496 | 3,587,227 |
  | 1.3.32 | 747 | 127,936 | 3,033,279 |

  and these are the differences in library metrics between 1.3.31 and
  1.3.32 for a shared library using the modules option (recommended!)
  with all features supported:

  | Release | Relocations | Initialized Data | Total Size |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1.3.31 | 5,370 | 176,784 | 1,940,620 |
  | 1.3.32 | 367 | 119,472 | 1,825,651 |

  As can be seen, the number of relocations was extreme and has been
  reduced to reasonable levels while also diminishing the amount of
  initialized data and the total size of the library/program. Most of
  the remaining initialized data (106,648 bytes) and some of the
  relocations (65 relocations) may be attributed to the optional X11
  animate/display/import support.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* The test suite now passes even if no fonts are found.
* Configure script does better at finding Windows fonts on non-Windows systems.
* The configure script now supports the option --with-mtmalloc to
  enable use of the mtmalloc library as found on Solaris-derived
  systems.

Behavior Changes:

* AnnotateImage(): No longer implicitly call TranslateText() since
  this is not suitable for most use-cases and causes additional
  performance impact. The API user can perform such translations in
  advance on the text string using TranslateText() if need be.

# [1.3.31 (November 17, 2018)](#id18)

Special Issues:

* Firmware and operating system updates to address the Spectre
  vulnerability (and possibly to some extent the Meltdown
  vulnerability) have substantially penalized GraphicsMagick's OpenMP
  performance. Performance is reduced even with GCC 7 and 8's
  improved optimizers. There does not appear to be anything we can do
  about this.

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 292 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 279 of those
  issues have been resolved. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. There are too many
  fixes to list here. Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.

Bug fixes:

* See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.
* CINEON: Fix unexpected hang on a crafted Cineon image. SourceForge
  issue 571.
* Drawing recursion is limited to 100 and may be tuned via the
  MAX\_DRAWIMAGE\_RECURSION pre-processor definition.
* Fix reading MIFF files using legacy keyword 'color-profile' for ICC
  color profile as was used by ImageMagick 4.2.9.
* Fix reading/writing files when 'magick' is specified in lower case.
  This bug was a regression in 1.3.30.

New Features:

* TIFF: Support Zstd compression in TIFF. This requires libtiff
  4.0.10 or later.
* TIFF: Support WebP compression in TIFF. This requires libtiff
  4.0.10 or later.

API Updates:

* MagickMonitor() is marked as deprecated. Code should not be using
  this function any more.

Feature improvements:

* The progress monitor callbacks (registered using MagickMonitor() or
  MagickMonitorFormatted()) are serialized via a common semaphore
  rather than via critical sections in OpenMP loops. OpenMP loops are
  updated to use OpenMP 'atomic' and 'flush' to update shared loop
  variables rather than using a OpenMP 'critical' construct, reducing
  contention. Performance on some targets is observed to have been
  improved by this change.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* There was already a 'compare' command installed with the
  '--enable-magick-compat' configure option was used but it did not
  function. Now it functions. There was no compare command in
  ImageMagick 5.5.2 and this compare command is only roughly similar
  to a compare command in some subsequent ImageMagick release.
* Removed Remove Ghostscript library support (--with-gslib) from
  configure script. The 'HasGS' pre-processor defines which were
  enabled by this remain in the source code so it is still possible to
  use this library if absolutely necessary (e.g. CPPFLAGS=-DHasGS
  LIBS=-lgs).
* No longer explicitly link with the OpenMP library when it will be
  supplied already due to CFLAGS.

Behavior Changes:

* JPEG: Libjpeg-turbo is allowed 1/5th the memory resource limit
  provided for Graphicsmagick via the cinfo->mem->max\_memory\_to\_use
  option, which is part of the IJG JPEG API/ABI, but usually not
  supported there. This feature works for libjpeg-turbo 1.5.2 and
  later. Limiting the memory usage is useful since libjpeg-turbo may
  otherwise consume arbitrary amounts of memory even before
  Graphicsmagick is informed of the image dimensions.
* JPEG: The maximum number of JPEG progressive scans is limited to 50.
  Otherwise some technically valid files could be read for almost
  forever.

# [1.3.30 (June 23, 2018)](#id19)

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 238 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 230 of those
  issues have been resolved. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. There are too many
  fixes to list here. Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.
* SVG/Rendering: Fix heap write overflow of PrimitiveInfo and
  PointInfo arrays. This is another manefestation of CVE-2016-2317,
  which should finally be fixed correctly due to active
  detection/correction of pending overflow rather than using
  estimation.

Bug fixes:

* Many oss-fuzz fixes are bug fixes.
* Drawing/Rendering: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).
* MIFF: Detect end of file while reading image directory.
* SVG: Many more fixes by Gregory J Wolfe (see the ChangeLog).
* The AlphaCompositePixel macro was producing wrong results when the
  output alpha value was not 100% opaque. This is a regression
  introduced in 1.3.29.
* TILE: Fix problem with tiling JPEG images because the size request
  used by the TILE algorithm was also causing re-scaling in the JPEG
  reader. The problem is solved by stripping the size request before
  reading the image.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* The size of PrimitiveInfo (believed to be an internal/private
  structure but in a header which is installed, has been increased to
  store a 'flags' argument. This is intended to be an internal
  interface but but may be detected as an ABI change.

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* The oss-fuzz build script (fuzzing/oss-fuzz-build.sh) now includes
  many delegate libraries such as zlib, libpng, libtiff, libjpeg, and
  freetype, resulting in more comprehensive testing. The Q16 build is
  now being tested rather than the 'configure' default of Q8.

Behavior Changes:

* JPEG: The JPEG reader now allows 3 warnings of any particular type
  before giving up on reading and throwing an exception. This choice
  was made after observing files which produce hundreds of warnings
  and consume massive amounts of memory before reading the image data
  has even started. It is currently unknown how many files which were
  previously accepted will be rejected by default. The number of
  allowed warnings may be adjusted using '-define
  jpeg:max-warnings=<value>'. The default limit will be adjusted
  based on reported user experiences and may be adjusted prior to
  compilation via the MaxWarningCount definition in coders/jpeg.c.

# [1.3.29 (April 29, 2018)](#id20)

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
  to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
  2018, 180 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 173 of those
  issues have been resolved. The issues list is available at
  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list> under search term
  "graphicsmagick". Issues are available for anyone to view and
  duplicate if they have been in "Verified" status for 30 days, or if
  they have been in "New" status for 90 days. There are too many
  fixes to list here. Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
  file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
  for details.
* JNG: Require that the embedded JPEG image have the same dimensions
  as the JNG image as provided by JHDR. Avoids a heap write overflow.
* MNG: Arbitrarily limit the number of loops which may be requested by
  the MNG LOOP chunk to 512 loops, and provide the '-define
  mng:maximum-loops=value' option in case the user wants to change the
  limit. This fixes a denial of service caused by large LOOP
  specifications.

Bug fixes:

* Many oss-fuzz fixes are bug fixes.
* DICOM: Pre/post rescale functions are temporarily disabled (until
  the implementation is fixed).
* JPEG: Fix regression in last release in which reading some JPEG
  files produces the error "Improper call to JPEG library in state
  201".
* ICON: Some DIB-based Windows ICON files were reported as corrupt to
  an unexpectedly missing opacity mask image.
* In-memory Blob I/O: Don't implicitly increase the allocation size
  due to seek offsets.
* MNG: Detect and handle failure to allocate global PLTE. Fix divide
  by zero.
* DrawGetStrokeDashArray(): Check for failure to allocate memory.
* BlobToImage(): Now produces useful exception reports to cover the
  cases where 'magick' was not set and the file format could not be
  deduced from its header.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* Wand API: Added MagickIsPaletteImage(), MagickIsOpaqueImage(),
  MagickIsMonochromeImage(), MagickIsGrayImage(), MagickHasColormap()
  based on contributions by Troy Patteson.
* New structure ImageExtra added and Image 'clip\_mask' member is
  replaced by 'extra' which points to private ImageExtra allocation.
  The ImageGetClipMask() function now provides access to the clip mask
  image.
* New structure DrawInfoExtra and DrawInfo 'clip\_path' is replaced by
  'extra' which points to private DrawInfoExtra allocation. The
  DrawInfoGetClipPath() function now provides access to the clip path.
* New core library functions: GetImageCompositeMask(),
  CompositeMaskImage(), CompositePathImage(), SetImageCompositeMask(),
  ImageGetClipMask(), ImageGetCompositeMask(), DrawInfoGetClipPath(),
  DrawInfoGetCompositePath()
* Deprecated core library functions: RegisterStaticModules(),
  UnregisterStaticModules().

Feature improvements:

* Static modules (in static library or shared library without
  dynamically loadable modules) are now lazy-loaded using the same
  external interface as the lazy-loader for dynamic modules. This
  results in more similarity between the builds and reduces the fixed
  initialization overhead by only initializing the modules which are
  used.
* SVG: The quality of SVG support has been significantly improved due
  to the efforts of Greg Wolfe.
* FreeType/TTF rendering: Rendering fixes for opacity.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

Behavior Changes:

# [1.3.28 (January 20, 2018)](#id21)

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* BMP: Fix non-terminal loop due to unexpected bit-field mask value
  (DOS opportunity).
* PALM: Fix heap buffer underflow in builds with QuantumDepth=8.
* SetNexus() Fix heap overwrite under certain conditions due to using
  a wrong destination buffer. This issue impacts all 1.3.X releases.
* TIFF: Fix heap buffer read overflow in LocaleNCompare() when parsing
  NEWS profile.

Bug fixes:

* DescribeImage(): Eliminate possible use of null pointer.
* GIF: Fix memory leak of global colormap in error path.
* GZ: Writing to gzip files with the extension ".gz" was not working
  with Zlib 1.2.8.
* JNG: Fix buffer read overflow (a tiny fixed overflow of just one byte).
* JPEG: Promoting certain libjpeg warnings to errors caused much more
  problems than expected. The promotion of warnings to errors is
  removed. Claimed pixel dimensions are validated by file size before
  allocating memory for the pixels.
* IntegralRotateImage(): Assure that reported error in rotate by 270
  case does immediately terminate processing.
* MNG: Fix possible null pointer reference related to DEFI chunk
  parsing. Fix minor heap read overflow (constrained to just one
  byte) due to an ordering issue in a limit check. Fix memory leaks
  in error path.
* WebP: Fix stack buffer overflow in WriteWEBPImage() which occurs
  with libwebp 0.5.0 or newer due to a structure type change in the
  structure passed to the progress monitor callback.
* WPG: Memory leaks fixed.

New Features:

* None

API Updates:

* InterpolateViewColor(): This function now returns MagickPassFail (an
  unsigned int) rather than void so that errors can be efficiently
  reported.
* The magick/pixel\_cache.h header is updated to add deprecation
  attributes such that code using GetPixels(), GetIndexes(), and
  GetOnePixel() will produce deprecation warnings for compilers which
  support them. These functions will not be removed in the 1.3.X
  release series and when they are removed, pre-processor macros will
  be added so a replacement function is used instead. There is a
  long-term objective to eliminate functionally-redundant pixel cache
  functions to only the ones with the best properties since this
  reduces maintenance and may reduce the depth of the call stack
  (improving performance).

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None

Build Changes:

* PerlMagick: Sanitize PACKAGE\_VERSION so that Perl is not confused by
  any trailing alpha character.
* Improved symbol renaming due to adding --enable-symbol-prefix. Some
  symbols (for static const strings) were not being included in the
  renaming.

Behavior Changes:

* None

# [1.3.27 (December 9, 2017)](#id22)

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* CMYK: Fix heap overwrites in raw CMYK writer. Fix heap overwrites
  in raw CMYK reader (noticed when doing montage).
* GIF: Assure that global colormap is initialized.
* DescribeImage(): Fix possible heap write overflow when describing
  visual image directory. Fix possible heap read overflow while
  accessing heap data, and possible information disclosure while
  describing the IPTC profile.
* DICOM: Fix huge memory allocation based on bogus length value (DOS
  opportunity).
* DrawDashPolygon(): Fix heap out of bounds read in render code.
* GRAY: Fix heap overwrites in raw GRAY reader (noticed when doing
  montage).
* JNG: Fix heap overruns. Fix assertions.
* JNG: Prevent a crash due to zero-length color\_image while reading a
  JNG image. (CVE-2017-11102). Reject JNG files with unreasonable
  dimensions given the file size (avoid DOS).
* JNX: Fix DOS due to excessive memory allocations with corrupt file.
* JPEG: Do not allocate backing image pixels until a scanline has been
  successfully read. Avoids DOS opportunity with suitably
  manufactured file.
* MAP: Fix null pointer dereference or segmentation violation.
* MAT: Fix heap write overflow.
* MNG: Reject over-large (65k by 65k) image. Fix heap overwrites.
* PAM: Fix heap buffer overflow in PAM writer for 1 bit/sample + alpha.
* PICT: Fix excessive memory allocation due to malformed image file.

* SUN: Fix heap read overflow. Fix DOS due to excessive memory
  allocations with corrupt file.
* SVG: Fix heap write overflow.
* TIFF: Use heuristics to avoid DOS (excessive memory use) due to
  false claims by input file. It is possible that this may reject

  allocated scanline buffer due to the NumberOfObjectsInArray() macro
  rounding up rather than down.
* UIL: Fix heap overwrite in writer.

  read.
* Validate path entries in the MAGICK\_CODER\_MODULE\_PATH and
  MAGICK\_FILTER\_MODULE\_PATH environment variables and convert all
  paths to real paths if possible. This avoids possible use of
  relative paths to load modules (a possible security issue), or the
  possibility of adding a directory which was in the path, but
  missing, and may improve efficiency by removing non-existent paths.

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Libtiff is updated to libtiff 4.0.9.

Build Changes:

* JPEG/PNG: The SETJMP\_IS\_THREAD\_SAFE definition is used to determine
  if setjmp/longjmp are thread safe. If these interfaces are thread
  safe, then concurrent reads/writes are possible. This definition is
  false for Solaris but true for Linux. JPEG and PNG will be fully
  concurrent if this definition is enabled.

Behavior Changes:

* PALM: PALM writer is disabled.
* ThrowLoggedException(): Capture the first exception at
  ErrorException level or greater, or only capture exception if it is
  more severe than an already reported exception.

  data. (CVE-2017-10799).
* JNG: Fix memory leak when reading invalid JNG image (CVE-2017-8350).
* MAT: Fix excessive use of memory (DOS issue) due to continuing
  processing with insufficient data and claimed large image

* EXIF orientation was not being properly detected for some files.
* -frame: The import command -frame handling was improperly
  implemented and was using already freed data.
* GIF: Fixes for "Excessive LZW string data" problem.
* Magick++: Bug fixes to PathSmoothCurvetoRel::operator() and
  PathSmoothCurvetoRel::operator().
* PAM: Support writing GRAYSCALE PAM format.

  TclMagick under Linux is fixed.
* TclMagick: Fix parser validatation in magickCmd() to avoid crash
  given a syntax error.
* TIFF: Fix for reading old JPEG files (avoids "Improper call to JPEG
  library in state 0. (LibJpeg).").
* TXT: Fixed memory leak.
* XCF: Error checking is improved.

New Features:

* EXIF rotation: Support is added such that the EXIF orientation tag
  is updated when the image is rotated.
* MAT: Now support reading multiple images from Matlab V4 format.
* Magick++: Orientation method now updates orientation in EXIF
  profile, if it exists.

Feature improvements:

* None

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* TIFF: Updated to libtiff 4.0.8.

Build Changes:

* TclMagick: Updated configure to use latest TEA tcl.m4 version 3.10.
  Support for AM\_DISTCHECK\_CONFIGURE\_FLAGS so that 'make distcheck'
  remembers configuration options, and also to uninstall pkgIndex.tcl.
* VisualMagick Configure: A 'quantum' command line argument is added
  to set the default quantum depth in the wizard drop-down list. This
  This allows setting the quantum depth when the /nowizard argument
  was supplied.

Behavior Changes:

* The installer for the Windows build no longer includes IMDisplay
  (simple display program), ImageMagickDLL, and PerlMagick for
  ActiveState Perl. These are still available to build from the
  source tree. All of these depend on proprietary components.

# [1.3.25 (September 5, 2016)](#id24)

Special Issues:

* None

Security Fixes:

* EscapeParenthesis(): I was notified by Gustavo Grieco of a heap
  overflow in EscapeParenthesis() used in the text annotation code.
  While not being able to reproduce the issue, the implementation of
  this function is completely redone. This issue was assigned
  CVE-2016-7447 after the release.
* Utah RLE: Reject truncated/absurd files which caused huge memory
  allocations and/or consumed huge CPU. Problem was reported by
  Agostino Sarubbo based on testing with AFL. This issue was assigned
  CVE-2016-7448 after the release.
* SVG/MVG: Fix another case of CVE-2016-2317 (heap buffer overflow) in
  the MVG rendering code (also impacts SVG). This issue (remaining
  part) was assigned CVE-2016-7446 after the release.
* TIFF: Fix heap buffer read overflow while copying sized TIFF
  attributes. Problem was reported by Agostino Sarubbo based on
  testing with AFL. This issue was assigned CVE-2016-7449 after the
  release.

Bug fixes:

* GetToken(): Fix obscure bug (read beyond end of string buffer)
  noticed while parsing a MVG file. This problem was reported by
  Gustavo Grieco.
* MVG rendering: Fix undesired hard errors when some objects were
  drawn outside of the image bounds. Requests to draw objects
  entirely outside of the image should be silently ignored.
* MVG/SVG rendering: Fix gradient size sanity checks which were
  causing gradient requests to fail. Due to a design weakness in that
  gradient images allocate resources rather than being computations at
  point of use, the maximum gradient image size is now hard-limited to
  5000x5000 pixels until the design problem is fixed. Some SVG icons
  (as small as 8x8 pixels) authored using Inkscape request absurdly
  huge gradients. Gradient sizes as large as 20,000x20,000 have been
  observed in SVG icon files delivered by packages on an Ubuntu Linux
  system.
* SVG: Fix some memory leaks which occur on parsing error.

New Features:

* None

Feature improvements:

* ElapsedTime(): Use clock\_gettime() (when available with default
  linkage) to obtain elapsed time.
* DescribeImage(): Provide 6 digits of seconds precision in in elapsed
  time output. Previously the resolution was rounded up to a full
  second.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* webp: Updated bundled libwebp to release 0.5.1.
* libxml: Updated bundled libxml2 to release 2.9.4.
* lcms: Updated bundled lcms2 to release 2.8.
* png: Update bundled libpng to release 1.6.24.

Build Changes:

* OpenMP is properly configured for clang 3.8 using its own '-lomp'
  rather than '-lgomp'.

Behavior Changes:

* SVG: Some SVG files may be rejected due to absurdly large gradient
  requests.
* The 'identify' and 'info' functionality only shows the pixel read
  rate if image was not read in 'ping' mode. Provide 6 digits of
  seconds precision in in elapsed time output.

# [1.3.24 (May 30, 2016)](#id25)

Special Issues:

* A shell exploit (CVE-2016-5118) was discovered associated with a
  filename syntax where file names starting with '|' are intepreted as
  shell commands executed via popen(). Insufficient sanitization in
  the SVG and MVG renderers allows such filenames to be passed through
  from potentially untrusted files. There might be other ways for
  untrusted inputs to produce such filenames. Due to this issue,
  support for the feature is removed entirely.
* A shell exploit was discovered associated with the gnuplot delegate
  and which is triggered by the 'gplt' entry in delegates.mgk. A
  remote exploit is possible if the attacker can cause a provided SVG
  or MVG file to be rendered (or the user opens a provided file). The
  gnuplot program must be installed in order for the exploit to be
  successful. It is strongly recommended to remove this entry in all
  delegates.mgk files.
* Due to [GCC bug 53967](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967), several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
  may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
  enabled for floating point math (-mfpmath=sse) if the GCC option
  -frename-registers is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
  experience the problem since they use '387 math. It is not clear in
  what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
  the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe. Other compilers do not
  suffer from this bug. Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
  embarrassing performance bug.

Security Fixes:

* BLOB: Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or
  writing output to a shell command, by prefixing the specified
  filename (containing the command) with a '|'. This feature provided
  a remote shell execution opportunity.
* DIB: Fixed out of bounds reads. Added more header validations.
* JNG: File size limits are enforced.
* MAT: Fixed denial of service opportunity. Fix hang on corrupt deflate stream.
* META: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.
* MIFF: Fixed thrown assertion.
* MSL: Ignore the file extension on MSL files. It is necessary to add
  a "msl:" prefix to MSL files to read the as an image.
* MVG: No longer assume that files ending with extension ".mvg" are
  MVG files. MVG parsing does more validity checking on its input.
  Assure that enough PrimitiveInfo structures are allocated in advance
  to support a given vector path (heap overflow problem).
* PCX: Fixed unreasonable memory allocation due to intentionally
  corrupt file.
* PDB: Fixed a heap buffer overflow and out of bounds read.
* PICT: Fixed an out of bounds write.
* PS: Ghostscript is now always run with -dSAFER for safer execution.
* PSD: Fixed segmentation violations, heap buffer overflows, and out
  of bounds writes.
* RLE: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.
* ReadImages(): Fixed a possible infinite recursion due to a crafted input file.
* RotateImage(): Fixed thrown assertion.
* SGI: Fixed out of bounds writes.
* SUN: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.
* SVG: Fixed heap and stack buffer overflows, as well as segmentation
  violations (CVE-2016-2317 and CVE-2016-2318). Also fixed endless
  loop, unexpectedly large memory allocation, divide by zero, and
  recursion issues.
* TIFF: Fixed an assertion while reading. Fixed benign heap overflow.
* TMP: Adding a "tmp:" prefix to a filename no longer removes the file
  since this seems dangerous.
* VIFF: Fix excessive memory allocation with intentionally corrupted input file.
* XCF: Fixed a heap buffer overflow.
* XPM: Fixed several heap buffer overflows, and out of bound
  reads/writes. Also fixed a case of excessive memory allocation.
* delegate.mgk: The default delegate.mgk file has been pared down in
  order to reduce security exposure.
* gnuplot ('gplt' delegate in delegates.mgk): Support for rendering
  gnuplot files is removed since the format is inherently insecure.
* File names: File names starting with a '|' character are no longer
  interpreted as shell commands to be executed as input or output.

Bug fixes:

* BMP: Fix reading 24-bit Microsoft BMP which claims to have a
  colormap.
* FILE: file:// URLs are properly supported now (they never worked
  before).
* JP2: It is now possible to write lossless JPEG 2000 "JP2" format.
* SVG: Support font-size "medium".

New Features:

* Blob I/O C APIs: Added signed versions of short and long Read/Write
  functions.
* FILE: file:// URLs are properly supported now (they never worked
  before).
* MAT: Matlab V4 is now partially supported.
* Magick++: Added double-precision xResolution() and yResolution()
  methods to support setting the horizontal and vertical resolution
  with double floating point precision.
* Mogrify now supports a -preserve-timestamp option to preserve file
  access and modification timestamps.

Feature improvements:

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* Updated bundled libpng to release 1.6.19.
* Updated bundled libwebp to release 0.4.4.
* Update bundled libxml2 to release 2.9.3.
* Update bundled freetype to release 2.6.2.

Build Changes:

* Added --enable-broken-coders configure option to enable file
  format support which may be broken or cause security issues. The
  PSD format is now classified as "broken" (until it is fixed).

Behavior Changes:

* PSD format is not included in the build by default.
* Files ending with ".mvg" and ".msl" are not assumed to be image
  files by default.
* File names starting with '|' are no longer treated as shell
  commands.
* Gnuplot and POV delegate support is removed from the default
  delegate.mgk file.

# [1.3.23 (November 7, 2015)](#id26)

Special Issues:

* Due to [GCC bug 53967](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967), several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
  may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is

  what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
  the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe. Other compilers do not
  suffer from this bug. Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
  embarrassing performance bug.

Security Fixes:

* ScaleImage(): While not strictly a security issue, requesting to
  scale an image while retaining the original number of rows will lead
  to a program crash or memory corruption due to double-free.

Bug fixes:

* ScaleImage(): Fix problem with new width/height match original
  (regression added by 1.3.22).
* ScaleImage(): Fix double-free when new rows matches original rows
  (regression added by 1.3.22).
* MinGW build fix related to eliminating a sleep() macro which
  conflicts with a MinGW-provided inline sleep() function.
* PNG: Issue a warning instead of an error when attempting to read a
  PNG file containing a zero-length profile. This allows the file to
  be read.
* identify: Fix problem in that identify -format "%A" (to test if
  transparency is supported in image) does not always produce the
  correct results.

New Features:

* None.

Feature improvements:

* None.

Performance Improvements:

* None.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* None.

Build Changes:

* Configure: Removed CFLAGS and LDFLAGS deduplication code which
  caused problems for user-provided CFLAGS and LDFLAGS which added and
  then removed compiler/linker options. Specifically, this fixes a
  problem with creating OS X universal builds.
* Configure: Add tests for 'ps2write' and 'eps2write' which are
  available in recent Ghostscript.

Behavior Changes:

* None

# [1.3.22 (October 4, 2015)](#id27)

Thanks:

* Coverity: We thank Coverity for providing free service for free
  software projects, and thank Jodie Cunningham for getting the
  project set up in Coverity.

Special Issues:

* Due to [GCC bug 53967](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967), several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
  may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is

  what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
  the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe. Other compilers do not
  suffer from this bug. Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
  embarrassing performance bug.
* Magick++: Any libraries or applications using Magick++ should be
  rebuilt in order to use this new release. Libraries and
  applications will be able to continue to use prior versions of
  Magick++ without being re-built, while benefiting from updated C
  libraries, provided that the system supports library versioning.

Security Fixes:

* General Coverity fixes. Some might have security consequences.
* Ghostscript options concatenation is more secure against buffer
  overflow.
* Windows: Built-in random number generator is now salted using
  CryptGenRandom(). This improves the robustness of the temporary
  file allocator.

Bug fixes:

* Coverity Fixes: Large amounts of fixes due to Coverity static
  analysis. See the ChangeLog and Mercurial for details. Coverity now
  reports zero issues.
* General: Fix problems with reading filenames that include a colon.
* General: Fixed performance problem with sub-image path extraction
  when there are many files in the directory.
* General: Add missing options in utility help messages.
* BMP: Reader was wrongly rejecting RLE-compressed files as being too
  small (regression added in 1.3.21 release).
* BMP: Fix inverted alpha channel when writing BGRA8888 format.
* DrawAffineImage(): Fix problem with negative x offset.
* DrawAffineImage(): Fix problem that sometimes output rows are skipped when using OpenMP.
* EXIF: Properly validate GPS\_OFFSET.

* MIFF: Memory leak fixes.
* MIFF: MIFF reader failed to read some MIFF headers properly.
* MIFF: Detect buffer overrun attempt while reading zip compressed data.
* PDF: Set image frame scene ids appropriately.
* PNG: Memory leak fixes.
* PS: Set image frame scene ids appropriately.
* PTIF: Mark reduced frames as SubfileType 0x2 instead of 0x1.
* SetImageProfile(): Avoid crash given NULL profile pointer.
* TIFF: Fix reading Old JPEG and YCbCr sample images from libtiff
  pics-3.8.0.tar.gz image file collection.
* TIFF: Disable matte channel for compression types which don't
  support it.
* XPM: Memory leak fixes.
* XWD: Memory leak fixes.

New Features:

* GRAYA: New subformat for gray coder which supports alpha channel.
  Format specifiers "R", "G", "B", "A", "C", "M", and "Y" may now be
  used to save and restore the associated channel using the same raw
  format as "GRAY".
* Magick++: Image::repage() method added to support resetting 'page'.
* PDF: Added '-define pdf:stop-on-error=true' optoin to cause PDF
  reading to quit immediately upon any error.
* Subframe specification: Now specific PS and PDF pages may be
  selected, including re-ordering.

Feature improvements:

* PALM: Still a work in progress. Closer to working using netpbm's
  implementation as a reference.

Performance Improvements:

* None.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

* dcraw: Update bundled dcraw to release 9.26.0.
* lcms: Update bundled lcms2 to release 2.7.

Behavior Changes:

Magick++: adaptiveThreshold() now accepts a 'double' value and the
previous version of the method (using 'unsigned int') is deprecated.
The STL function-object equivalent of the deprecated method is removed
entirely.

> * Magick++: Image resolutionUnits() was not always returning correct
>   value.
> * Magick++: Locking has not been working properly since the code was
>   written in 1998. Apparently the issue has not been significant
>   enough to cause run-time issues.
> * ICO: Windows icon reader is now much more robust.
> * MIFF: Reader now quits with an error if zip or bzip2 stream is
>   corrupted.
> * MAT: Fix memory leaks.
> * PALM: Reader now reads various input formats (up to version 2)

>   default signal handling is to remove any temporary files and quit.
>   An informative message is printed for signals other than SIGINT.
> * SUN: Sun raster reader was not completely robust. Now it is.
> * SWF: Fix pixel cache access errors in 'ping' mode.
> * Text annotation: An empty text string is no longer treated as an

> * Text annotation: Fix regression added in 1.3.19 which caused
>   spurious drawing errors to be produced while rendering with text
>   when all of the text is off the left-hand side of the image.
> * TIFF: Fix unreliable reading JBIG compressed files by forcing use
>   of strip reader rather than sometimes using scanline reader (which
>   libtiff's JBIG codec does not support).
> * TIFF: Fix reading or writing planar min-is-white or min-is-black
>   images with an associated alpha channel.
> * WebP: WebP writer now writes truely lossless output when
>   requested.

New Features:

> * compose: Supports composite operator names similar to the major
>   \*Magick brand, without losing any compatibility with previous
>   naming.
> * ICO: Windows ICO reader now supports reading PNG-encoded files.
> * Magick++ Geometry: New methods limitPixels() and fillArea() to
>   support '@' and '^' geometry qualifiers. This enhancement breaks
>   the ABI due to previous use of inline methods and no place to put
>   the new flags.
> * Magick++ Image::extent(): New method to place image on sized
>   canvas of constant color using gravity.
> * Magick++ Image::formatExpression(): New method format a string
>   based on a format similar to command-line -format.
> * Magick++ Image::resize(): New method to resize image specifying
>   geometry, filter, and blur.
> * Magick++ STL extentImage: New function object to invoke image
>   extent method.
> * Magick++ Image::quiet(). New method which blocks (ignores)
>   warning exceptions when passed a 'true' argument.
> * Resource limits: Added support for image Width and Height limits.
>   Default image Width and Height limits are based on the range of a
>   32-bit signed integer, even for 64-bit builds which may have
>   sufficient numeric range to image an entire galaxy. Limits may be
>   increased as desired.
> * TIFF: Use define tiff:ignore-tags to ignore tags in 'corrupted'
>   files with unknown and invalid tags. Use to read TIFF files which
>   otherwise can not be read due to errors.
> * TIFF: Use '-define tiff:report-warnings=true' to enable that
>   warnings reported by libtiff are thrown as warning exceptions so
>   that they may be caught or will be reported at the gm
>   command-line.
> * Windows Exceptions: A handler is registered (due to calling
>   InitializeMagick()) to capture Windows Exceptions in a similar
>   manner to the existing POSIX signal handler. If an application is
>   using the library and wants to provide its own Windows exception
>   handling, then it should make any changes after invoking
>   InitializeMagick().

Feature improvements:

> * None.

Performance Improvements:

> * None.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

> * PNG: Update bundled libpng to 1.6.16. Resolves known security
>   issues.
> * FreeType: Update bundled Freetype to 2.5.4. Resolves known
>   security issues.
> * WebP: Update bundled WebP to 0.4.2 release.
> * WebP is auto-linked in Visual Studio.

Build Changes:

> * WebP is not included in the build when building with Visual Studio
>   6 (1998 vintage compiler!) since it requires more modern C.

Behavior Changes:

> * AVI: Support for this format is removed since the implementation
>   was worthless.
> * TIFF: Now uses YCbCr encoding when JPEG compression is requested
>   for an RGB image.

# [1.3.20 (August 16, 2014)](#id29)

Special Issues:

> * Due to [GCC bug 53967](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967), several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
>   may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
>   enabled for floating point math (-mfpmath=sse) if the GCC option
>   -frename-registers is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
>   experience the problem since they use '387 math. It is not clear
>   in what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed
>   by the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe. Other compilers do
>   not suffer from this bug. Please lobby the GCC project to fix
>   this embarrassing performance bug.

Security Fixes:

> * No security issues were reported or fixed.

Bug fixes:

> * Compilation: No longer undefine \_\_attribute\_\_ since this may be
>   used by system or compiler headers and cause problems.
> * BMP: Alpha channel from BMP3 format was inverted.
> * PNG: Fix round-trip repeatability issue (due to rounding
>   algorithm) with modern versions of libpng. Prefer the less
>   accurate method which does not alter the image.
> * PNG: Fix some memory leaks in error-handling paths.
> * PNM: Scaling of alpha in sub-ranged pixels is fixed.
> * Wand API: Removed development debug fprintf which causes each
>   drawing primitive to be printed to stderr.
> * PS, PS2, PS3, PDF: Only use resolution from image or -density if
>   units were properly specified. Without units, resolution is
>   worthless.
> * PS, PS2, PS3, PDF: Use resolution from image if it appears to be
>   valid.
> * WebP: Fix inverted return status which caused failure to be
>   reported instead of success.
> * Rotation clipping/shearing errors for short wide images at some
>   angles are fixed.
> * -geometry: Deal with resize geometry missing width or height
>   (e.g. '640x' or 'x480') by substituting the missing value with one
>   which preserves the image aspect ratio. This has been documented
>   to be supported since almost the dawn of GraphicsMagick but was
>   not actually supported until now.
> * -geometry: Support '>' and '<' qualifiers with '@' qualifier to
>   specify if image should be resized if larger or lesser than given
>   area specification.

New Features:

> * Wand API: MagickSetImageGravity() - New function to set image
>   gravity.
> * Wand API: MagickGetImageGravity() - New function to get image
>   gravity.
> * Wand API: MagickSetImageMatte() - New function to set the image
>   matte channel enable flag.
> * Wand API: MagickGetImageMatte() - New function to read the image
>   matte channel enable flag.
> * Wand API: MagickSetImageGeometry() - New function to set the image
>   geometry string.
> * Wand API: MagickGetImageGeometry() - New function to get the image
>   geometry string.
> * Wand API: MagickOperatorImageChannel() - New function to apply an
>   operator to an image channel.
> * Magick++ API: New Image::thumbnail() method for fast image
>   resizing, particularly to make thumbnails.
> * Core C API: Added SetLogMethod() to allow an application/library
>   to specify a function to be called for logging.
> * Clang/LLVM: Provide support for clang/llvm attribute and builtin
>   specifiers similar to that provided for GCC.
> * OpenMP: OpenMP native locking and thread specific data is
>   supported via a configuration option (is not the default). This
>   offers a "pure" OpenMP compilation mode. No real value for this
>   compilation mode has been observed yet but it seems worthy to
>   support.
> * Coders: Added BrokenCoderClass to mark coders which often
>   malfunction or are not very useful in their current condition.
> * Composition: Added HardLight composition operator, which is now
>   used by PSD and XCF formats, and available via command line,
>   Magick++ API, PerlMagick API, and Wand API.
> * Composition: Added ScreenCompositePixels composition operator.
> * Composition: Added missing Photoshop separable compositing
>   operations, Overlay, Exclusion, ColorBurn, ColorDodge, SoftLight,
>   LinearBurn, LinearDodge, LinearLight, VividLight, PinLight,
>   HardMix.
> * +set: Command line utilities now support +set to remove an
>   existing image attribute.
> * -format: Support additional format specifiers 'g', 'A', 'C', 'D',
>   'G', 'H', 'M', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'T', 'U', 'W', 'X', and '@', similar
>   to the major brand.
> * -operator: New quantum operators ThresholdBlackNegateQuantumOp and
>   ThresholdWhiteNegateQuantumOp. These correspond to -operator
>   "Threshold-Black-Negate" and "Threshold-White-Negate".
> * TIFF: Now support setting the TIFF "Software" tag for users who do
>   not want to admit to using GraphicsMagick.
> * WebP: All of the WebP encoder encoder options are now supported
>   by -define arguments.

Feature improvements:

> * Pixel interpolation quality is greatly improved, with minimal
>   impact on performance. Pixel interpolation now also works well
>   given an alpha channel.
> * WebP: WebP support is now prepared to compile with most WebP
>   library versions and supports all features except for those
>   pertaining to "RIFF" container support.

Performance Improvements:

> * Non-integral image rotation performance has been improved by about
>   40%, with lower memory usage as well.
> * GradientImage: Update image is\_grayscale and is\_monochrome flags
>   based on gradient color properties.

Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:

> * PNG: Libpng 1.6.12 - June 12, 2014.
> * JPEG: libjpeg 9a of January 19, 2014.
> * FreeType: FreeType 2.5.3 of March 6, 2014.
> * WebP: webp 0.4.0 of January 20, 2013.
> * zlib: zlib 1.2.8 of April 28, 2013.

Build Changes:

> * --without-threads no longer disables use of OpenMP. Use the
>   already existing option --disable-openmp to disable OpenMP.
> * Makefiles: Include paths are now exceedingly pedantic to make sure
>   that only the required directories are included.
> * VisualMagick configure: Improve configure program so that it is
>   possible to select QuantumDepth, OpenMP, and 64-bit build via
>   configure dialog boxes as well as options on the command line.
>   Also automatically detects and deals with similarly named files in
>   subdirectories so that WebP support can now build successfully.

Behavior Changes:

> * MultiplyCompositePixels: Multiply composition now uses SVG
>   interpretation of how alpha should be handled. No longer does a
>   simple multiply of alpha channel.
> * Composition: The Difference, Darken, Lighten, and HardLight
>   composition operators were modified to support alpha in their
>   computations.
> * PNG: Using -optimize no longer triggers palette and depth
>   optimizations since their implementations have been problematic.

# [1.3.19 (December 31, 2013)](#id30)

Security Fixes:

> * EPT: Fix crash observed when Ghostscript fails to produce useful
>   output. This was particularly noticeable when Ghostscript was not
>   installed. This crash could be used to cause denial of service.
> * PNG: With libpng 1.6.X, avoid a crash while copying a PNG with a
>   "known incorrect ICC profile". This crash could be used to cause
>   denial of service.

Bug fixes:

> * Build: Fix cross-compilation for MinGW64 on Linux build machine.
> * Build: configure FreeType test no longer insists that
>   <freetype/freetype.h> can be included.
> * CMS profile: Only delete the CMS transform if it is non-null.
>   Fixed assertion observed when lcms returned a null profile and
>   GraphicsMagick attempted to deallocate it.
> * Drawing: Improve error handling logic so that drawing returns
>   quickly on pixel access errors rather than plowing on ahead. This
>   avoids problems with SVGs which take seemingly forever to render.
> * Drawing via C/C++ APIs: BevelJoin no longer causes a MVG parsing
>   error.
> * EPT: Fix crash observed when Ghostscript fails to produce useful
>   output. This was particularly noticeable when Ghostscript was not
>   installed.
> * OpenMP: Revert use of omp\_set\_dynamic() since it caused
>   performance issues when using GCC's GOMP implementation and the
>   number of threads to use is specified.
> * EXIF profile: Support the SubjectArea EXIF tag.
> * MIFF writer: PseudoClass format was written incorrectly for depth
>   greater than 8.
> * MIFF writer: RLE compressed format used inverted alpha from the
>   other subformats contrary to the MIFF specification.
> * MIFF reader: Fixes to be able to read MIFF written by
>   ImageMagick 6.X, including DirectClass grayscale images (except
>   for RLE compressed).
> * Mosaic: Fixed unsigned underflow problem with -mosaic when page
>   offset is negative and exceeds image width or height, resulting in
>   assertions, out of memory errors, or pixel cache limit errors.
> * PDF: Consistently initialize Image page width and height to image
>   width and height. While general to all of GraphicsMagick, this
>   change is to assure that the PDF writer computes page dimensioning
>   consistently. PDF page dimensioning was wrong if the image had
>   been resized with -geometry "100%".
> * PAM: Fix MAXVAL scaling when reading PAM images. PAM was only
>   working correctly for images with 256 or 64k levels.
> * PNM: PGM "P2" format writer wrote bad output for 8-bit depth.
> * PNG: With libpng 1.6.X, avoid a crash while copying a PNG with a
>   "known incorrect ICC profile".
> * PNG: Q8 GM build now correctly reads 16-bit PNG files.
> * TIFF writer: Try to avoid writing more than 32k strips per image
>   by increasing rows-per-strip since some programs fail to read
>   images with more than 32k strips per image.
> * TIM reader: PSX TIM reports 8-bit depth (rather than 16).
> * TTF font rendering: Improve FreeType rendering error logic so that
>   rendering returns immediately on pixel access errors rather than
>   plowing on ahead.
> * TTF font rendering: Support rendering UTF-8 up to 21-bit code
>   points. Was only supporting 16-bit code points.
> * Wand API: DrawSetStrokeDashArray() / DrawGetStrokeDashArray(), fix
>   failure to work properly due to this code path never being tested.
> * Windows Ghostscript: 64-bit GraphicsMagick no longer requires both
>   32-bit and 64-bit builds of Ghostscript to be installed in order
>   to read Postscript and PDF formats.
> * XPM reader: Reported depth now depends on the colormap rather than
>   always claiming to be 16-bit.

New Features:

> * JPEG: Add support for writing 'XMP' profile.
> * PNM: As a simple non-standard extension to the standard PNM and
>   PAM formats, support writing and reading 32-bit sample depth.
>   Writing such files is only supported by the Q32 build although
>   they may be read by any build.
> * WebP: Now supports reading and writing Google's WebP format. This
>   feature is not currently supported by the Windows Visual Studio
>   build.

Feature improvements:

> * Pixel composition based on BlendCompositePixel() is enhanced to
>   completely eliminate under-color from the blending if the
>   under-pixel is fully transparent. Also blends based on the
>   average opacity of both pixels rather than only the over-pixel.
>   This change did not result in any change in the GM test suite
>   results but it is possible that there could be some negative
>   impact from it. Please report any issues noticed which are due to
>   this change.
> * X11 display: For DirectClass image, use ThumbnailImage() rather
>   than SampleImage() when creating the panner icon to improve the
>   quality of the image.

Performance Improvements:

> * PNG: ping a PNG faster by avoiding reading the image data.

Windows Delegate Updates:

> * Updated IJG JPEG library to release 9.
> * Updated PNG library to release 1.6.8.
> * Updated lcms2 library to release 2.5.
> * Updated libxml2 library to release 2.9.1.
> * Updated FreeType library to release 2.5.2.

Behavior Changes:

> * MIFF: Now writes PseudoClass images correctly when depth is
>   greater than 8. This impacts the reader, which will not be able
>   to read previously written incorrect format correctly. Images
>   like this should be very rare. The solution is to use an older
>   GraphicsMagick version to convert such images to a valid storage
>   format (with a depth of 8) so that they may be read with this
>   version.
> * MIFF: Now writes RLE-compressed RGBA images with correct
>   alpha. This impacts the reader, which will not be able to read
>   previously written incorrect format correctly. Images like this
>   should be very rare. A solution is to use an older GraphicsMagick
>   version to use a compression algorithm other than RLE so that they
>   are read correctly with this version. Another solution is to
>   process problematic images with '-operator Opacity Negate 0' to
>   invert the alpha channel.
> * TIFF: Returns DirectClass images by default for MINISWHITE and
>   MINISBLACK TIFF formats (rather then colormapped).
> * Windows: Also search c:gsfonts for Ghostscript font files. This
>   search path is normally hard-coded into Ghostscript binaries and
>   is a convenient place to put fonts so they may be shared by
>   multiple Ghostscript versions.
> * XPM: Now limits color resolution to 16-bits, even with Q32 build.

# [1.3.18 (March 10, 2013)](#id31)

Security Fixes:

> * None.

Bug fixes:

> * Fixed bug with format substitutions if input string ends with a
>   single '%'.
> * BMP: Fixed an old bug with decoding chromaticity primaries.
> * PNG: Fixed reading of interlaced images. Fix reading of sub-8-bit
>   palette and grayscale images. Some PNG sub-formats were written
>   incorrectly. Fix crash in PNG8 writer if image colors happened to
>   be non-zero but image was not actually colormapped.
> * PNG: Configure script now also searches for libpng versions 16 and
>   17.
> * TIFF: Fix a crash which was noticed when writing RGBA separated
>   (planar) format.
> * --enable-symbol-prefix was not prefixing all of the C
>   symbols. Some core C library functions were not prefixed. This
>   option applies to the Wand library API as well now.
> * C API: When input is from a user-provided file descriptor, the
>   file position is restored after reading the file header bytes.
>   Previously the file position was rewound to the beginning of the
>   file. This allows reading embedded image data from the current
>   offset in a file, and allows continuing to use the stream after
>   GraphicsMagick has returned the image.
> * C API: It is now possible to invoke CloseBlob() multiple times.
> * display: Display was supposed to respond to +/-usePixmap, but was
>   not. It was responding to +/-use\_pixmap. Now it responds to both.
> * Windows/VisualMagick: Fix building GraphicsMagick with Intel ICC
>   compiler driven by Visual Studio Professional 2012.
> * Windows: Avoid a crash and produce a useful diagnostic if
>   Ghostscript is needed but not yet installed.

New Features:

> * GM utility: New 'batch' command was contributed by Kenneth Xu
>   which supports executing any number of other GM utility
>   sub-commands in a single invocation in a sort of "batch" script.
>   Input may be piped from standard input, from a specified file, or
>   from a 'GM >' command prompt. This utilities front-end allows any
>   other program/script to drive 'gm' using a co-process model and
>   speeds up execution by eliminating utility start-up/shut-down
>   time.
> * WIN64 (64-bit Windows): Windows 64-bit is now officially supported.
> * convert/mogrify: Now support -auto-orient to automatically rotate
>   the image upright for viewing based on its current orientation
>   setting. Also support -orient to support setting the current
>   image orientation. Please note that the orientation property of
>   EXIF profiles is not yet updated so the EXIF profile will be wrong
>   after using -auto-orient.
> * C API: AutoOrientImage(), new function to automatically orient
>   the image so that it is upright for normal viewing.
> * Wand API: MagickGetImagePage()/MagickSetImagePage(), new functions
>   to support getting and setting the image page size and offsets.
> * PNG: Added PNG48 and PNG64 support. Added PNG00 support (png
>   encoder that inherits its color-type and bit-depth from the input,
>   if the input was a PNG datastream).

Feature improvements:

> * GraphicsMagick TAP tests may now be run stand-alone using Perl's
>   'prove' TAP test driver.

Performance Improvements:

> * Detection of glob specifications in file names is more efficient.

Windows Delegate Updates:

> * None.

Behavior Changes:

> * ltdl: Libltdl is no longer bundled. Libltdl must be previously
>   installed on the system in order to build the modules
>   configuration.
> * AppendImages() now converts subsequent images to the colorspace of
>   the first image, and no longer converts the first image to RGB.
>   Instead, it is assumed the user knows what she/he is doing.
> * SetImageColorRegion() no longer automatically converts the image
>   to RGB. The user is responsible for assuring that the provided
>   color is in the same colorspace as the image.

# [1.3.17 (October 13, 2012)](#id32)

Security Fixes:

> * PNG: Fix for CVE-2012-3438. The Magick\_png\_malloc function in
>   coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 6.7.8-6 does not use the proper
>   variable type for the allocation size, which might allow remote
>   attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PNG
>   file that triggers incorrect memory allocation.
> * Automake (derived): Fix for CVE-2012-3386: The "make distcheck"
>   rule in GNU Automake before 1.11.6 and 1.12.x before 1.12.2 grants
>   world-writable permissions to the extraction directory, which
>   introduces a race condition that allows local users to execute
>   arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

Bug fixes:

> * PNG: Reading sub-8-bit palette images is fixed (images looked
>   stretched).
> * SVG: Fixed bug which allowed MVG and SVG files with long vector
>   paths to crash the software.
> * SVG: Ignore XML headers rather than rendering them as text.
> * MVG/SVG/WMF/-draw: It is now possible to draw a plain ','
>   character.
> * WMF: Fixed a bug which caused wrong centered-text placement.
> * import: Return status was inverted.
> * configure: Don't force that liblzma is used just because libtiff
>   is used.

New Features:

> * The configure script now supports a --enable-quantum-library-names
>   option to enable that shared library name includes quantum depth
>   to allow shared libraries with different quantum depths to
>   co-exist in same directory (only one can be used for development).
> * JNX: Support is added for reading the Garmin proprietary Image
>   Format.
> * BMP: Support an alpha channel in uncompressed 32-bit BMP.

Feature improvements:

> * -lat: The adaptive threshold algorithm is replaced with a new
>   algorithm which scales linearly (rather than quadratically) with
>   area size.
> * Tests: Test suite is re-written to use TAP-based tests.
> * GIF: Reader tries to be better at detecting and reporting
>   failures.

Performance Improvements:

> * -lat: Adaptive threshold is much faster with large area sizes.

Windows Delegate Updates:

> * Dcraw 9.16 is now included in the build (with JPEG and JPEG2000
>   support).
> * Libxml2 is updated to the 2.9.0 release.
> * Libtiff is updated to the 4.0.3 release.
> * Lcms2 is updated to the 2.4 release.
> * Libpng is updated to the 1.5.13 release.

Behavior Changes:

> * Loading modules is only supported for the modules build.
>   Previously any build using shared libraries could load modules.
> * Bundled libltdl is now configured as 'installable' rather than
>   'convenience'.
> * -enhance: Only filter based on color channels (ignore opacity).
> * BrowseDelegate: Web browser (for viewing help information) now
>   defaults to 'xdg-open', but if it is not found, then configure
>   will search for firefox, google-chrome, mozilla (in that order).

# [1.3.16 (June 24, 2012)](#id33)

Security Fixes:

> * Don't translate 'comment' and 'label' attributes if the request is
>   made while a file is being read. Only translate such attributes
>   if they come from the command line or API user.

Bug fixes:

> * SWT: SWT reader suffered from a number of implementation errors
>   which caused it not to work any more. Works again.
> * XBM: Fix memory leak observed when reading file in 'ping' mode.
> * Support -trim on images which use a consistent (single color)

# [1.3.15 (April 28, 2012)](#id34)

Security Fixes:

> * Libpng in Windows build is updated to 1.5.10 release. Provides a
>   fix for CVE-2011-3048.

Bug fixes:

> * PNG - fixed problem with bit depth when the encoder decides to
>   write RGBA instead of indexed PNG.
> * Fixed some temporary file leaks which were caused by the temporary
>   file name being automatically extended to include a scene number,
>   and therefore fail to be deleted.

New Features:

> * Added '+noise random' and '-operator noise-random' to 'convert'
>   and 'mogrify'. This modulates the existing image data with
>   uniformly random noise.
> * Added -strip option in composite, convert, mogrify, and montage to
>   remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.
> * Added -repage option to composite, convert, mogrify, and montage
>   subcommands to reset or adjust the current image page offsets
>   based on a provided geometry specification.
> * New C function StripImage() to remove all profiles and text
>   attributes from the image.
> * New C function ResetImagePage() to adjust the current image page
>   canvas and position based on a relative page specification.
> * C functions GenerateDifferentialNoise(), AddNoiseImageChannel(),
>   QuantumOperatorRegionImage(), AddNoiseImage() updated to support
>   RandomNoise enumeration.
> * New C++ Image method strip(), and unary function stripImage() to
>   remove all profiles and text attributes from the image.
> * XCF format now respects image subimage and subrange members so
>   that returned image layers may be selected.
> * The INFO coder (e.g. output file "info:-") now respects the
>   -format option so that its output may be adjusted identically to
>   how -format works for 'identify'.
> * TclMagick now supports Random noise.

Feature improvements:

> * C function ThumbnailImage() now allows the user to override the
>   filter used, but still defaults to using the box filter.

Performance Improvements:

> * None

Behavior Changes:

> * No longer add a printf-style scene formatting specification to
>   filenames which do not have one and no longer automatically
>   operate in 'adjoin' mode in such cases. If multiple numbered
>   files are intended to be output, then add +adjoin to the command
>   line and use an output filename specification similar to
>   "image-%d.jpg". Output files are now completely specified and
>   predictable but this may break some existing usages which
>   anticipate the automatic file numbering.

# [1.3.14 (February 25, 2012)](#id35)

Security Fixes:

> * Windows bundled libpng updated to the 1.5.9 release, which fixes
>   the dire CVE-2011-3026 buffer overrun bug.

Bug fixes:

> * EMF format : Fixed wrong module mapping which caused EMF reading
>   to not work under Windows.
> * TGA format: Assume that 32-bit TGA files have an alpha channel,
>   even if they are not marked as such.
> * XCF format: Fix reading XCF which is comprised of different sized
>   layers.
> * JPEG & CineonLog: Convert RGB-compatible colorspaces
>   (e.g. CineonLog) to RGB by default since that was the case prior
>   to release 1.3.13.
> * RAW formats: Small memory leak in dcraw module was fixed.
> * Resize: ResizeImage() was ignoring its resize filter argument and
>   was using the filter setting from the Image structure instead.
> * The mirror virtual pixel method was broken.

New Features:

> * Open64 Compiler Suite: Version 5.0 is fully supported.
> * Wand API: Added MagickExtentImage().
> * MEF RAW: Mamiya Photo RAW "MEF" format is now supported.

Feature improvements:

> * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.
> * PNG library: Updated libpng to 1.5.9 release.
> * TIFF library: Updated libtiff to 4.0.1 release.
> * Zlib library: Updated to zlib 1.2.6 release.

Performance Improvements:

> * Despeckle algorithm (-despeckle) is many times faster.

Behavior Changes:

> * DPX format: Original file endianness is preserved by default.

# [1.3.13 (December 24, 2011)](#id36)

Security Fixes:

> None

Bug fixes:

> * In I/O blob, don't rewind already open file handle passed to
>   OpenBlob() since we don't know the intended state of this file
>   handle, and because it prevents appending to an existing file.
> * In AppendImageProfile(), don't leak profile buffer while appending
>   a chunk to an existing profile.
> * Fix deadlock in ClonePixelCache() which was caused by using the
>   same semaphore pointer in the source and destination images.
> * Removed bogus SyncBlob() code which sometimes caused a crash and
>   was not useful.
> * Fixed crash or hang which occured when the user entered CONTROL-C
>   while threaded code was being executed.
> * Fix core dump in AcquireOneCacheViewPixelInlined() when the image
>   is in CMYK space.
> * In MontageImages (montage), fix crash observed with "-geometry
>   x+0+0".
> * The TIFF reader was crashing for images which use the
>   TIFFTAG\_OPIIMAGEID tag.
> * AppendImages() (-append) was failing when only one image was
>   provided.
> * The animate, display, and identify commands now report any
>   error only once, and then proceed to the next file name rather
>   than quitting.
> * Don't change the locale settings in InitializeMagick() since this
>   may cause problems for international users. API users are still
>   responsible for assuring that locale settings don't break floating
>   point parsing and output (i.e. floating point decimal needs to be
>   '.' rather than ',').
> * RPM build is fixed (PerlMagick build was broken).
> * RPM build installs documentation to expected places on Red Hat
>   type systems.
> * Fixes for usage with OpenSolaris.
> * DESTDIR is supported by PerlMagick build.
> * The matte channel was not being properly enabled or respected for
>   TXT images.
> * InitializeMagick() and DestroyMagick() are now fully thread safe.
> * When a shear angle was zero, the shear request was being
>   ignored entirely.
> * In DispatchImage(), the K channel was always output as black for
>   "CMYK" specification unless the image matte flag was True.
> * MATLAB fixes.
> * PNG fixes.
> * PCL fixes for printing bi-level image on Konica-Minolta printers.
> * EPT error handling fixes.
> * JPEG reader was sometimes truncating large IPTC profiles.
> * JPEG writer now handles errors properly rather than allowing
>   libjpeg to exit the program (or hanging if driven by Magick++).
> * JPEG reader now treats an unhandled EXP marker as a warning rather
>   than a hard error.
> * File open errors are now reliably reported.
> * Improved rendering precision when using the drawing APIs.
> * For the Magick++ Image backgroundColor(), borderColor(), and
>   matteColor() methods, preserve the opacity part of the
>   user-specified color.

New Features:

> * Add support for drawing text using a bitmap font.
> * benchmark command supports a -stepthreads option to execute the
>   specified command with an increasing number of threads to measure
>   how an algorithm benefits from threading. This mode includes a
>   column to show the speedup compared with one thread, and the
>   Karp-Flatt metric
> * Added support for invoking "gs-cmyk" and "gs-cmyka" entries in
>   delegates.mgk when ColorSeparationType or ColorSeparationMatteType
>   is requested. These cause Ghostscript to always output CMYK PAM
>   format (even if the input file was not in CMYK format).
> * EXIF profiles are preserved when writing JPEG files.
> * The -mosaic command now respects the composition option specified
>   by -compose as well as the image background color specified by
>   -background.
> * The TXT coder now supports multiple image frames.
> * For image normalization (-normalize), add support for
>   histogram-threshold setting to specify the percentage of the
>   histogram to discard when computing image normalization parameters
>   (default is 0.1%). For example -set histogram-threshold 0.01
>   -normalize.
> * Added an INFO coder which produces textual image description
>   output similar to identify but may be used with convert like "gm
>   convert myfile info:-".
> * Support application of the PDF crop box via '-define
>   pdf:use-cropbox=true'.
> * For PCL printer output, define pcl:fit-to-page in order for the
>   printer to scale the image to fit the page.
> * Added order dither 5x5, 6x6, and 7x7 circular dither patterns to
>   create a halftone effect.
> * PNM subformats are now reported as the specific subformat rather
>   than just "PNM".
> * NetPBM's PAM format is now supported.
> * MacPaint image format reader is added.
> * Added TIFF LZMA compressor support.
> * Added TIFF support for a tiff:group-three-options define to allow
>   power-users to set the value of the GROUP3OPTIONS tag.
> * New core C API function SetImageColorRegion() to set the constant
>   pixel color for a specified region of the image.
> * New Wand C API function MagickWriteImagesFile() to append images
>   to a provided file handle.
> * New Wand C API function MagickSetImageSavedType() to allow
>   specifying the storage type used when saving the file (rather than
>   changing the current image characteristics).
> * In Wand C API, the functions NewPixelWand(), NewDrawingWand(), and
>   NewMagickWand() invoke InitializeMagick() automatically in case
>   user forgets to do so.
> * New Wand C API function MagickSetFormat() to allow setting the
>   file or blob format before it has been read.
> * New Wand C API function MagickSetDepth() to set the depth used
>   when reading from an image format which requires that the depth be
>   specified in advance.

Feature improvements:

> * Now compiles properly with libpng 1.4.X and 1.5.X.
> * Lcms 2.X is supported.

Performance Improvements:

> * TGA read performance improved.
> * PNM read/write performance improved.
> * Convolution (-convolve, -sharpen, -guassian, etc.) is faster.
> * Adaptive threshold image (-lat) is faster.
> * Image trimming (-trim) is faster.

Behavior Changes:

> * For DPX format and packed 10 bits, datums are now represented in
>   the same (reversed) order for all RGB and YCbCr formats.
>   Previously YCbCr 4:4:4 formats were not swapping the word datums
>   because the only real-world files encountered did not swap the
>   word datums.
> * The -colors, -map, and -monochrome options now take effect
>   immediately rather than at the end of all other processing.
> * Removed non-standard multi-frame extension for SGI format.
> * Windows install footprint is more consistent between DLL and
>   static builds.
> * LZMA compressed tarball is in 'xz' format rather than deprecated
>   'lzma' format.

# [1.3.12 (March 8, 2010)](#id37)

Security Fixes:

> * Updated libpng Windows sources to 1.2.43 in order to resolve
>   CVE-2010-0205 as it pertains to the GraphicsMagick Windows build.

Bug fixes:

> * Filter mode (write to stdout) was completely broken.
> * Should now compile with libpng 1.4.
> * Windows PerlMagick build identified itself as the wrong version.

New Features:

Behavior Changes:

> * DCX output format is only written on request. Previously the PCX
>   coder would automatically switch to DCX format if multiple frames

# [1.3.11 (February 21, 2010)](#id38)

Security Fixes:

> * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char which could

Bug fixes:

> * Fixed array underflow on systems using signed char which could
>   result in a program crash due to extended characters in filenames
>   or in certain file formats.

New Features:

> * Added a -thumbnail command to 'convert' and 'mogrify'. This is a
>   faster way to scale down the image when speed is a primary
>   concern.
> * Added a -extent command to 'convert' and 'mogrify' which
>   composites the image on top of a backing canvas image of solid
>   color.
> * Added support for -compose to the 'convert' and 'mogrify', which
>   were documented to support it (but did not).

Feature improvements:

> * None

Performance Improvements:

> * Requests for 'Over' and 'Atop' composition are converted to a

>   opaque.

Behavior Changes:

> * None

# [1.3.10 (February 10, 2010)](#id39)

Security Fixes:

> * None

Bug fixes:

> * +adjoin was not working correctly for the case when only one image
>   frame is present. With +adjoin and writing one frame to
>   "foo%d.jpg" it was outputting "foo%d.jpg" rather than "foo0.jpg".
> * When drawing paths, memory allocation for the points was much
>   larger than it needed to be (patch by Vladimir Lukianov).

New Features:

> * None

Feature improvements:

Performance Improvements:

> * None

Behavior Changes:

> * To reiterate the change which first appeared in 1.3.9, there is no
>   longer an implicit +adjoin if the output file name happens to

# [1.3.9 (February 4, 2010)](#id40)

Security Fixes:

> * None

Bug fixes:

> * Fix "double free" error when using gm import -frame.
> * XPM does not support RGBA color syntax, so return RGB instead.
> * The display '-update' option was only working in conjunction with
>   the '-delay' option with a delay setting of 2 or greater.
> * For formats which support multiple frames, output with +adjoin to
>   filenames containing a scene specification (e.g. foo%02d.tiff) was
>   resulting in wrong output file names.
> * -convolve was crashing rather than reporting an error.
> * Fixed crash if the number of OpenMP threads was reduced from the
>   original value via '-limit threads' or omp\_set\_num\_threads().
> * -blur was not blurring the opacity channel for solid-color images.
> * When installing HTML documentation, many files were included which
>   are not part of the formatted documentation.
> * Several deleted global string constants are restored with
>   deprecated status in order to assure that symbols are not removed
>   from the ABI.

New Features:

# [1.3.8 (January 21, 2010)](#id41)

Security Fixes:

> * Fix for CVE-2009-1882 "Integer overflow in the XMakeImage
>   function".
> * Fix lockup due to hanging in loop while parsing malformed
>   sub-image specification (SourceForge issue 2886560).
> * Libltdl: Updated libtool to 2.2.6b in order to fix security issue.
>   Resolves CVE-2009-3736 as it pertains to GraphicsMagick.

Bug fixes:

> * -convolve, -recolor: Validate that user-provided matrix is square
>   when parsing -convolve and -recolor commands in order to avoid a
>   core dump.
> * CALS: Reading images taller than the image width resulted in a
>   failure.
> * ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
>   transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity. Behavior was
>   inconsistent. In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
>   cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
>   getting enabled in the image as it should.
> * DCRAW: Module name was not registered so modules based builds were
>   not supporting formats provided via 'dcraw'.
> * GetOptimalKernelWidth1D(), GetOptimalKernelWidth2D(): In the Q32
>   build, convolution kernel size was estimated incorrectly for large
>   sigmas on 32-bit systems due to arithmetic overflow. This could
>   cause wrong results for -convolve, -blur, -sharpen, and other
>   algorithms which use these functions.
> * Image Size: Fixed the ability to pass the image size via the
>   filename specification like "myfile.jpg[640x480]" rather than
>   needing to use -size.
> * IPTC: Blob data needed to be padded to an even size. Size is now
>   correctly reported.
> * IPTC: Returned IPTC string values were one character too short.
> * Large Files: Large pixel cache files were not working under GNU
>   Linux.
> * JP2: Fixed some value scaling problems.
> * JP2: Fix possible crash at exit when Jasper is used by a modules
>   build.
> * MPC: is\_monochrome and is\_grayscale flags were not managed
>   properly for the MPC coder.
> * PCL: Page was not always being ejected.
> * PNG: The png8 encoder would fail when trying to write a 1-color
>   image.
> * PSD: PSD parser was confused by 0x0 pixel layers, resulting in
>   image data corruption of all following layers.
> * -rotate, -shear: Some internally-reported errors were potentially
>   being lost.
> * Subrange/stdin: Commands now support reading an image from stdin
>   in conjunction with a subrange specification (e.g. "-[1]").
> * Magick++ STL ShadeImage: Implementation was completely botched.

New Features:

> * CALS Type 1 files may now be written (Work contributed by John
>   Sergeant). CALS support is dependent on the TIFF library.
> * GROUP4RAW encoder supports reading/writing RAW Group4 data.
> * JP2: JPEG 2000 may now be written in arbitrary bit depths ranging
>   from 2 to 16 rather than just 8 or 16.
> * JPEG: IJG JPEG library version 7 is now supported.
> * JPEG: Added jpeg:block-smoothing and jpeg:fancy-upsampling defines
>   to control these JPEG library options.
> * JPEG: Detect and apply colorspaces appropriately for ITU FAX JPEG.
> * Resource Limits: There is now a "threads" resource limit which
>   allows specifying the number of OpenMP threads which may be used,
>   similar to the OMP\_NUM\_THREADS environment variable.
> * TIFF: Allow CIELAB TIFF to be read.
> * MagickGetImageAttribute()/MagickSetImageAttribute(): New Wand
>   methods to support getting and setting an image attribute.
>   Contributed by Mikko Koppanen.
> * ClonePixelWand(): New Wand method to deep-copy an existing pixel
>   wand.
> * ClonePixelWands(): New Wand method to deep-copy an array of
>   existing pixel wands.
> * MagickCdlImage(): New Wand method to apply the ASC CDL to an
>   image.
> * MagickGetImageBoundingBox(): New Wand method to return the crop
>   bounding box required to remove any solid-color border from the
>   image.
> * MagickGetImageFuzz(), MagickSetImageFuzz(): New Wand methods to
>   get and set the color comparison fuzz factor.
> * MagickHaldClutImage(): New Wand method to apply a Hald CLUT to an
>   image.
> * MagickSetResolution(): New Wand method to set the wand resolution.
> * MagickSetResolutionUnits(): New Wand method to set the wand
>   resolution units.
> * Magick++: Allow Magick++ library to built as a DLL under MinGW and
>   Cygwin. This requires a modern GCC in order for C++ exceptions to
>   work.

Feature improvements:

> * Cygwin: Cygwin 1.7 is now supported.
> * JPEG compression settings are preserved (if possible) when
>   inserting JPEG blobs into formats which use JPEG.
> * PDF: If the original file used JPEG compression, then use JPEG
>   compression with original settings (if possible).
> * TIFF: Update Windows build to use libtiff 3.9.2.
> * X11 Display: Apply a checkerboard pattern underneath transparent
>   images which use more than simple binary transparency.

Performance Improvements:

> * Gamma: Performance is improved for Q8 and Q16 builds. Also
>   preserve full precision in Q32 build.
> * String data is dealt with a bit more efficiently (fewer
>   allocations, less memory, and less CPU).

Behavior Changes:

> * InitializeMagick() MUST be invoked prior to using any Magick API
>   function. Failure to do so will likely lead to an immediate
>   application crash. This is due to initialization and runtime
>   changes intended to improve thread safety and efficiency.
>   Previously it was only strongly recommended to invoke
>   InitializeMagick().
> * ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
>   transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity. Behavior was
>   inconsistent. In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
>   cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
>   getting enabled in the image as it should.
> * colors.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional. Previous
>   content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
>   existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
>   entries to color.mgk.
> * DisableSlowOpenMP is now the default. Use --enable-openmp-slow to
>   enable OpenMP for algorithms which sometimes run slower rather
>   than faster.
> * magic.mgk: This configuration file is no longer used since this
>   data is now compiled into the library in an efficient way.
> * modules.mgk: Is now empty to default and is optional. Previous
>   content is now compiled into the library in an efficient way, but
>   existing values may be modified, or new values added by adding
>   entries to modules.mgk.
> * Third party executables not included in the Visual Studio build
>   are no longer bundled in the GraphicsMagick installer. This means
>   that hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and mpeg2enc.exe are no longer
>   distributed.

# [1.3.7 (September 17, 2009)](#id42)

Security Fixes:

> * PCX: Detect improper rows, columns, or depth. Fixes CVE-2008-1097
>   "Memory corruption in ImageMagick's PCX coder".
> * DrawDashPolygon: Avoid a crash which sometimes occured with tiny
>   polygons.

Bug fixes:

> * JPEG: Profile chunks need to be concatenated in order to build
>   the whole profile. This was not working so embedded profiles
>   larger than 32K or maybe 64K were being corrupted. This bug was
>   introduced in GraphicsMagick 1.2.
> * Meta: Fix memory leaks.
> * Meta: Work better with with IPTC record 2 blocks and deal better
>   with IPTC embedded in an 8BIM profile. Fixes by John Sergeant.
> * MPC: Fix crash when reading MPC and the input image is modified.
> * PNG: Ensure that the opacity channel is properly initialized.
> * -profile: Lowercase arguments were sometimes not working as
>   expected.
> * Topol: Topol reader actually works now and is included in test
>   suite.
> * TIFF: Read and write JPEG-compressed grayscale TIFF correctly.
> * VisualMagick configure now works properly when output paths are
>   specified.
> * WMF: Eliminate memory leaks.

New Features:

> * MagickWand: New method MagickSetCompressionQuality() to allow
>   setting the compression quality.
> * MagickWand: New method CloneDrawingWand() to deep-copy a drawing
>   wand.
> * MagickWand: New method DrawGetException() to retrieve information

> * MagickWand: New method DrawClearException() to clear a drawing wand
>   exception.
> * Magick++: New Image method cdl() to apply the ASC CDL.
> * Magick++: New Image method colorMatrix() to apply a color matrix
>   to the image channels.
> * Magick++: New Image method haldClut() to apply a color lookup
>   table (Hald CLUT) to the image.
> * MSL/Conjure: Added a new 'profile' command which applies, adds, or
>   removes one or more IPTC, ICC or generic profiles from a file.
>   Work contributed by John Sergeant.
> * Added a 'time' subcommand to provide Unix-style 'time' output when
>   a 'time' capability is missing, or the reporting format is
>   inconsistent. For example 'gm time convert ...'.

Feature improvements:

> * ColorMatrixImage(): Add opaque opacity channel when needed.
> * PDF & PS: Use '-type palette' prior to input file name to cause
>   Ghostscript to return a dithered colormapped image.
> * PNG: Now compiles with libpng-1.4.0beta74 and later.
> * TIFF: Libtiff in Windows build is upgraded to 3.9.1. This allows
>   GraphicsMagick to read and write 16 and 24 bit float TIFF files.
> * Windows code to find Ghostscript is rewritten from scratch.

Performance Improvements:

> * Drawing of points, lines, and polygons (and complex shapes based
>   on these) is now accelerated using OpenMP with excellent speed-up.
> * ICC color transforms now see linear speedup from OpenMP.
> * Rotate: For rotations of 90 or 270 degrees, tile sizes are
>   selected more appropriately.

Behavior Changes:

> * No longer clear the exception structure at the start of
>   ReadImage() and other similar functions since this sometimes masks
>   errors. The API user is expected to make sure that the exception
>   structure is clean prior to invoking a function.
> * SVG: Writer is now disabled since it usually does not work properly.

# [1.3.6 (July 25, 2009)](#id43)

>   files.
> * OpenMP: Fix (benign) multi-thread cross-contentions (detected by
>   valgrind's Helgrind).
> * TIFF: Fix problem with reading one bit per sample RGB images.
> * TIFF: Writer was using rows-per-strip of 8 when writing
>   JPEG-compressed TIFF. This does not work for vertical
>   subsampling, and some TIFF readers insist on 16. The
>   rows-per-strip is now required to be a multiple of 16.
> * TIFF: In some cases, the TIFF reader and writer were accessing
>   planar TIFF in row-order rather than plane-order, which resulted
>   in sever buffering problems in libtiff, and failure when
>   compression was used.
> * -write now works usefully as documented.
> * Temporary file name generator was not random enough, resulting in
>   some file name collisions for GraphicsMagick processes started at
>   the same time.
> * PerlMagick: Fixed Ping on a BLOB.
> * GetImageDepth was leaking memory.
> * Convert/mogrify -mask option was leaking memory.
> * Mogrify -output-directory option was leaking memory.
> * DPX: Fixed memory leak encountered when subsampling to 4:2:2.
> * DPX: Values read received insuficient scaling, which round-tripped
>   correctly, but rounded-down excessively if any image processing
>   was applied.

> * Added HRS reader for slow scan TV (contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).
> * Pthreads (POSIX threads) API may now be used under the WIN32 API.
> * New access confirmation facility (MagickConfirmAccess) to allow
>   the API user to monitor and/or block access to files and URLs.
>   This allows the API user to implement a security policy based on
>   actual accesses.
> * New color matrix function (ColorMatrixImage) to apply a color
>   matrix similar to Adobe Flash Flash.filters.colorMatrixFilter(),
>   and Windows GDI+ ColorMatrix class, (order up to 5x5) to the image
>   pixels. This is accessible via the -recolor command option.
> * Added an IDENTITY coder to return a Hald identity CLUT image of
>   specified order (e.g. "identity:8").
> * Added a Hald CLUT capability as described at
>   <http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html>. This allows a
>   color transformation to be easily created and replicated on any
>   number of images. The algorithm is accessed by the -hald-clut
>   option of 'convert' and 'mogrify'. Original algorithm by Eskil
>   Steenberg and adapted for GraphicsMagick by CleÌment Follet, with
>   additional work by Bob Friesenhahn.
> * Added support for the ASC CDL transform. Available as -asc-cdl
>   via the 'convert' and 'mogrify' subcommands. Original
>   implementation by ClÃ©ment Follet but considerably re-worked by Bob
>   Friesenhahn. Implementation passes the +/- 1 count accuracy
>   requirement required by the ASC CDL SOP tests.
> * Added support for reading CALS Type 1 format (contributed by John
>   Sergeant). CALS is a standard raster format used by the US
>   Department of Defense for storing blueprint images.
> * Added a random number generation system based on George
>   Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry generator. Somewhat slower than
>   rand() but produces better random numbers with a period >2^60.
>   This is a much better random number generator than the C library
>   rand() and the algorithm is integrated in a way which maximizes
>   multi-thread performance.
> * The 'compare' command now supports a -maximum-error option to
>   specify the maximum image error so that it may be used to support
>   boolean logic in automated test scripts.
> * For OpenMP-builds, the '-list resource' output now indicates the
>   number of threads which will be used.

Feature improvements:

> * Image resize now avoids adding "halos" around objects when
>   resizing an image which contains transparency (patch contributed by
>   Pavel Merdin).
> * DICOM: The DICOM reader is completely re-written and is much more
>   functional now. A few features (e.g. RLE compression) are still
>   missing. This work is contributed by John Sergeant.
> * EXIF: Unprintable characters in EXIF attribute strings are now
>   returned using three-digit octal notation. Unknown tags are
>   identified via their four-character hex value.
> * PCL: PCL writer is rewritten to fix many bugs, add support for
>   compression, add support for 8 bit PseudoClass images, and
>   dramatically improve usability (work contributed by John Sergeant).
> * TIFF: Allow the user to force the returned image to be TrueColor
>   type for min-is-white and min-is-black TIFF files.
> * TIFF: User can now specify the predictor using syntax like
>   '-define tiff:predictor=2'.
> * TIFF: User can now specify the rows-per-strip value when using
>   JPEG compression.
> * TXT: The TXT reader is now capable of reading image files written
>   by the TXT writer, as well continuing to render ASCII text into an
>   image (work contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).
> * Utilities @file.txt syntax for including a list of files to use as
>   an argument now really works as expected. This may be used to
>   inject any other text into the command line as well. As a result,
>   the 'mogrify' utility may be invoked on thousands of files at once
>   while obtaining the list of files to process from a text file.
> * The 'mogrify' utility now caches argument images so that they are
>   loaded only once when mogrify is used to process multiple image
>   files.

Performance Improvements:

> * -median and -noise now see reliable linear speedup as threads are
>   added.

Behavior Changes:

> * PerlMagick is configured but no longer built by default.
> * Use '-interlace Line' to produce an interlaced GIF, PNG, or
>   progressive JPEG.

>   the specified directory.
> * Use the -create-directories option in conjunction with
>   -output-directory and 'mogrify' to create any necessary subdirectories.
> * A Pixels resource limit is added. Use '-limit Pixels value' to limit
>   the maximum number of pixels in an image to 'value'.
> * The already supported option '-type Optimize' is now honored by
>   formats that need to choose a subformat based on the properties of
>   the image. Grueling tests of many/all pixels are not performed
>   unless '-type Optimize' is supplied.

> * Replaced existing DPX "support" with all-new DPX support conforming
>   to the SMPTE 268M-2003 standard.
> * Cineon reader completely rewritten.
> * TIFF coder is completely re-written. Now supports reading and
>   writing RGB, CMYK, and grayscale, scanline-oriented TIFF images
>   with arbitrary (1 to 32 bits) depth. Includes support for tiled
>   TIFF, floating point TIFF, LogLuv TIFF, BigTIFF, arbitrary depths,
>   and associated alpha.
> * TIFF coder now supports retrieving and saving XMP profiles.
> * MATLAB support is much improved and supports writing as well.
> * WPG reader now supports CTM translations.
> * ART format now supports writing.
> * Support 32-bit raw RGB images.
> * Support 32-bit raw CMYK images.

>   ICC ICM color profile if present.

API enhancements:

> * Added ExportImageChannel() and ImportImageChannel() APIs to support
>   exporting and importing pixel regions with an arbitary range of (1
>   to 32) bits per quantum.
> * Added image leveling methods for Magick++.
> * Generalized GetImageAttribute() support for retrieving wildcarded
>   attributes so that an identify -format specification like
>   "%[dpx:\*]" works as expected.
> * Incorporated changes changes necessary so that GraphicsMagick can
>   work with the Ch C/C++ interpreter from SoftIntegration at
>   <http://www.softintegration.com/>.
> * Added MagickAllocFunctions() to allow the API user to replace the
>   underlying memory allocator functions.
> * Added MagickMalloc() and deprecated AcquireMemory().

> * Added MagickFree() and deprecated LiberateMemory().

Performance improvments:

> * The DispatchImage() and ConstituteImage() functions incorporate
>   special case code for BGR, BGRO, BGRP, RGB, RGBO, and I formats (8
>   bit only) in order to improve performance dramatically.
> * When writing very large JPEG images, don't enable Huffman compression
>   since doing so requires libjpeg to buffer the entire image in memory.
> * When using the 'identify' -verbose option, -verbose must be specified
>   twice in order to obtain the color count. This makes normal use of
>   -verbose much faster.
> * Significantly improved read/write speed for bilevel and gray images.
> * TIFF I/O is considerably faster.
> * Postscript writer is 10-15X faster.
> * PNM formats writer is 10-100X faster.
> * Rotate by 90 or 270 degrees is 2-9X faster.

Windows-specific improvements/changes:

> * For the MinGW and Cygwin builds, the Magick++ library is forced to
>   build as a static library since otherwise C++ exceptions don't work.
> * MinGW cross-build is available from a Linux or FreeBSD host.
> * Determine location of Ghostscript fonts only once in order to improve
>   performance.
> * Updated bzip2 to 1.0.4.

# [1.1 (Released April 4, 2004)](#id51)

Bug fixes:

> * Semaphore fix which is necessary for proper multi-threaded operation.
> * Configure script fix to ensure that -lfpx is not supplied to the C
>   compiler during subsequent tests since this fails on some systems.
> * Fix for East and West gravity computations.
> * System error reports (errno) associated with an exception are now
>   correctly obtained from the context existing when the exception was
>   thrown rather than the context of the reporting function.
> * JNG encoder fix. Files were being written with incorrect
>   alpha\_sample\_value in the header. These can be repaired by reading
>   them into GM 1.1 and rewriting them.
> * XPM fix to module registration.
> * PSD fix for index calculation when QuantumDepth>8.
> * Validate that geometry specifications only include allowed
>   characters.
> * SGI fix to save compression type while writing.
> * EXIF attributes were not being retrieved when requested.
> * Fix for bug when reading an image via a user-provided file
>   descriptor.
> * The reported image magick string is now always that of the original
>   input file (it was sometimes being reported as the format produced by
>   an intermediate delegate program).
> * Fixes to color profiling of CMYK images.
> * Memory leak fixed in DrawClipPath().
> * Arc drawing is fixed.
> * Command-line parsing bug under Linux due to Linux's sscanfs
>   inability to parse strings like "0x1" as "%fx%f" is fixed.
> * Scaling of 5 and 6-bit colors was slightly incorrect in BMP, AVI,
>   DIB, and TIM datastreams.
> * GM utility now reports an error rather than silently returning if
>   an unsupported sub-command is provided.
> * TIFF coder was writing 16-bit per sample RGB images incorrectly on
>   little-endian CPUs.

Performance improvements:

> * Texture tiling is now 7X faster.
> * Color profile processing speed improvements for colormapped images.

Utilities enhancements:

> * For Unix, 'gm version' now includes a dump of the configure and
>   build parameters.
> * Logging of thrown exceptions is now supported. Use '-debug
>   exception'. This is useful to learn when and where errors are
>   reported.
> * The -define option is added in order to support supplying
>   additional options to coders without needing to add additional
>   command line options or structure members.
> * The output of 'gm identify -verbose' now provides a nice dump
>   of EXIF data.
> * The -sampling-factor option now accepts as many HxV pairs as
>   there are JPEG components. Omitted ones default to 1x1.
> * The convert and montage commands now support an -operator command to

Coder additions/improvements

> * The META coder supports wide characters for the IPTC and 8BIM
>   formats.
> * The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.
> * An "IMAGE" coder is provided which provides access to a large
>   number of images (derived from XFig) suitable for use as patterns,
>   or as test images.
> * The "PATTERN" coder now returns an image pattern tiled to size
>   (equivalent results to TILE:IMAGE:pattern). This is for ImageMagick
>   compatibility.
> * The CINEON coder now supports reading and writing images in CINEON
>   "CIN" linear gray and RGB formats. The read support is still very
>   weak, but it works for common images.
> * The JPEG coder now estimates the original JPEG quality and sampling
>   factors and will reuse these options when writing JPEG if the image
>   is of the same type and the option "-define JPEG:preserve-settings"
>   is supplied.
> * The JPEG-2000 coder now supports all Jasper library arguments using
>   command line syntax similar to '-define jp2:rate=0.5'.
> * Reading and writting compressed SVG (SVGZ) is now supported.
> * The TXT coder now observes depth when writing.
> * The TIFF coder now outputs colormapped images with 1, 2, 4, and 8
>   bits per sample in order to provide much smaller file sizes for
>   images with very few colors.
> * Many TIFF coder enhancements. Now reads colormapped and grayscale
>   images at arbitrary (even odd) bits-per-sample sizes. Now properly
>   supports an opacity channel (at any bits-per-sample value) for
>   grayscale images. Bilevel grayscale images are treated similar to any
>   other grayscale image unless CCITT FAX3/FAX4 compression is
>   requested. Now allows the user to specify an arbitrary
>   bits-per-sample value for grayscale images (even odd values) using
>   "-define tiff:bits-per-sample=value". Now automatically stores the
>   image as TrueColor RGB pixels if the image compression is set to JPEG.
>   TIFF files are now written in using the TIFF library's default endian
>   order rather than always big endian.
> * The WPG coder now renders embedded WMFs.
> * The PS3 coder is completely re-written to work much better and
>   support more features (see ChangeLog).

Code structure enhancements:

> * Error handling has been improved and validated through testing.
>   Some errors were being lost, unnecessarily ignored, or reported as
>   something else entirely.
> * The number of error text messages to be maintained has been reduced
>   by consolidating similar messages.
> * The memory allocator functions have been replaced with similar
>   macros in order to eliminate warnings with GCC 3.3, avoid
>   accidentally casting away const, and allow memory debuggers to
>   report memory allocations and frees against the correct functions.
>   The previously-used functions remain in the library for the purpose
>   of compatibility.
> * <magick/xwindow.h> no longer depends on magick\_config.h defines.
> * The text string localization code has been replaced with a simpler
>   version written by Bill Radcliffe.
> * Added key,value "map" APIs (somewhat similar to C++'s <map>) for
>   internal use.

API enhancements:

> * Incorporated John Cristy's Wand API's in a new GraphicsMagickWand
>   library.
> * API definition is no longer dependent on types which vary in size
>   (e.g. size\_t) depending on large file compilation options. This means
>   that applications may now be compiled without any special large file
>   options and still work properly with the library.
> * Thrown exceptions (ExceptionInfo structure) now include source
>   file, source line, function name, and current system error number.
> * The GetMagickInfoArray() function is added to replace use of
>   GetMagickInfo() for code which needs to access the coder list. This
>   is necessary since invoking GetMagickInfo() may re-order the coder
>   list, causing problems for code which traverses the list. Using
>   GetMagickInfo() to access individual list elements is safe.
> * Added the CopyException function to support copying exception info
>   from one structure to another.
> * Added the ReplaceImageInList function to replace an image in an
>   image list.
> * Added the DrawPeekGraphicContext function to access the current
>   DrawInfo structure in the drawing context stack. Use of this
>   function is not recommended since it voilates proper programming
>   practices. It is added to support the Wand API's.
> * GetImageDepth() now returns an integral value between 1 and
>   QuantumDepth and is no longer limited to the values 8, 16, and 32.
> * SetImageDepth() supports setting the image modulus depth to any
>   integral value between 1 and QuantumDepth. This effects the effective
>   numeric precision, not the storage depth, since the quantum storage
>   type is still a Quantum.
> * GetImageChannelDepth() supports retrieving the modulus depth for a
>   specified channel.
> * SetImageChannelDepth() supports setting the modulus depth for a
>   specified channel.
> * ProfileImage is updated to handle alpha channels and grayscale
>   images.
> * Added GetImageProfile() to retrieve a CMS profile from an image.
> * Added SetImageProfile() to attach a CMS profile to an image without
>   adjusting the image pixels.
> * Added DeleteImageProfile() to remove a CMS profile from an image.
> * ConstituteImage() and DispatchImage() now support 'T' (transparency),
>   'O' (opacity), and 'P' (pad) options.
> * CompositeImage() now supports CopyCyanCompositeOp,
>   CopyMagentaCompositeOp, CopyYellowCompositeOp, and
>   CopyBlackCompositeOp, composition operators.
> * GetColorHistogram() obtains a color histogram for the image.
> * QuantumOperatorImage() and QuantumOperatorRegionImage() support

PerlMagick fixes:

> * Configure/build fixes for IBM's AIX operating system.

Windows-specific improvements:

> * The static install package now uses the "uninstalled"
>   configuration so that it does not depend on the Windows registry in

On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.

The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:

> * Use an open development model.
> * Encourage new developers to join the project.
> * Avoid unnecessary source code "churn".
> * Establish and preserve a stable API.
> * Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.
> * Improve memory efficiency.
> * Use a release process which assures a working product.
> * Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.

These issues are now resolved in the GraphicsMagick Mercurial
repository.

It is worth noting that ImageMagick's built-in SVG renderer has the
same problem with "circular.svg" (specify the input file name like
"msvg:circular.svg").
