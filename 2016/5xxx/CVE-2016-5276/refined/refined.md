Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-5276:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free that occurs in the `mozilla::a11y::DocAccessible::ProcessInvalidationList` function. This is triggered when setting an `aria-owns` attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning that memory that has been deallocated is accessed again. This can lead to unpredictable program behavior or crashes, and, in some cases, exploitable code execution.
*   **Accessibility API Flaw:** The vulnerability lies within the accessibility API implementation, specifically how it handles `aria-owns` attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact, if successfully exploited, could be arbitrary code execution due to the use-after-free condition causing memory corruption. This allows the attacker to potentially gain control of the affected system.
*   **Crash:** The vulnerability can also cause a crash which leads to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Content:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating web content using the `aria-owns` attribute. This suggests a network-based attack vector where malicious content on a website could exploit the vulnerability if a user browses it with a vulnerable version of the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to serve malicious web content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or inject code on a webpage that a user visits with the vulnerable browser. 
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability's trigger:** The attacker requires knowledge of how to exploit the use-after-free vulnerability using `aria-owns`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by "Nils".
*   The fix involved a change in how `mozilla::a11y::DocAccessible` manages the invalidation list and ensures that DOM nodes are kept alive as long as they are still potentially needed for accessibility purposes by holding onto addref'ed pointers rather than raw pointers.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Firefox and Thunderbird versions and it was fixed in Firefox 49 and Firefox ESR 45.4.
*   This vulnerability existed for a long time but was exposed by a separate bugfix relating to DOM changes.

This information is derived from the multiple sources provided, all of which describe different aspects of the same vulnerability. The key point to note is that this is a use-after-free vulnerability that could potentially allow arbitrary code execution when browsing malicious webpages with a vulnerable version of Firefox or Thunderbird.
