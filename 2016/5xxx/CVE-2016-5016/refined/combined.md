## Routing

Routing release bumped to 0.136.0 - [Release Notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release/releases/tag/0.136.0)

* Authors of components that use `route-registrar` can now provide a `route_service_url` so that requests to the route are proxied to the route service [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112610113)
* `route-registrar` process is no longer run as root [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126094567)
* `route-registrar` source has been moved to routing-release and is symlinked in cf-release [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126431053), [more details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119775837)

## Loggregator

* [BOSH HM Forwarder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/tree/develop/src/boshhmforwarder) donated to Loggregator OSS. Forward BOSH health metrics to firehose.
* `noaa` library reliability improvements, including support for auto-refresh of the access token.
* [Expose Metron URL Through Bosh 2.0 Links](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121080431)
* Removed AZ property from Traffic Controller - never used

## Internal Components

#### `postgres-release` (includes `postgres` job)

* Extracted this release out of cf-release into its own separate release (with no functional changes). [[repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release)][[bosh.io](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release?all=1)][[details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126059053)]

#### `etcd-release` (includes `etcd` and `etcd_metrics_server` jobs)

* Bumped from v58 to [v63](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v63). Functional changes:
  + Bumped version of Golang used by this release from 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126820683)

#### `consul-release` (includes `consul_agent` job)

* Bumped from v92 to [v101](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/releases/tag/v101). Functional changes:
  + Fix `consul_agent` job when running on BOSH VMs with multiple dynamic networks. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126793339)
  + Bumped version of Golang used by this release from 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126820729)
  + BOSH manifest configuration for consul\_agent job only requires certificates and keys necessary for the configured mode of operation, i.e. in "server" mode, client certificate and signing key does not need to be configured, and in "client" mode, server certificate and key does not need to be configured. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126422977)
  + The `consul_agent` job in server mode is now resilient to job name changes, to support transitioning from a "BOSH 1.0"-style deployment to a "BOSH 2.0"-style deployment that is likely to collapse multiple jobs across AZs into a single instance group using the [`migrated_from`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-notes/blob/master/finished/availability-zones.md#migrating-data-when-collapsing-deployment-jobs) and [`azs`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-notes/blob/master/finished/availability-zones.md) features. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show125945487)

#### `nats-release` (includes `nats` and `nats_stream_forwarder` jobs)

* Bumped from [219e93bd](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nats-release/commits/219e93bd) to [6c1a563b](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nats-release/commits/6c1a563b). Functional changes:
  + Bumped version of Golang used by this release from 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126820849)

## Job Spec Changes

* Added `cc.run_prestart_migrations` (default `true`) that can be disabled on deployments where the CCDB is collocated with the Cloud Controller and is unavailable during pre-start.

## Recommended BOSH Stemcell Versions

* real IaaS: 3262.4
* BOSH-Lite: 3262.2

Note: For AWS you should use the [Xen-HVM](http://bosh.io/stemcells/bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent) stemcells rather than Xen.

These are soft recommendations; several different versions of the stemcells are likely to work fine with this version of cf-release and the corresponding versions of the additional releases listed below.

## Recommended Versions of Additional Releases

These versions are soft recommendations, as several different versions of these releases may work correctly with this version of cf-release.
