Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the Ethernet dissector within Wireshark. The dissector did not properly handle certain malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of malformed Ethernet packets in the dissector logic.
- The dissector crashed when parsing packets in specific cases.
- The issue stems from a missing requirement for the `WTAP_ENCAP_ETHERNET` dissector to receive a `struct eth_phdr`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a crash of the Wireshark application.
- This could lead to denial of service if an attacker can repeatedly send the malformed packets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto a network that Wireshark is capturing.
- It can also be triggered by opening a malformed packet trace file in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark, or provide a crafted capture file.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the crash, it can be done by any user who can capture or open pcap files using affected versions of Wireshark.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.3 and fixed in version 2.0.4.
- The fix involves ensuring that a `struct eth_phdr` is passed to the `WTAP_ENCAP_ETHERNET` dissector. This was implemented through changes in `packet-pktap.c`, `packet-ppi.c`, and `packet-rpcap.c` files.
- The vulnerability is identified as "Ethernet dissector crash".
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable in the context of a user opening a malicious packet capture file or by network injection.
