Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The Intel Crosswalk Project, a library for cross-platform mobile development, did not properly handle SSL errors. Specifically, it failed to re-validate SSL certificates after a user initially accepted an invalid or self-signed certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The core issue was the lack of proper and repeated validation of SSL certificates. After a user granted permission to an invalid certificate, the application would accept all future invalid certificates without any further checks.
*   **User Interface Failure:** The prompt presented to the user when an invalid SSL certificate was encountered did not clearly indicate that accepting it would grant permanent permission, nor did it warn the user that future invalid certificates would be accepted. This is a failure to warn the user of unsafe actions. (CWE-356)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** A network-level attacker could use a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate to intercept and potentially capture sensitive data transmitted by an application using the vulnerable Crosswalk library. This is enabled because the application would not re-validate the certificate after the user's initial acceptance of an invalid one.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data transmitted over the network by applications built on the vulnerable Crosswalk library could be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-level Attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network-level attacks, particularly MITM attacks.
*   **Invalid SSL Certificates:** The attacker would need to present a self-signed or otherwise invalid SSL certificate to the victim's device.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to initially accept the invalid certificate prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Control:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable application and the server it is communicating with. This could be achieved by controlling the network the device is connected to, such as a compromised Wi-Fi hotspot.
*   **Self-Signed Certificate:** The attacker needs to have a way to generate and present an invalid SSL certificate.
*  **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the victim user to click "OK" on the initial error dialog.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was fixed in Crosswalk stable version 19.49.514.5 and later beta/canary versions, which address the vulnerability by generating a non-user visible programmatic error when encountering invalid SSL certificates, forcing the application to handle them appropriately.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Yakov Shafranovich of Nightwatch Cybersecurity.
