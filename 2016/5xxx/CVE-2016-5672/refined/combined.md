# Advisory: Intel Crosswalk SSL Prompt Issue [CVE 2016-5672]

# Summary

The **Intel Crosswalk Project** library for cross-platform mobile development did not properly handle SSL errors. This behaviour could subject applications developed using this library to SSL MITM attacks.

# Vulnerability Details

**[The Crosswalk Project](https://crosswalk-project.org/),** created by **[Intel’s Open Source Technology Center](https://01.org/)**, allows mobile developers to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop and deploy mobile apps across multiple platforms from the same codebase. The library packages the HTML assets provided by the developer and runs them inside a WebView on the device. The library also bridges some of the common APIs and services from the Javascript code in the WebView to the underlying platform. The project supports deployment to iOS, Windows Phone and Android. It is implemented in multiple apps, some of which [can be found here](https://crosswalk-project.org/documentation/community/apps/app-list.php).

For the Android implementation of CrossWalk – when an invalid or self-signed SSL certificate is used during communication with the server, the underlying library displays a prompt to the user asking them to grant permission or deny permission to this certificate. If the user allows the certificate, that choice is remembered going forward and from that point in, all subsequent requests with invalid SSL certificates are accepted by the application, and are not rechecked. This applies even to connections over different WiFi hotspots and different certificates. This may allow a network-level attacker to mount MITM attack using invalid SSL certificate and capture sensitive data.

Example of error dialog

The fix changes the behaviour to generate a programmatic error message not visible to the user  about an invalid SSL certificate. This issue has been fixed in the following versions of Crosswalk and all users of the library are encouraged to upgrade:

* 19.49.514.5 (stable)
* 20.50.533.11 (beta)
* 21.51.546.0 (beta)
* 22.51.549.0 (canary)

This issue was originally discovered while testing a third-party Android app using this library.

## Intel CrossWalk project does not validate SSL certificates after first acceptance

#### Vulnerability Note VU#217871

Original Release Date: 2016-07-29 | Last Revised: 2016-07-29

---

### Overview

The Intel Crosswalk project is a framework for developing hybrid apps for Android and iOS. The Crosswalk project does not properly handle SSL certificate validation when a user accepts an invalid certificate, preventing the app for validating any future SSL certificates.

### Description

| [**CWE-356**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/356.html)**: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions** **-** CVE-2016-5672  When a user makes a network request, an app using the Crosswalk project shows an initial error message if an invalid SSL certificate is found. If the user selects "OK", the app then accepts all future SSL certificates without validation. The app does not make it clear that the dialog grants permanent permission to accept invalid certificates; the user is never prompted again.The researcher has released a [security advisory](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2016/07/29/advisory-intel-crosswalk-ssl-prompt-issue) with more information. Intel has also released a [blog post](https://blogs.intel.com/evangelists/2016/07/28/crosswalk-security-vulnerability/) about this issue. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A victim user that is enticed to accept an invalid SSL certificate actually accepted invalid SSL certificates indefinitely from any source, allowing possible man-in-the-middle attacks in the future from other sources. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The issue has been resolved in Crosswalk stable 19.49.514.5. Affected users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. Developers should ensure their apps are rebuilt using the latest Crosswalk update. |
