Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in the `__res_vinit` function within the glibc resolver library. Specifically, a `sockaddr_in6` structure allocated in `resolv/res_init.c` is not freed under certain conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The `sockaddr_in6` structure, which is 28 bytes in size, is allocated but not freed when using IPv6 nameservers. This leak occurs on a per-thread basis.
- **Incorrect Loop Condition:** The `__res_iclose` function was looping on the wrong variable `statp->_u._ext.nscount` instead of the correct variable `statp->nscount`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak can lead to a denial of service due to memory exhaustion if a program creates many threads that perform failing name lookups that do not require a network request. This is especially true if the hostname resolution can be satisfied by /etc/hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Name Resolution:** The vulnerability is triggered when name resolution functions are called, specifically when the resolver is initialized but not fully used.
- **Thread Creation:** The leak is per-thread, so a program that creates multiple threads and performs the specific type of name lookups will trigger the vulnerability.
- **Partial Resolver Initialization:** The issue arises when internal resolver data structures are only partially initialized and are then closed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code that performs DNS lookups within a process that creates multiple threads using the glibc resolver.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the parameters of these lookups such that they trigger the partial initialization condition, for example a hostname that can be found in /etc/hosts and thus doesn't need a network request to resolve.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is a regression introduced in glibc 2.22 due to commit `2212c1420c92a33b0e0bd9a34938c9814a56c0f7`.
- The memory leak is 28 bytes per thread according to valgrind.
- The issue only occurs when the hostname can be resolved from /etc/hosts.
- The fix involves correctly looping through defined nameservers using the `statp->nscount` variable, rather than the incorrect `statp->_u._ext.nscount`.
- The fix is included in glibc 2.24.
- The vulnerability was flagged as a security issue after observing the memory leak while running Apache httpd.
