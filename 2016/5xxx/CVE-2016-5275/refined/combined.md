The following testcase crashes the latest ASAN build of Firefox (BuildID=20160711143746) as follows:
<script>
function start() {
o0=document;
o13=(new DOMParser()).parseFromString('','text/html');
o14=o13.all[0];
o80=document.createElement('canvas');
o14.innerHTML='<svg style><filter><feConvolveMatrix>';
o133=o14.querySelectorAll('\*')[2];
o134=o14.querySelectorAll('\*')[3];
o254=o80.getContext('2d',{willReadFrequently: true,});
o134.id='id14';
try{while(document.removeChild(document.firstChild));}catch(e){}
o298=document.implementation.createHTMLDocument();
o298.body.appendChild(o133);
document.appendChild(o298.documentElement);
o254.filter=' url(#id14) url(#id14) ';
o0.write('<html><body></body></html>');
o254.fillRect(545259505,-1,8200,14942208);

Attached file
[testcase from comment 0](attachment.cgi?id=8772455)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8772455&action=edit)

This crashes a recent release copy of Dev Edition (Firefox 49) on Mac so hunting this down shouldn't be restricted to folks who have a linux ASAN build:
[bp-c826173c-2f50-41bc-b80e-c8faa2160719](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/c826173c-2f50-41bc-b80e-c8faa2160719)
Nils: if you have these testcases as files already it would be more convenient for us if you added them as attachments (which can be done as part of the initial filing; doesn't need to be a second step) rather than in comment text.

Beta (Firefox 48) and the latest ESR-45 don't crash with the attached testcase. Provisionally looks like this regressed during Firefox 49 development. Possibly the underlying problem found by ASAN goes back further and a second change turns it into an active crash so we'll need to double-check the affected versions once the bug has been identified.

This is an overkill - we are checking in a few places. Canvas... change on its own will fix the crash, as would the change in Filter... on its own (though we have to remove an assert MOZ\_ASSERT(!filter.mPrimitives.IsEmpty()); and replace it with an actual check)
Don't know which one makes more sense, if either.

So callers of nsFilterInstance::GetFilterDescription are supposed to handle empty filters, because nsFilterInstance::GetFilterDescription explicitly returns an empty description if the instance is in an error state (!IsInitialized()). Other parts of nsFilterInstance to use IsInitialized() to bail out before calling a FilterSupport function. If mPrimitiveDescriptions.IsEmpty(), mInitialized / IsInitialized() will always be false. So nsFilterInstance itself is fine.
All the static FilterSupport methods assume that the description has at least one primitive.
So our checks need to be in CanvasRenderingContext2D before we call any FilterSupport method, and ideally before we do other work that is unnecessary if we bail out. And we need to document in FilterSupport.h that you're not allowed to call the static methods with empty filter descriptions.
In CanvasRenderingContext2D, we call NeedToApplyFilter() before we construct the AdjustedDrawTargetForFilter. NeedToApplyFilter() checks state.filter.mPrimitives.Length(). Why is that check not saving us here?Flags: needinfo?(mstange)

Because AdjustedTargetForFilter constructor calls UpdateFilter() before calling FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions()? If UpdateFilter() changes things so that there are no primitives, we'll still end up proceeding.Flags: needinfo?(mstange)

Can we call UpdateFilter() before we create AdjustedTargetForFilter? Maybe the whole updateFilterOnWriteOnly if should go into NeedToApplyFilter(). Not sure I understand the purpose of updateFilterOnWriteOnly completely.

Yes we could UpdateFilter() before we create AdjustedTargetForFilter, tho this will then run before every draw. At the moment we only call it when setting the filter property. Some filters use SourceGraphic and thus need to be updated whenever the canvas gets tainted (e.g. after a drawImage command). Thats what the updateFilterOnWriteOnly flag is for. If we call UpdateFilter() before every AdjustedTargetForFilter, we don't need updateFilterOnWriteOnly.Flags: needinfo?(bugs)

This seems to stop the crashes for me
If we don't the real fix, or the real fix isn't appropriate for an uplift (this is sec-critical, so we may end up going to ESR), let's get this band-aid patch reviewed.

How confident are you in the fix? I also don't see this signature showing up in any volume in crash-stats. I would rather we come up with a good fix rather than something unsure that we have to put into late beta (heading into beta 7 now with a week left till we build the RC). If we feel that the risk is higher of shipping this regression we could still take a patch with sec-approval. Is there a good reason we didn't back out the regressing patch?Flags: needinfo?(milan)

Right - my patch is a wallpaper - just deals with the symptom (null pointer), and stops the crash. The real fix deals with the cause, and makes it so that we never get the null pointer in that location. In other words, the real fix will make the wallpaper patch unnecessary.
We do not have any crashes on this - not really - the few that show up are in 47. I do not, however, know how bad of an attack vector this would be, so I don't want a zero day :) Maybe somebody from security can chime in and tell us if this worries them more than usual.Flags: needinfo?(milan)

Your patch fixes what you described in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1287316#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - global-buffer-overflow in mozilla::gfx::FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions") and [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1287316#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - global-buffer-overflow in mozilla::gfx::FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions"): an empty array leading to an attempt to access element[-1]. But that should end up in an intentional crash (InvalidArrayIndex\_CRASH()) and doesn't jibe with my crash in pixman from [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1287316#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - global-buffer-overflow in mozilla::gfx::FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions") ([bp-c826173c-2f50-41bc-b80e-c8faa2160719](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/c826173c-2f50-41bc-b80e-c8faa2160719)) nor Nils' stack writing to 0x7f229cbe8f90 (near nsTArray::sEmptyHdr). Does InvalidArrayIndex\_CRASH() get compiled away in release builds?
The wallpaper patch is safe enough to uplift to beta, if it's fixing the right problem. I'd prefer all those MOZ\_ASSERT()s be MOZ\_RELEASE\_ASSERT() instead (if we hit them we know we're in trouble). \_That\_ change might be risky for beta, but we're not seeing crashes in those functions and if those conditions are hit then I'd expect we're already crashing.
There are 40+ crashes since July. Not many, but some. We could be missing a whole bunch, though, because a direct query doesn't pick up my crash from [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1287316#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - global-buffer-overflow in mozilla::gfx::FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions"). Is there a way to search for FilterSupports in the stack when it's not the crashing signature?

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry for the delay here. Yes, this patch will fix this bug, and I think we should upgrade the MOZ\_ASSERTs to MOZ\_RELEASE\_ASSERTs. They shouldn't ever fail, and if they do, crashing is better than continuing. And the checks are cheap.
I'm having my doubts about the whole updateFilterOnWriteOnly mechanism - as far as I can tell, if ctx.filter is set while the canvas is still in the readable state, and if it then turns write-only after the second draw, updateFilterOnWriteOnly will be false, and the filter will not be updated, so feDisplacementFilters that take the source graphic as their map input will not be replaced with pass-through filters the way they should be. But that's a different bug which I will file tomorrow.

The other thing I'd like to understand is why CanvasFilterChainObserver::DoUpdate isn't called when the referenced element is removed from the document.

This seems to stop the crashes for me
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not sure
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The assertions paint a bulls-eye on the problem but they don't hint on how you'd construct an exploit for it.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Central, Aurora, and Beta. This hasn't been released yet.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Should be identical, the code hasn't changed since 49
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely - it's a wallpaper patch that only kicks in if we know we're in a bad place. Shouldn't need much testing.Flags: needinfo?(mstange)

I count 33 of these crashes since July 1st, and 57 (so, let's say double) that have FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions anywhere in the signature:

This is a regression in 49 ([bug 1174278](/show_bug.cgi?id=1174278 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make filter tainting and canvas tainting interact properly")), so 45 should not be affected.

Oh. :-(
Yes, looking at the code again, only the check in the AdjustedTargetForFilter constructor allows failure; the release asserts in the destructor all crash.
However, the big difference is that these crashes are safe crashes. They are not exploitable.
[Bug 1298552](/show_bug.cgi?id=1298552 "RESOLVED FIXED - Canvas filters allow feDisplacementMaps to be applied to cross-origin images, allowing timing attacks on them") will fix these crashes, but it's not going to be in 49.Flags: needinfo?(mstange)

The good news is those two reports seem to be the only two with that signature so it doesn't look like we're tripping those MOZ\_RELEASE\_ASSERT's in normal use (at least with the beta population). We can still consider this bug "fixed" and follow-up in [bug 1298552](/show_bug.cgi?id=1298552 "RESOLVED FIXED - Canvas filters allow feDisplacementMaps to be applied to cross-origin images, allowing timing attacks on them")Crash Signature: [@ \_moz\_pixman\_region32\_copy ]

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

It looks like we're destroying the timeline without unregistering from the refresh driver. Presumably this happens because we release the document created with Document.write (and we don't go through the usual presshell/refreshdriver destruction that we would for regular documents).

I wonder if we fail this test here: <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/740bb4ed16d070cf5d466231b30e80b9204aec54/dom/base/nsDocument.cpp#2133>
Or if we simply fail to call Reset at all.

It's going to take a few days to triage and assign this properly (it always takes me a while to get an ASAN build going, especially with the fuzzing extension, but this time it appears I have to rebuild clang too). Anyway, it's at the top of my list.Flags: needinfo?(bbirtles)

Actually this works correctly, but after it,
o856.currentTime = 183;
here, we re-observed the same refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::NotifyAnimationUpdated.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/0ba72e8027cf/dom/animation/DocumentTimeline.cpp#l130>
Should we nullify all animations' mTimeline when nsDocument::Reset?

Oh, so the reset happens in f1 when we call document.write()? That makes sense.
> Should we nullify all animations' mTimeline when nsDocument::Reset?
I haven't looked into this properly, but I'm not sure if that works. I think we only store a reference to animations that are currently active (e.g. when NeedsTicks() returns true or some other changes has happened causing them to request a tick) so we couldn't get to them all by iterating over AnimationTimeline::mAnimations. If an animation was paused it might not be in the timeline's list of animations but if it was resumed it would end up calling NotifyAnimationUpdated(). Unless you mean to traverse the document and get all the animations that way?
I wonder if instead, after we get a call to NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying we could set a flag on the timeline. Then in NotifyAnimationUpdated() we could just skip re-adding to the refresh driver in that case. I'm not sure if we should clear that flag on a subsequent call to NotifyRefreshDriverCreated, but I suppose we should.
Would that work?

I meant to traverse all the animations. I did't think it's a good idea though.

Yes, this should work. A remaining concern is that when we can change the old timeline to a new one. Is it unnecessary? I don't remember we set timeline when the animation is associated with a document.

So there appear to be a few problems here:
a. We can have a situation where we have a cycle between a DocumentTimeline and
an Animation (i.e. where they are the only things keeping each other alive).
When we break that cycle, there is nothing that causes the DocumentTimeline
to be removed from its refresh driver. (The assertion in ~DocumentTimeline
that checks mIsObservingRefreshDriver is false should fail in this case but
this is an opt build so it doesn't show up above.)
b. Even after calling NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying() we can still end up
calling GetRefreshDriver() from DocumentTimeline::NotifyAnimationUpdated and
re-registering with the (supposedly) destroyed refresh driver.
This is surprising, I would have thought that the pres context would not
return a valid refresh driver after we call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying()
but I \*think\* what happens is that we don't actually destroy the refresh
driver in nsDocument::Reset but we simply call that method as a means of
getting the timeline to disassociate itself from the refresh driver before
it is destroyed. The version history seems to show this too:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/84169b40100b4248f0cbdfbd0e42e27e358d5e80>
So I think there are a few things we can do here:
1. Set a flag in DocumentTimeline::NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying to indicate
"refresh driver has been destroyed" and, in
DocumentTimeline::GetRefreshDriver(), return nullptr when that flag is set.
In DocumentTimeline::NotifyRefreshDriverCreated we would clear the flag.
2. Make DocumentTimeline::Unlink unregister from the refresh driver.
3. Make Animation::Unlink call DocumentTimeline->RemoveAnimation.
4. In ~DocumentTimeline unregister from the refresh driver.
(1) alone would fix this bug, but I think we should probably do something
along the lines of (2) or (3) or both as well. We probably don't need (4) and
can just leave the assertion there---or should we convert it to a MOZ\_CRASH?
For now I'll just do (1) and (2).

On further thought, while (1) would fix \*this\* bug, we could have a very similar bug which would not be fixed by (1) if instead of using the default document timeline, we use a separately constructed timeline (i.e. using `new DocumentTimeline`) since we won't call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying on that. So probably the minimum requirement for fixing this is (2). I'll make these up as separate patches and we can decide which to land where.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

Attached patch

[Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline](attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1291665&attachment=8781395)

This is approach (1) from [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1291665#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsRefreshDriver::Tick"). I think [attachment 8781392](/attachment.cgi?id=8781392 "Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781392&action=edit "Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781392&action=diff "Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1291665&attachment=8781392) is enough and we don't need to land this patch to fix this bug.
However, I think it's a bug that we call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroyed and then sometimes re-register with it anyway.
We should either:
i. Not call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroyed from nsDocument::Reset
ii. Land this patch sometime.
(i) seems simpler but I'm not sure if eagerly disassociating from the refresh driver might have other benefits such as releasing resources sooner and stopping the refresh driver from spinning. On the other hand, perhaps it could be argued that the default document should keep functioning even after the document is destroyed (like document timelines created using `new DocumentTimeline`).
So I'm not quite sure what to do here, but I'm posting this patch for now since we might use it later.

It would be nice that we have a utility function which does;
refreshDriver->RemoveRefreshObserver(this, Flush\_Style);
mIsObservingRefreshDriver = false;
and reuse the function in NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying() or rename NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying in a later bug?

Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline

-----------------------------------------------------------------
I am stamping this patch as r+ too.

+1 to land this later.

Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink
I am sorry, I accidentally set r+ against the test case.

Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not too easily. It's clear the bug relates to failing to unregister from the refresh driver, but you have to be lucky with GC timing to trigger the bug (or find a way of forcing GC to happen at the right time--is there a way, other than using a chrome-privileges API to do that?).
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No, however they make it clear that sometimes we fail to unregister from the refresh driver (which one could easily guess implies a UAF).
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
At least up to 48. I believe this was introduced in [bug 1195180](/show_bug.cgi?id=1195180 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tick animations from their timeline") which landed in 44, so I expect ESR45 is affected.
> If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
([Bug 1195180](/show_bug.cgi?id=1195180 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tick animations from their timeline"))
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not yet but I can easily prepare them. They should not be very different, very difficult to create, or risky.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely to cause regressions. I have yet to run it through try for fear of exposing the vulnerability. Please advise how to proceed.
