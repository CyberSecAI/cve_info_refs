### Description

**Bamboo** had a resource that deserialised input from build agents and did not sufficiently restrict which classes could be deserialised. To exploit this issue, attackers need to have a valid **Bamboo** agent fingerprint or be able to run code on a **Bamboo** agent.

**Affected versions:**

* All versions of **Bamboo** from 2.3.1 before 5.11.4.1 (the fixed version for 5.11.x) and from 5.12.0 before 5.12.3.1 (the fixed version for 5.12.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

**Fix:**

* Bamboo 5.12.3.1 is available for download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download>.
* Bamboo 5.11.4.1 is available for download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download-archives>.

**Acknowledgements:**

We would like to credit Moritz Bechler of AgNO3 for reporting this issue to us.

Bamboo - Deserialisation resulting in remote code execution caused by insufficient restriction on permitted deserialised classes.

Note: As of  September 2014 we are no longer issuing binary bug patches, instead we create new maintenance releases for the major versions we are backporting.

Date of Advisory:  20 Jul 2016 10 AM PDT  (Pacific Time, -7 hours)

CVE ID:

* CVE-2016-5229 - Deserialisation in Bamboo.

Product: Bamboo

Affected Bamboo product versions:

* 2.3.1 <= version < 5.11.4.1
* 5.12.0 <= version < 5.12.3.1

  Note: Bamboo version 5.10.0 and higher are not vulnerable if the "whitelist" option for XStream Serialisation is active. Prior to the fix versions listed below Bamboo defaulted to using a blacklist approach for XStream Serialisation. See [Serialization protection methods](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gJOzLw) for information on serialisation settings.

Fixed Bamboo product versions:

* for 5.11.x, Bamboo**5.11.4.1** has been released with a fix for this issue.
* for 5.12.x, Bamboo**5.12.3.1** has been released with a fix for this issue.

### **Summary of Vulnerability**

This advisory discloses a **critical severity** security vulnerability which was introduced in version 2.3.1 of Bamboo.Versions of Bamboostarting with 2.3.1 before 5.11.4.1 (the fixed version for 5.11.x) and from 5.12.0 before 5.12.3.1 (the fixed version for 5.12.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

**Atlassian Cloud** instances have **already been upgraded** to a version of Bamboo which does **not** have the issue described on this page.

**Customers who have upgraded Bamboo to version 5.11.4.1 or version 5.12.3.1** **are** **not affected****.**

#### **Customers who have downloaded and installed Bamboo >= **2.3.1** less than 5.11.4.1 (the fixed version for 5.11.x)**

#### **Customers who have downloaded and installed Bamboo >= 5.12.0 less than 5.12.3.1 (the fixed version for 5.12.x)**

Please **upgrade** your Bamboo installations **immediately** to fix this vulnerability.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to credit **Moritz Bechler of AgNO3** for reporting this issue to us.

### **Deserialisation resulting in remote code execution caused by insufficient restriction on permitted deserialised classes (CVE-2016-5229)**

**Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

**Description**

Bamboo had a resource that deserialised input from build agents and did not sufficiently restrict which classes could be deserialised. To exploit this issue, attackers need to have a valid Bamboo agent fingerprint or be able to run code on a Bamboo agent.

All versions of **Bamboo** from 2.3.1 before 5.11.4.1 (the fixed version for 5.11.x) and from 5.12.0 before 5.12.3.1 (the fixed version for 5.12.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:
[BAM-17736](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-17736)
-
Getting issue details...
STATUS

**Mitigation**

This issue can be mitigated in Bamboo version 5.10.0 and higher by setting the XStream Serialisation setting to "whitelist" which prior to the fix versions detailed in this advisory was not the default. See [Serialization protection methods](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gJOzLw) for information on serialisation settings.

**Fix**

We have taken the follow steps to address this issue:

1. ReleasedBamboo version 5.12.3.1 that contains fixes for this issue.
2. ReleasedBamboo version 5.11.4.1 that contains fixes for this issue.

## **What You Need to Do**

**Upgrade (recommended)**

The vulnerabilities and fix versions are described in the description section above. Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest version. This upgrade will automatically reconfigure your Bamboo to use a secure deserialisation mode.

**Upgrade Bamboo to version **5.12.3.1** or higher.**

If you are running**Bamboo 5.11.x****and** **cannot upgrade to bamboo 5.12.3.1** **then****upgrade to version 5.11.4.1.**

If you are running **Bamboo 5.10.x** and **cannot upgrade** to 5.11.4.1 or 5.12.3.1 then you can follow following steps to mitigate the issue:

1. Log in to Bamboo as an administrator and go to **Bamboo administration > Security > Security settings**which is found at**/admin/configureSecurity.action** for your Bamboo instance, for example <http://bamboo-host/bamboo/admin/configureSecurity.action>
2. Under the **Serialization protection methods**section, set the XStream setting to **Whitelist**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Check that XStream is set to **Whitelist** after reloading the Security Settings page.

See [Serialization protection methods](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gJOzLw) for information on serialisation settings.

For a full description of the latest version of Bamboo, see [the release notes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Bamboo%2Breleases). You can download the latest version of Bamboo from [the download centre](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download).
