**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient restriction on permitted classes during deserialization of input from build agents in Atlassian Bamboo.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted deserialization of input from build agents.
- Insecure use of XStream serialization that defaults to blacklist approach instead of a whitelist.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to have a valid Bamboo agent fingerprint or be able to run code on a Bamboo agent to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Valid Bamboo agent fingerprint
- Ability to execute code on a Bamboo agent.
