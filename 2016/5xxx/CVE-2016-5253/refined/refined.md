Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5253:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how the Mozilla updater handles the `callback application path` parameter during the update process on Windows systems. Specifically, when the updater is launched with a user-supplied path via the callback parameter, it creates a copy of the specified file with a `.moz-callback` extension. If a hard link is present at the destination of this copied file, the hard link can cause the arbitrary file to be overwritten, even without direct write access to the targeted file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The core weakness lies in the ability of a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system, bypassing normal file access controls.
*   **Hard Link Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating hard links using tools like `CreateHardlink` to set a destination where the callback file should be copied.
*   **Insecure Callback Handling:** The updater does not adequately validate or sanitize the `callback application path`, leading to the file overwrite issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability doesn't directly grant higher privileges, the ability to overwrite system files that are executed by privileged processes could be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** By replacing legitimate files with malicious ones, an attacker can gain control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability by running a command with arbitrary arguments, which is used to initiate the updater with the malicious `callback application path`.
*   **Command Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting the updater with the specially crafted `callback application path` parameter.
*   **Hard Link Creation:** The attacker leverages tools to create a hard link to the target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have local access to the Windows system.
*   **Ability to Execute Commands:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands with arbitrary arguments.
*   **Knowledge of Hard Links:** The attacker should understand how hard links work on Windows.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the updater to prevent the continuation of the update process if copying the callback executable fails. The fix includes a check to prevent the file copy, and if the copy fails, the update is aborted to avoid the file overwrite.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows and does not affect Linux or OS X.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Holger Fuhrmannek.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 48 and later versions.
*   The bug report includes a proof-of-concept (POC) that demonstrates the vulnerability and its potential impact.

This vulnerability was assigned a "moderate" severity.
