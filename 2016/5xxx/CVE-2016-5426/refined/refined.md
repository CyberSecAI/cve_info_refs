Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5426:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided documents directly mention CVE-2016-5426 as related to PowerDNS and specifically describe the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The PowerDNS Authoritative Server accepted DNS queries with a QNAME (fully qualified domain name) longer than 255 bytes. The QNAME is the domain name that is being queried in a DNS request.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   -  Improper input validation: The server did not validate the length of the QNAME in a DNS query, allowing overly long names to be processed. This could lead to excessive resource consumption by the backend.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted DNS queries with overly long QNAMEs, an attacker could cause an abnormal load on the PowerDNS backend, potentially resulting in degraded service or a partial denial of service. SQL backends are mentioned as particularly vulnerable if not sized to handle the increased load.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   -  Remote, unauthenticated attacker could send crafted DNS query packets.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated
   - They need to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable PowerDNS server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was addressed in PowerDNS Authoritative Server version 3.4.10 and later versions.
*   A workaround was suggested: use `dnsdist` with specific rules to block queries with long QNAMEs.
*   The related commit is [https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/881b5b03a590198d03008e4200dd00cc537712f3](https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/881b5b03a590198d03008e4200dd00cc537712f3)
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3664-1) also addresses this issue, in version 3.4.1-4+deb8u6.
*   The `chopOff` function was modified to handle dots inside labels
