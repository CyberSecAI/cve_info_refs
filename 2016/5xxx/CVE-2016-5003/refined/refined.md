### CVE-2016-5003
Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Apache XML-RPC library's (ws-xmlrpc) ability to deserialize untrusted Java objects through the `<ex:serializable>` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary weakness is the deserialization of untrusted Java objects, which allows attackers to inject malicious code into the application's execution flow.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `org.apache.xmlrpc.parser.XmlRpcResponseParser:addResult(Object)` method.
*   The `enabledForExtensions` setting, if enabled, allows automatic deserialization of the `<ex:serializable>` elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server or client by sending a specially crafted XML-RPC request containing a malicious serialized Java object within the `<ex:serializable>` tag.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** This vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **XML-RPC Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted XML-RPC request with a malicious serialized Java object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send XML-RPC requests to the vulnerable server or client.
*   **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability is exploitable without requiring authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects both XML-RPC servers and clients.
*   The vulnerability is present when `enabledForExtensions` is set to true.
*   The vulnerability was detected in XMLRPC-common-Central-3.1.3, but it applies to other versions as well.
*   The vulnerability is different from CVE-2019-17570, which involves a different deserialization issue.
*   Red Hat has released security updates (RHSA) to address this vulnerability.
*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit is available online
