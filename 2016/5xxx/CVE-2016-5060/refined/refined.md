Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation when handling user-provided data. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the `description`, `email`, and `username` parameters before storing them in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters (`description`, `email`, `username`), which are then stored in the system. When other users access this stored data, the malicious script is executed in their browsers within the context of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to:
    - Steal sensitive information, such as session cookies.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying user profiles or executing administrative tasks.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface or otherwise modify the application interface

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/user/save` endpoint containing the malicious payload in the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `/user/save` endpoint of the nGrinder application.
- The attacker can be an authenticated user who can modify his profile or a malicious user that has been able to create a profile.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in nGrinder v3.3.
- The vulnerable parameters include `description`, `email`, and `username`.
- A sample malicious payload `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` is provided.
- The vulnerability was fixed in nGrinder 3.4, released on 24.05.2016.
