## MITIGATION

Navis reports that they have released custom patches on August 10, 2016, for the Navis WebAccess application, which is a legacy product that is in use by thirteen customers around the world, five of which are in the United States. The SQL injection vulnerability, which targeted publicly available news-pages in the application, was brought to Navis’ attention on August 9, 2016. Navis reports that they have contacted all their affected customers and that all customers in the United States have implemented the fix.

Navis recommends that all Navis WebAccess users should install the available patch as soon as possible.

In the event a Navis customer has questions regarding this issue, they are encouraged to contact customer support through the Navis Collaboration Portal at [www.navis.com](http://www.navis.com).

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize the potential damage of a successful SQL injection attack by minimizing the privileges assigned to every database account to only what is necessary.
* Minimize network exposure for all systems supporting control systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.ICS-CERT ALERT, http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01, web site last accessed August 18, 2016.
* Locate systems and devices supporting control system networks behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
