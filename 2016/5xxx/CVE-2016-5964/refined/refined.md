- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate account lockout settings in IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager Virtual Appliance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient account lockout mechanism allows for brute-force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can potentially brute force account credentials. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, though the impact is limited to confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager Virtual Appliance and the ability to send login requests.
