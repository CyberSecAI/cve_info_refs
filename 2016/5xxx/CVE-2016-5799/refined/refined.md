**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper restriction on excessive authentication attempts. This allows an attacker to use brute force to determine the parameters needed to bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could bypass authentication and log in as a valid user.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send repeated authentication requests. No user interaction is required.
