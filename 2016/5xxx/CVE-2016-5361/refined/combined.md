[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2603)

## Topic

An update for libreswan is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Libreswan is an implementation of IPsec & IKE for Linux. IPsec is the Internet Protocol Security and uses strong cryptography to provide both authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to build secure tunnels through untrusted networks such as virtual private network (VPN).

Security Fix(es):

* A traffic amplification flaw was found in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) protocol. A remote attacker could use a libreswan server with IKEv1 enabled in a network traffic amplification denial of service attack against other hosts on the network by sending UDP packets with a spoofed source address to that server. (CVE-2016-5361)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Libreswan VPN software

Libreswan is a *free software* implementation of the most widely
supported and standardized VPN protocol using **"IPsec"**
and the *Internet Key Exchange* (**"IKE"**). These
standards are produced and maintained by the *Internet Engineering Task Force*
(**"IETF"**).

Libreswan has been under active development for over 20
years, going back to The FreeS/WAN Project founded in 1997 by John
Gilmore and Hugh Daniel. For more information, see the project's
[History](/wiki/History).
Libreswan supports IKE versions 1 and 2. It runs on Linux 2.4 to 5.x, FreeBSD and Apple OSX.
On Linux, it uses the built-in **"XFRM"** IPsec stack (linux-ipsec).
It uses the [NSS](/wiki/Using_NSS_with_libreswan) crypto library.
The list of supported RFC's can be found at [Implemented standards](/wiki/Implemented_Standards).

### Download

Libreswan is licensed under the *GNU Public License* ("**GPLv2**"). See the
[License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
It ships as part of many Linux distributions, including Fedora,
RHEL/EPEL and Arch Linux and can be installed on those systems using
the native software management tools. The source code is available
as tarball and via our git repository. Older versions, patches and
pre-compiled versions are available on our download site.

### Configuration examples

Common configuration examples can be found in our [Wiki](/wiki/Configuration_examples).
Furthermore, our [test cases](https://github.com/libreswan/libreswan/tree/master/testing/pluto) also
document our behaviour. You can find test case results and log files on our daily testing site at
[testing.libreswan.org](https://testing.libreswan.org/). And of course, the manual
page of [ipsec.conf](/man/ipsec.conf.5.html) documents the configuration options as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1308508#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-02-15 12:32:52 UTC  ``` It was reported that IKE/IKEv2 protocol is vulnerable to DoS amplification attack.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1308508#c2)  Paul Wouters    2016-02-16 21:15:50 UTC  ``` Some comments:  "The first is that a proper IKE_SA_INIT packet will result in an unknown number of packets from the responder over an unspecified period of time."  This is incorrect. IKEv2 responders _never_ retransmit. So for each received IKE_INIT request it will send at most one IKE_INIT response. Which you noticed too:  "A majority of these (3.9 million) only replied with a single packet"  Next:  "The second is that the responder is expecting abuse and will not maintain any state related to unauthenticated peers.  What this tells us in theory is that IKE infrastructure as designed might be susceptible to abuse for the sake of reflection and amplification DDoS attacks."  I do not understand this remark. Any server exposed to the internet should be designed against DDoS attacks. The IKEv2 protocol does this very well. libreswan supports this with various ddos- options that can be tweaked when needed, but provides sane defaults.  Next:  "These standards say that the sender of a packet should set a timer and a counter, and upon failure of a response packet, they should attempt a packet retransmission.  These  retransmissions should be sent using an exponential back­off and should continue retransmission until the counter is exhausted or a reply is received."  That is clearly only valid for IKEv1. For IKEv1, we use exponential back-off. In all openswan versions this was 20s, 40s, 60s, 60s... For libreswan this is 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s. The timeout for openswan was 5 minutes, for libreswan it is 30 seconds.  "ultimately triggering an amplification ranging from 2%  to 7,933%"  These numbers of out real context, don't mean much.  "In this traffic sample a host configured to respond 10 times was targeted at random of all 10 count hosts, it was sent a packet with a randomized SPI every .1 seconds for a total of 100 packets. "  This makes no sense. You configured a host to reply 10 times? Well, that's not a valid IKEv2 host then, so your custom protocol can amplify 10 times?  "The easiest and suggested way to mitigate this attack would be a blanket policy dropping all inbound UDP traffic sourcing from port 500 where possible."  That would be blocking legitimate IKE traffic. Why would you do that? It would break any device attempting to use IKE/IPsec.  "If the affected machine is another IKEv2 node that requires port  500 be open for operational purposes rate limiting that ultimately leads to blocking would be the next best option."  "A rate limiting strategy is recommended,"  See "man ipsec.conf" and look for ddos-mode, ddos-ike-treshold and max-halfopen-ike  "However, we also know that a  single request can trigger multiple responses over fairly long windows of time"  Not for openswan/libreswan. Especially not in IKEv2.  "Another option and likely more successful strategy would be utilizing outbound rate­limiting and dropping outbound traffic.  Preferably both of these measures could be combined to help prevent your infrastructure from being leveraged for DDoS abuse. "  Nothing should be done outside of /etc/ipsec.conf configuration. And even there the defaults are very sane.  " In their current state we believe they could be leveraged to attack those same businesses and organizations around the Internet with crippling success."  I suggest you take it up to the IETF to obsolete the UDP protocol and find a replacement with the same features we need from UDP that lacks the downsides of UDP. I wish you good luck :)  I would like to close this bug as WONTFIX   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1308508#c3)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1308508#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-02-15 12:32:52 UTC  ``` It was reported that IKE/IKEv2 protocol is vulnerable to DoS amplification attack.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1308508#c2)  Paul Wouters    2016-02-16 21:15:50 UTC  ``` Some comments:  "The first is that a proper IKE_SA_INIT packet will result in an unknown number of packets from the responder over an unspecified period of time."  This is incorrect. IKEv2 responders _never_ retransmit. So for each received IKE_INIT request it will send at most one IKE_INIT response. Which you noticed too:  "A majority of these (3.9 million) only replied with a single packet"  Next:  "The second is that the responder is expecting abuse and will not maintain any state related to unauthenticated peers.  What this tells us in theory is that IKE infrastructure as designed might be susceptible to abuse for the sake of reflection and amplification DDoS attacks."  I do not understand this remark. Any server exposed to the internet should be designed against DDoS attacks. The IKEv2 protocol does this very well. libreswan supports this with various ddos- options that can be tweaked when needed, but provides sane defaults.  Next:  "These standards say that the sender of a packet should set a timer and a counter, and upon failure of a response packet, they should attempt a packet retransmission.  These  retransmissions should be sent using an exponential back­off and should continue retransmission until the counter is exhausted or a reply is received."  That is clearly only valid for IKEv1. For IKEv1, we use exponential back-off. In all openswan versions this was 20s, 40s, 60s, 60s... For libreswan this is 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s. The timeout for openswan was 5 minutes, for libreswan it is 30 seconds.  "ultimately triggering an amplification ranging from 2%  to 7,933%"  These numbers of out real context, don't mean much.  "In this traffic sample a host configured to respond 10 times was targeted at random of all 10 count hosts, it was sent a packet with a randomized SPI every .1 seconds for a total of 100 packets. "  This makes no sense. You configured a host to reply 10 times? Well, that's not a valid IKEv2 host then, so your custom protocol can amplify 10 times?  "The easiest and suggested way to mitigate this attack would be a blanket policy dropping all inbound UDP traffic sourcing from port 500 where possible."  That would be blocking legitimate IKE traffic. Why would you do that? It would break any device attempting to use IKE/IPsec.  "If the affected machine is another IKEv2 node that requires port  500 be open for operational purposes rate limiting that ultimately leads to blocking would be the next best option."  "A rate limiting strategy is recommended,"  See "man ipsec.conf" and look for ddos-mode, ddos-ike-treshold and max-halfopen-ike  "However, we also know that a  single request can trigger multiple responses over fairly long windows of time"  Not for openswan/libreswan. Especially not in IKEv2.  "Another option and likely more successful strategy would be utilizing outbound rate­limiting and dropping outbound traffic.  Preferably both of these measures could be combined to help prevent your infrastructure from being leveraged for DDoS abuse. "  Nothing should be done outside of /etc/ipsec.conf configuration. And even there the defaults are very sane.  " In their current state we believe they could be leveraged to attack those same businesses and organizations around the Internet with crippling success."  I suggest you take it up to the IETF to obsolete the UDP protocol and find a replacement with the same features we need from UDP that lacks the downsides of UDP. I wish you good luck :)  I would like to close this bug as WONTFIX   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1308508#c3)  Huzaifa S.

> Can a CVE id be please assigned to this?

CVE IDs are not assigned to UDP protocols solely on the basis of an
observed amplification-attack risk. A CVE ID can exist if the UDP
reply traffic simply cannot ever have any legitimate purpose for users
of a protocol. The general case of the interaction between UDP
amplification and CVE was discussed between MITRE and CERT in 2013;
this may be the reason that no CVE ID is listed in the
<https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/419128> document.

We can, however, assign a CVE ID to a vendor's announcement of a
required security update, such as on the <https://libreswan.org/> home
page:

  "libreswan 3.16 vulnerable to DDOS attack. Please upgrade to 3.17"

Use CVE-2016-5361 for this issue only in the libreswan codebase.

> This is tracked via upstream bug:

> <https://bugs.libreswan.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262>

We don't think that Bug 262 tracks this "one update to libreswan IKEv1
to reduce amplification caused by retransmits" issue. Bug 262 is about
a possible functionality problem in the 3.17 release, It is marked
"Importance: Low enhancement."

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c0)  Jaroslav Aster    2016-02-18 16:01:25 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  ipsec barf does not show pluto log correctly in the output. It shows all lines related to all pluto's runs from pluto log, because there is bad grep pattern 'Starting Pluto subsystem' in /usr/libexec/ipsec/barf. This pattern is not part of pluto log file on rhel-7 anymore. ipsec barf on rhel-6 works fine.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  libreswan-3.15-5.el7_1  How reproducible:  100%  Steps to Reproduce:  rhel-7:  # grep -n 'Starting Pluto subsystem' /var/log/secure  # grep -n 'Starting Pluto' /var/log/secure 59:Feb 18 09:31:24 qeos-37 pluto[14452]: Starting Pluto (Libreswan Version 3.15 XFRM(netkey) KLIPS NSS DNSSEC FIPS_CHECK LABELED_IPSEC LIBCAP_NG LINUX_AUDIT XAUTH_PAM NETWORKMANAGER CURL(non-NSS) LDAP(non-NSS)) pid:14452 2560:Feb 18 10:07:29 qeos-37 pluto[15707]: Starting Pluto (Libreswan Version 3.15 XFRM(netkey) KLIPS NSS DNSSEC FIPS_CHECK LABELED_IPSEC LIBCAP_NG LINUX_AUDIT XAUTH_PAM NETWORKMANAGER CURL(non-NSS) LDAP(non-NSS)) pid:15707  You can see that first, old, 'Starting Pluto' is on line 59 and the second, current, is on line 2560.  # ipsec barf show ... + _________________________ plog + egrep -i pluto + case "$1" in + cat + sed -n '59,$p' /var/log/secure Feb 18 09:31:24 qeos-37 pluto[14452]: Starting Pluto (Libreswan Version 3.15 XFRM(netkey) KLIPS NSS DNSSEC FIPS_CHECK LABELED_IPSEC LIBCAP_NG LINUX_AUDIT XAUTH_PAM NETWORKMANAGER CURL(non-NSS) LDAP(non-NSS)) pid:14452 ...  Actual results:  ipsec barf shows all lines related to all pluto's runs from pluto log.  Expected results:  ipsec barf shows lines only for current run from pluto log.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c1)  Paul Wouters    2016-02-19 14:18:04 UTC  ``` This is due to _plutorun not being used with systemd (which printed the "subsystem" line). the pluto daemon itself prints "Starting Pluto", so the barf command should grep for that instead to match either case.  A fix was pushed upstream. It would come into 7.3 via a rebase.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c3)  Jaroslav Aster    2016-07-20 13:48:15 UTC  ``` Hi Paul,  unfortunately, this bug is not fixed. It does not show last ipsec's log only. Switching it to assigned state.    You added journalctl command to show last ipsec's log in ipsec barf command.  journalctl -u ipsec.service --since '1 hour ago'  This command shows all ipsec's logs newer then one hour, but you want to show only last ipsec's log. If ipsec runs longer than one hour, journalctl does not show all log. If ipsec runs less then one hour and there was at least one previous ipsec's run, journalctl shows more then last log.  There is another issue with journalctl. journalctl has a default pager, so if the log is longer then one page, default pager is run and you can not see what ipsec barf printed before. You have to use --no-pager option to avoid journalctl's pager.  You can use this command to show last ipsec's log. I know it is not elegant, but it illustrates what I mean.  last_ipsec_run="$(date -d "$(grep 'Starting Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec...' /var/log/messages | tail -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 1,2,3)" '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" journalctl --unit ipsec.service --no-page --since "$last_ipsec_run"  I see, there is a fallback on systems where journalctl does not exist or it is not executable. It uses sed. This fallback does not seem be fixed too. It shows much more information than journalctl version.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c4)  Paul Wouters    2016-07-22 13:18:46 UTC  ``` There can be arbitrary many logs in the system for ipsec. We cannot just go back and list all the logs. the "barf" command is meant to run as a test tool for enduers to give the developers a snapshot of the system and what happened.  If you want all the logs, you should configure logfile=/some/pluto.log instead and barf won't do the log part, or you can run journalctl manually and decide how far you want to look back.  if systemd adds an option to journalctl to show "logs since start of service" then we can change this behaviour to use that. but the man page of journalctl did not show me that option.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c5)  Jaroslav Aster    2016-08-04 13:21:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Paul Wouters from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c4)) > There can be arbitrary many logs in the system for ipsec.

Understand, but I reported this ticket, because ipsec barf on rhel-7 does not show logs for last ipsec run as it shows on rhel-6. In current release, it still does not show logs for the last ipsec run, so for me, this bug is not fixed. If you think it is not a bug, we can close the ticket, without that, I can not verify this bug, because reported issue is not fixed.   > If you want all the logs, you should configure logfile=/some/pluto.log > instead and barf won't do the log part, or you can run journalctl manually > and decide how far you want to look back.  I want ipsec barf to work as it works on rhel-6.  > if systemd adds an option to journalctl to show "logs since start of > service" then we can change this behaviour to use that. but the man page of > journalctl did not show me that option.  No, journalctl does not have this option, but I gave you a workaround how to find out the time when last ipsec has started.  last_ipsec_run="$(date -d "$(grep 'Starting Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec...' /var/log/messages | tail -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 1,2,3)" '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"  Then you can use this datetime in journalctl.  journalctl --unit ipsec.service --no-page --since "$last_ipsec_run"  Whether or not you will decide use this, you have to add, at least, --no-page option, because without that journalctl starts pager and pager removes all previous ipsec barf output. It's stupid, but it's sytstemd :-(. You can test it yourself with ipsec logs longer than one page.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c6)  Paul Wouters    2016-08-04 15:41:02 UTC  ``` Why are you assuming /var/log/messages exists on systemd systems? I think that is only true if someone installed rsyslog along with systemd.  ipsec barf shows for me near the end:  + dmesg + egrep -i 'klips|ipsec' [89888.010280] IPv4 over IPsec tunneling driver + _________________________ plog + test -x /usr/bin/journalctl + journalctl -u ipsec.service --since '1 hour ago' -- Logs begin at Mon 2016-08-01 15:44:00 EDT, end at Thu 2016-08-04 11:31:06 EDT. -- + _________________________ date + date Thu Aug  4 11:32:51 EDT 2016  which seems to match journalctl -u ipsec.service --since '1 hour ago'  # journalctl --unit ipsec.service  --since '1 hour ago' -- Logs begin at Mon 2016-08-01 15:44:00 EDT, end at Thu 2016-08-04 11:31:06 EDT. --  It shows no logs because I have logfile= set. When I unset that, syslog is used. It shows a lot of data and "ipsec barf" ends on the journalctl pager. But redirecting with "ipsec barf > out" works properly and all logs show up in the file including all the parts before the journalctl command is issued:  head -10 out  root@bofh7:/var/www/cgi-bin# head -10 out bofh7.nohats.ca Thu Aug  4 11:35:32 EDT 2016 + _________________________ version + ipsec --version Linux Libreswan 3.15 (netkey) on 3.10.0-327.22.2.el7.x86_64 + _________________________ /proc/version + cat /proc/version Linux version 3.10.0-327.22.2.el7.x86_64 (builder.centos.org) (gcc version 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-9) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Thu Jun 23 17:05:11 UTC 2016 + _________________________ /proc/net/ipsec_eroute + test -r /proc/net/ipsec_eroute   So I cannot reproduce your problem, and I think we cannot add any code that relies on /var/log/messages being present. I think a bug/feature request can be send to systemd to ask for "all logs since last service start", however that would also not be ideal to use, for instance if the pluto daemon crashes, and you want to send us a bunch of debug logs, you would want it to cover before the crash as well, so I believe saying "the last hour" is better.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c7)  Jaroslav Aster    2016-08-11 11:19:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to Paul Wouters from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c6)) > Why are you assuming /var/log/messages exists on systemd systems?

You are right.  > It shows a lot of data and "ipsec barf" ends on the journalctl pager. > But redirecting with "ipsec barf > out" works properly and all logs show up > in the file including all the parts before the journalctl command is issued:  Run pager inside program is stupid and it's against unix philosophy. It's up to users whether or not they use | and less/more. I know, I can redirect all output into the file or use '| less' and journalctl detects it, but I do not see any reason why restrict users to print _all_ ipsec barf output on the console if they want.  > So I cannot reproduce your problem, and I think we cannot add any code that > relies on /var/log/messages being present.

Ok. I agree with change ipsec barf's output. What you wrote makes sense, but I have to insist on '--no-pager' option.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c8)  Jaroslav Aster    2016-08-11 13:55:44 UTC  ``` Two notes:  1,  It would be fine to have updated ipsec_barf man-page. There is a description how ipsec barf works, but there is no mention about journalctl.  2,  It is not redhat-7 issue, but there is a fall-back for systems which do not use systemd. This fall-back has not been changed in the new version, so it still uses string 'Starting Pluto subsystem' for grep, see first comment. Is it ok?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1309764#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-03 21:22:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
