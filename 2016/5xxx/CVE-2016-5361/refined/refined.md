{
  "CVE-2016-5361": {
    "Description": "A traffic amplification flaw was found in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) protocol. A remote attacker could use a libreswan server with IKEv1 enabled in a network traffic amplification denial of service attack against other hosts on the network by sending UDP packets with a spoofed source address to that server.",
    "Root cause": "The IKEv1 protocol has a traffic amplification vulnerability due to the way retransmissions are handled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Traffic amplification vulnerability in IKEv1 protocol."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can leverage the vulnerability to conduct a network traffic amplification denial of service (DoS) attack against other hosts on the network.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sends UDP packets with a spoofed source address to a vulnerable libreswan server with IKEv1 enabled."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets with a spoofed source address to a vulnerable libreswan server.",
        "Additional Details": [
            "The vulnerability is specific to the IKEv1 protocol, and not IKEv2.",
            "Libreswan versions before 3.17 are vulnerable.",
            "The issue is due to retransmissions behavior in IKEv1."
        ]
