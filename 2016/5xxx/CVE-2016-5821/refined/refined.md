Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5821

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insecure Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the Huawei HiSuite service directory ("C:\ProgramData\HandSetService\"). These ACLs allow any authenticated user to create new files in the directory.
- The HiSuite service (HuaweiHiSuiteService64.exe), which runs with SYSTEM privileges, attempts to load certain DLL files (e.g., SspiCli.dll, USERENV.dll) from its service directory when starting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Directory Permissions:** The service directory has write permissions for all authenticated users, which should not be the case for a service running with SYSTEM privileges.
- **DLL Hijacking:** The service loads DLL files from a user-writable directory, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local, authenticated attacker can gain SYSTEM privileges.
- The attacker can place a malicious DLL with a name expected by the service in the vulnerable directory. When the service restarts (after reboot or service restart), the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed with SYSTEM privileges. This results in full control over the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Huawei HiSuite is installed.
- **File Creation:** The attacker must be able to write files to the "C:\ProgramData\HandSetService\" directory.
- **System Restart:** The attacker needs to either trigger a system reboot or wait for the next system restart for the malicious DLL to be loaded by the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the target Windows system.
- The attacker does not require administrative rights to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to create/write a malicious DLL file into the service directory, and have a method of restarting the system or service so the DLL loads.

**Mitigation:**
- Update to HiSuite version 4.0.4.204\_ove (Out of China) or HiSuite 4.0.4.301 (China) which address the issue.
- Restrict ACLs on the service directory to prevent normal users from writing to this directory.
