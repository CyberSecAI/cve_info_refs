### @andreaskienast **[andreaskienast](/andreaskienast)** commented [Jun 5, 2016](#issue-158546972)

Using \GuzzleHttp\Client without cURL being installed falls back to the

StreamHandler. As documented, guzzle uses a `timeout => 0` setting by

default, if that setting isn't explicitly passed as option. This value

is passed to the context of the stream, causing every request to fail

instantly as `timeout => 0` has a different meaning for streams.

Fixes [#1487](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/1487)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development.

The vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading PHP to the new upstream
version 5.6.24, which includes additional bug fixes. Please refer to the
upstream changelog for more information:

<https://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.24>

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.6.24+dfsg-0+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.9-1 of the php7.0 source package.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2016-8eb11666aa
2016-07-30 18:07:31.268746
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : php
Product : Fedora 24
Version : 5.6.24
Release : 2.fc24
URL : <http://www.php.net/>
Summary : PHP scripting language for creating dynamic web sites
Description :
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

The php package contains the module (often referred to as mod\_php)
which adds support for the PHP language to Apache HTTP Server.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# CVE-2016-5385

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5384.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5386.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5385 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5385)

#### Description

PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (1) an application that makes a getenv('HTTP\_PROXY') call or (2) a CGI configuration of PHP, aka an "httpoxy" issue.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2016-9c8cf5912c
2016-07-28 20:58:22.230454
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : php-guzzlehttp-guzzle6
Product : Fedora 23
Version : 6.2.1
Release : 1.fc23
URL : <http://guzzlephp.org>
Summary : PHP HTTP client library
Description :
Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and trivial
to integrate with web services.

\* Simple interface for building query strings, POST requests, streaming large
uploads, streaming large downloads, using HTTP cookies, uploading JSON data,
etc...
\* Can send both synchronous and asynchronous requests using the same interface.
\* Uses PSR-7 interfaces for requests, responses, and streams. This allows you
to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.
\* Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write
environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL,
PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.
\* Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.

Autoloader: /usr/share/php/GuzzleHttp6/autoload.php

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

## 6.2.1 - 2016-07-18 \* Address HTTP\_PROXY security vulnerability,
CVE-2016-5385: <https://httpoxy.org/> \* Fixing timeout bug with StreamHandler:
<https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/1488> \* Only read up to `Content-Length` in
PHP StreamHandler to avoid timeouts when a server does not honor `Connection:
close`. \* Ignore URI fragment when sending requests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
References:

[ 1 ] Bug #1357582 - php-guzzlehttp-guzzle6-6.2.1 is available
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1357582>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update can be installed with the "yum" update program. Use
su -c 'yum update php-guzzlehttp-guzzle6' at the command line.
For more information, refer to "Managing Software with yum",
available at <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/>.

# CVE-2015-8935

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-8934.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-8936.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-8935 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8935)

#### Description

The sapi\_header\_op function in main/SAPI.c in PHP before 5.4.38, 5.5.x before 5.5.22, and 5.6.x before 5.6.6 supports deprecated line folding without considering browser compatibility, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer by leveraging (1) %0A%20 or (2) %0D%0A%20 mishandling in the header function.

## CGI web servers assign Proxy header values from client requests to internal HTTP\_PROXY environment variables

#### Vulnerability Note VU#797896

Original Release Date: 2016-07-18 | Last Revised: 2016-07-19

---

### Overview

Web servers running in a CGI or CGI-like context may assign client request Proxy header values to internal HTTP\_PROXY environment variables. This vulnerability can be leveraged to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on internal subrequests or to direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts.

### Description

| [**CWE-807**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/807.html)**: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision,** [**CWE-454**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/454.html)**: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores**  Web servers running in a CGI or CGI-like context may assign client request Proxy header values to internal HTTP\_PROXY environment variables. The vulnerable behavior is the result of a naming convention for meta-variables, defined in [RFC 3876](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875), which leads to a name collision: "The HTTP header field name is converted to upper case, has all occurrences of "-" replaced with "\_" and has "HTTP\_" prepended to give the meta-variable name."According to the researchers, a web server is vulnerable if:   1. *A web server, programming language or framework (and in some limited situations the application itself) sets the environmental variable HTTP\_PROXY from the user supplied Proxy header in the web request, or sets a similarly used variable (essentially when the request header turns from harmless data into a potentially harmful environmental variable).* 2. *A web application makes use of HTTP\_PROXY or similar variable unsafely (e.g. fails to check the request type) resulting in an attacker controlled proxy being used (essentially when HTTP\_PROXY is actually used unsafely).*  By sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable server, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to conduct MITM attacks on internal server subrequests or direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts. For more information, refer to [httpoxy.org](https://httpoxy.org/). |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to conduct MITM attacks on internal server subrequests or direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Where applicable, affected products and components should be updated to address this vulnerability. Check with vendors for information about patching.Where patches are unavailable or updating is not an option, consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Filter** **Proxy** **request headers**The researchers and community have identified several filtering strategies that are product-dependent:**Apache/CGI**In this configuration, any language may be vulnerable (the HTTP\_PROXY env var is "real"). If you are using mod\_headers , you can unset the "Proxy" header with this directive:       RequestHeader unset Proxy If you are using mod\_security, you can use a rule like (vary the action to taste):      SecRuleEngine On    SecRule &REQUEST\_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0"    "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'" Refer to [Apache's response](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) for more information.**HAProxy**      httprequest delheader Proxy **lighttpd <= 1.4.40 (reject requests containing "Proxy" header)**Create "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua", read-only to lighttpd, with content:      if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end Modify lighttpd.conf to load mod\_magnet and run lua code      server.modules += ( "mod\_magnet" )    magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" ) **lighttpd2 (development) (strip "Proxy" header from request)**Add to lighttpd.conf:      req\_header.remove "Proxy"; **Nginx/FastCGI**Use this to block the Proxy header from being passed on to PHPFPM, PHPPM, etc.      fastcgi\_param HTTP\_PROXY ; **Nginx with proxy\_pass**The following setting should work for people who are using "proxy\_pass" with nginx:      proxy\_set\_header Proxy ; Microsoft has provided the following guidance for IIS servers utilizing affected third-party frameworks:**Microsoft IIS Mitigation steps:**Update apphost.config with the following rule:  <system.webServer>    <rewrite>        <rules>            <rule name=3D"Erase HTTP\_PROXY" patternSyntax=3D"Wildcard">                <match url=3D"\*.\*" />                <serverVariables>                    <set name=3D"HTTP\_PROXY" value=3D />                </serverVariables>                <action type=3D"None" />            </rule>        </rules>    </rewrite></system.webServer> |

### [Apache HTTP Server Project](#BLUU-ABSLHW) Affected

Notified:  July 12, 2016  Updated: July 18, 2016

**Statement Date:   July 14, 2016**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Apache Software Foundation has discovered no examples of condition 2 described in the [redacted] report, and has determined there is no "vulnerability" per se in ASF software, which conform to both RFC822 (circa 1982) and CGI/1.1 defacto standard (circa 1995, superseded by CGI/1.1 IANA spec RFC 3875).

Several ASF projects participate in HTTP requests in the manners described under condition 1. The list of projects that will offer one or more mitigations include but are not limited to;

Apache HTTP Server (httpd) (Tracked as CVE-2016-5387)
Apache Tomcat Server (Tracked as CVE-2016-5388)
Apache Traffic Server (ATS) (Tracking is not applicable)

Projects and subprojects impacted by the Apache HTTP Server mitigations will include mod\_fcgid (Apache HTTP Project) and mod\_perl (Apache Perl Project), as well as external projects such as mod\_wsgi, all hopefully under CVE-2016-5387.

Note specifically that any CVE related to mod\_fcgi[d] must be ignored, as it duplicates CVE-2016-5387. We have not reached a conclusion on separate tracking that might be unique to mod\_perl itself (thus far, it also appears to duplicate -5387.)

### [lighttpd](#JLAD-ABZJ3A) Affected

Updated:  July 19, 2016

**Statement Date:   July 19, 2016**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Mitigation of httpoxy is available in lighttpd.

Mitigation:

lighttpd <= 1.4.40 (reject requests containing "Proxy" header)

\* Create "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua", read-only to lighttpd, with content:
if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end

\* Modify lighttpd.conf to load mod\_magnet and run lua code
server.modules += ( "mod\_magnet" )
magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )

lighttpd2 (development) (strip "Proxy" header from request)
\* Add to lighttpd.conf: req\_header.remove "Proxy";

Reference:

\* lighttpd 1.4 repo contains fix on git master branch to strip "Proxy" header and the commit message below contains the above mitigation steps for lighttpd 1.4.x <https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/779c133c16f9af168b004dce7a2a64f16c1cb3a4>

An update that fixes 9 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for php5 fixes the following issues:
\* It is possible to launch a web server with "php -S localhost:8080" It
used to be possible to set an arbitrary $HTTP\_PROXY environment variable
for request handlers -- like CGI scripts -- by including a specially
crafted HTTP header in the request (CVE-2016-5385). As a result, these
server components would potentially direct all their outgoing HTTP
traffic through a malicious proxy server. This patch fixes the issue:
the updated php server ignores such HTTP headers and never sets
$HTTP\_PROXY for sub-processes. (bnc#988486)
\* There was multiple cases where a remote attacker could trigger a double
free and, given specific PHP code using callbacks, trigger code
execution vectors. (bnc#986246,bnc#986244,CVE-2016-5768,CVE-2016-5772)
\* It was possible to inject header or content information (XSS) when a
user was using internet explorer as the browser. (bnc#986004,
CVE-2015-8935)
\* In several cases it was possible for a integer overflow to trigger an
excessive memory allocation (bnc#986392, bnc#986388, bnc#986386,
bnc#986393, CVE-2016-5770, CVE-2016-5769, CVE-2016-5766, CVE-2016-5767)
\* It was possible for an attacker to abuse the garbage collector to free a
target array. At this point an attacker could craft a fake zval object
and exploit the PHP process by taking over the EIP/RIP. (bnc#986391,
CVE-2016-5771)

## Synopsis

Moderate: php security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1613)

## Topic

An update for php is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache HTTP Server.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that PHP did not properly protect against the HTTP\_PROXY variable name clash. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a PHP script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5385)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, an incorrect logic in the SAPI header callback routine caused that the callback counter was not incremented. Consequently, when a script included a header callback, it could terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. With this update, the callback counter is properly managed, and scripts with a header callback implementation work as expected. (BZ#1346758)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-08 03:17:13 UTC  ``` Dominic Scheirlinck of VendHQ reports:  Many software projects and vendors have implemented support for the “Proxy” request header in their respective CGI implementations and languages by creating the “HTTP_PROXY” environmental variable based on the header value. When this variable is used (in many cases automatically by various HTTP client libraries) any outgoing requests generated in turn from the attackers original request can be redirected to an attacker controlled proxy. This allows attackers to view potentially sensitive information, reply with malformed data, or to hold connections open causing a potential denial of service.   The PHP web framework contains will automatically populate the HTTP_PROXY environmental variable with a user supplied "Proxy" header.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-08 03:17:18 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Scott Geary (VendHQ)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c2)  Doran Moppert    2016-07-08 04:44:16 UTC  ``` There are several possible deployment scenarios for PHP.  Under the most common (apache + mod_php(sapi)), it appears to be safe:    - HTTP_PROXY makes it into $_SERVER, but not $_ENV   - builtin curl functions are not affected   - the variable does not leak into subprocesses through exec() or system()  This covers the most likely vectors.  The client-provided value is returned by php function getenv('HTTP_PROXY') or getenv('http_proxy') (the argument is case-insensitive), which may still lead to vulnerabilities in naively-written modules which expect this function to be similar to libc's getenv(3).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c3)  Doran Moppert    2016-07-08 05:00:14 UTC  ``` php in CGI configuration:    - HTTP_PROXY makes it into the process environment   - also into subprocesses through system()/exec()   - builtin libcurl only honours http_proxy, but not HTTP_PROXY    Tested with apache:    <FilesMatch \.php$>     SetHandler application/x-httpd-php   </FilesMatch>   Action application/x-httpd-php /cgi-bin/php-cgi   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2016-07-13 09:16:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to Doran Moppert from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c2)) > This covers the most likely vectors. >  > The client-provided value is returned by php function getenv('HTTP_PROXY') > or getenv('http_proxy') (the argument is case-insensitive), which may still > lead to vulnerabilities in naively-written modules which expect this > function to be similar to libc's getenv(3).  Note that the original reporter argues that the use of getenv('HTTP_PROXY') may not be as unlikely as it might seem, providing Guzzle HTTP client as an example of a widely used PHP application affected by this issue in the mod_php use case.  <https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/443a7a62/src/Client.php#L166>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c9)  Remi Collet    2016-07-13 09:43:50 UTC  ``` getenv is case sensitive on Linux (can insensitive only on Windows)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2016-07-13 10:22:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to Remi Collet from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c9)) > getenv is case sensitive on Linux (can insensitive only on Windows)  Are you referring to this Doran's comment?  (In reply to Doran Moppert from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c2)) > The client-provided value is returned by php function getenv('HTTP_PROXY') > or getenv('http_proxy') (the argument is case-insensitive),  Apparently, PHP's getenv() is case insensitive under mod_php (apache2handler), but sensitive under CGI (cgi-fcgi).  There does not seem to be a difference between real process environment and SAPI environment, so getenv('path') and getenv('http_proxy') return the same result as getenv('PATH') and getenv('HTTP_PROXY').   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c23)  Remi Collet    2016-07-22 07:45:12 UTC  ``` Upstream commit  <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=98b9dfaec95e6f910f125ed172cdbd25abd006ec>   Additional commit adding a FPM unit test (5.6+) <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=fb4a6dc0f1df106dae84c9d8f3ec53cc0da7231b>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-11 20:48:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS  Via RHSA-2016:1610 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1610.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-11 21:36:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS  Via RHSA-2016:1612 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1612.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-11 21:36:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS  Via RHSA-2016:1611 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1611.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-11 21:53:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:1609 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1609.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1353794#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-11 22:10:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:1613 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1613.html>   ``` |  |

## Description

PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (1) an application that makes a getenv('HTTP\_PROXY') call or (2) a CGI configuration of PHP, aka an "httpoxy" issue.

## A CGI application vulnerability (in 2016) for PHP, Go, Python and others

*httpoxy* is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. It comes
down to a simple namespace conflict:

* RFC 3875 (CGI) puts the HTTP `Proxy` header from a request into the environment variables as `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTP_PROXY` is a popular environment variable used to configure an outgoing proxy

This leads to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. If youâre running PHP or CGI, you should block the `Proxy` header.
[Hereâs how.](#fix-now)

httpoxy is a vulnerability for server-side web applications. If youâre not deploying code, you donât need to worry.

#### What can happen if my web application is vulnerable?

If a vulnerable HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI application, an
attacker may be able to:

* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy

httpoxy is extremely easy to exploit in basic form. And we expect security
researchers to be able to scan for it quickly. Luckily, if you read on and
find you are affected, [easy mitigations](#fix-now) are available.

## Isnât this old news? Is this still a problem?

httpoxy **was disclosed in mid-2016**. If youâre reading about it now for the first time, you can *probably* relax and
take your time reading about this quaint historical bug that *hopefully* no longer affects any of the applications you
maintain. But you should verify that to your own satisfaction.

The content below this point reflects the original disclosure, and Iâll be leaving the site up and mostly unchanged, other
than noting fix versions where I can. I guess Iâm just saying: the time for urgency was last year.

## What Is Affected

A few things are necessary to be vulnerable:

* Code running under a CGI-like context, where `HTTP_PROXY` becomes a real or emulated environment variable
* An HTTP client that trusts `HTTP_PROXY`, and configures it as the proxy
* That client, used within a request handler, making an HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) request

For example, the confirmed cases weâve found so far:

| Language | Environment | HTTP client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP | php-fpm  mod\_php | Guzzle 4+  Artax |
| Python | wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler  twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript | requests |
| Go | net/http/cgi | net/http |

But obviously there may be languages we havenât considered yet. CGI is a common standard, and
`HTTP_PROXY` seems to be becoming more popular over time. Take the below as a sample of the most
commonly affected scenarios:

### PHP

* Whether you are vulnerable depends on your specific application code and PHP libraries, but the problem
  seems fairly widespread
* Just *using* one of the vulnerable libraries, while processing a userâs request, is exploitable.
* If youâre using a vulnerable library, this vulnerability will affect any version of PHP
  + It even affects alternative PHP runtimes such as HHVM deployed under FastCGI
* It is present in Guzzle, Artax, and probably many, many libraries
  + Guzzle versions in the range `>=4.0.0rc2,<6.2.1` are vulnerable, Guzzle 3 and below is not.
  + Another example is (update: was) in Composerâs StreamContextBuilder utility class

So, for example, if you are using a Drupal module that uses Guzzle `6.2.0` and makes an outgoing HTTP request (for example,
to check a weather API), you are vulnerable to the request that plugin makes being âhttpoxiedâ.

### Python

* Python code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code
  will use a CGI handler like `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`
  + This is not considered a normal way of deploying Python webapps (most people are using WSGI or FastCGI, both of which are
    not affected), so vulnerable Python applications will probably be much rarer than vulnerable PHP applications.
  + wsgi, for example, is not vulnerable, because os.environ is not polluted by CGI data
* Vulnerable versions of the requests library will trust and use `os.environ['HTTP_PROXY']`, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in `2.7.13`, `3.4.6`, `3.5.3`, `3.6.0` (see [the Python advisory](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/cve-2016-1000110_httpoxy_attack.html))

### Go

* Go code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code uses
  the `net/http/cgi` package.
  + As with Python, this is not considered a usual way of deploying Go as a web application, so this vulnerability should be
    relatively rare
  + Goâs `net/http/fcgi` package, by comparison, does not set actual environment variables, so it is *not* vulnerable
* Vulnerable versions of `net/http` will trust and use `HTTP_PROXY` for outgoing requests, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in Go `1.7rc3`, all stable versions of `>=1.7`

## Immediate Mitigation

The best immediate mitigation is to block `Proxy` request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your
application. This is easy and safe.

* Itâs safe because the `Proxy` header is undefined by the IETF, and isnât listed on the
  [IANAâs registry of message headers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml). This means
  **there is no standard use for the header at all**; not even a provisional use-case.
* Standards-compliant HTTP clients and servers will never read or send this header.
* You can either strip the header or completely block requests attempting to use it.
* You should try to do your mitigation as *early* and as far *upstream* as you can.
  + Do it âat the edgeâ, where HTTP requests first enter your system.
  + That way, you can fix lots of vulnerable software at once.
  + Everything behind a reverse proxy or application firewall that strips the `Proxy` header is safe!

How you block a `Proxy` header depends on the specifics of your setup. The earliest convenient place to block the header
might be at a web application firewall device, or directly on the webserver running Apache or NGINX. Here are a few of
the more common mitigations:

### NGINX/FastCGI

Use this to block the header from being passed on to PHP-FPM, PHP-PM etc.

```
fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";

```

In FastCGI configurations, PHP is vulnerable (but many other languages that use NGINX FastCGI are not).

For specific NGINX coverage, we recommend that you read the official [NGINX blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-the-httpoxy-vulnerability-with-nginx)
on this vulnerability. The blog post provides a graphic depiction of how
httpoxy works and more extensive mitigation information for NGINX.

### Apache

For specific Apache coverage (and details for other Apache software projects like Tomcat), we strongly recommend
you read the [Apache Software Foundationâs official advisory](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) on
the matter. The very basic mitigation information youâll find below is covered in much greater depth there.

If youâre using Apache HTTP Server with `mod_cgi`, languages like Go and Python may be vulnerable (the `HTTP_PROXY` env var
is ârealâ). And `mod_php` is affected due to the nature of PHP. If you are using **mod\_headers**, you can unset the
`Proxy` header before further processing with this directive:

```
RequestHeader unset Proxy early

```

Example for using this in `.htaccess` files:

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
   RequestHeader unset Proxy
</IfModule>

```

If you are using **mod\_security**, you can use a `SecRule` to deny traffic with a `Proxy` header. Hereâs an example,
vary the action to taste, and make sure `SecRuleEngine` is on. The 1000005 ID has been assigned to this issue.

```
SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0" "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'"

```

Finally, if youâre using Apache Traffic Server, itâs not itself affected, but you can use it to strip the `Proxy` header; very helpful
for any services sitting behind it. Again, see the [ASFâs guidance](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt),
but one possible configuration is:

* Within `plugin.config`, inside the configuration directory (e.g. `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver` or `/etc/trafficserver`),
  add the following directive:

  ```
  header_rewrite.so strip_proxy.conf

  ```
* Add the following to a new file named `strip_proxy.conf` in the same directory:

  ```
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  rm-header Proxy

  ```

### HAProxy

This will strip the header off requests:

```
http-request del-header Proxy

```

If your version of HAProxy is old (i.e. `1.4` or earlier), you may not have the `http-request del-header` directive.
If so, you must also take care that headers are stripped from requests served after the first one over an HTTP 1.1
keep-alive connection. (i.e. take special note of the limitation described in the first paragraph of [the 1.4 âheader
manipulationâ documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.4/configuration.html#6))

### Varnish

For Varnish, the following should unset the header. Add it to the pre-existing vcl\_recv section:

```
sub vcl_recv {
    [...]
    unset req.http.proxy;
    [...]
}

```
### OpenBSD relayd

For relayd, the following should remove the header. Add it to a pre-existing filter:

```
http protocol httpfilter {
        match request header remove "Proxy"
}

```
### lighttpd

#### <= 1.4.40

To reject requests containing a `Proxy` header

* Create `/path/to/deny-proxy.lua`, read-only to lighttpd, with the content:

  ```
  if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end

  ```
* Modify `lighttpd.conf` to load `mod_magnet` and run the above lua code:

  ```
  server.modules += ( "mod_magnet" )
  magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )

  ```

#### lighttpd2 (development)

To strip the `Proxy` header from the request, add the following to `lighttpd.conf`:

```
req_header.remove "Proxy";

```
### Microsoft IIS with PHP or a CGI framework

For detailed information about mitigating httpoxy on IIS, you should
head to the official [Microsoft article KB3179800](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3179800), which covers
the below mitigations in greater detail.

Also important to know: httpoxy does not affect any Microsoft Web Frameworks, e.g. not ASP.NET nor Active Server Pages.
But if you have installed PHP or any other third party framework on top of IIS, we recommend applying mitigation steps
to protect from httpoxy attacks. You can either block requests containing a `Proxy` header, or clear the header. (The header
is safe to block, because browsers will not generally send it at all).

To *block* requests that contain a `Proxy` header (the preferred solution), run the following command line.

```
appcmd set config /section:requestfiltering /+requestlimits.headerLimits.[header='proxy',sizelimit='0']

```

**Note:** `appcmd.exe` is not typically in the path and can be found in the `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv` directory

To *clear* the value of the header, use the following URL Rewrite rule:

```
<system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
        <rules>
            <rule name="Erase HTTP_PROXY" patternSyntax="Wildcard">
                <match url="*.*" />
                <serverVariables>
                    <set name="HTTP_PROXY" value="" />
                </serverVariables>
                <action type="None" />
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </rewrite>
</system.webServer>

```

**Note:** URL Rewrite is a downloadable add-in for IIS and is not included in a default IIS installation.

### Hiawatha

You can block any request containing a `Proxy` header (or ban the sending client) via the UrlToolkit:

```
UrlToolkit {
  ToolkitID = block_httpoxy
  Header Proxy .* DenyAccess
}

```

See more information at the [hiawatha blog](https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/weblog/115)

### LiteSpeed Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 5.0.19` or `>= 5.1.7` to mitigate. You can do this manually with one of these commands, or youâll get
an upgrade notification soon.

```
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.0.19 # or
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.1.7

```

See more information at the [litespeed blog](http://blog.litespeedtech.com/2016/07/18/the-httpoxy-vulnerability-has-been-taken-care-of-by-litespeed-automatically/)

### h2o Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 2.0.2` and add this to your configuration:

```
setenv:
  HTTP_PROXY: ""

```

More information can be found in this [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/996).

### Other CGI software and applications

Please let us know of other places where httpoxy is found. Weâd be happy to help you communicate fixes for your platform,
server or library if you are affected. Contact contact@httpoxy.org to let us
know. Or create a PR or issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org) in GitHub.

## Ineffective fixes in PHP

Userland PHP fixes donât work. Donât bother:

* Using `unset($_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY'])` does not affect the value returned from `getenv()`, so is not an effective
  mitigation
* Using `putenv('HTTP_PROXY=')` does not work either (to be precise: it only works if that value is coming from an
  actual environment variable rather than a header â so, it cannot be used for mitigation)

## Prevention

### Summary

* If you can avoid it, do not deploy into environments where the CGI data is merged into the actual environment variables
* Use and expect `CGI_HTTP_PROXY` to set the proxy for a CGI applicationâs internal requests, if necessary
  + You can still support `HTTP_PROXY`, but you must assert that CGI is not in use
  + In PHP, check `PHP_SAPI == 'cli'`
  + Otherwise, a simple check is to not trust `HTTP_PROXY` if `REQUEST_METHOD` is also set. RFC 3875 seems to require
    this meta-variable:

    > The `REQUEST_METHOD` meta-variable MUST be set to the method which should be used by the script to process the request

### Donât Trust `HTTP_PROXY` Under CGI

To put it plainly: there is no way to trust the value of an `HTTP_` env var in a CGI environment. They cannot be
distinguished from request headers according to the specification. So, *any* usage of `HTTP_PROXY` in a CGI context is
suspicious.

If you need to configure the proxy of a CGI application via an environment variable, use a variable name that will
never conflict with request headers. That is: one that does not begin with `HTTP_`. We strongly recommend you go for
`CGI_HTTP_PROXY`. (As seen in Ruby and libwww-perlâs mitigations for this issue.)

### PHP

CLI-only code may safely trust `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` or `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`. But bear in mind that code written
for the CLI context often ends up running in a SAPI eventually, particularly utility or library code. And, with open
source code, that might not even be your doing. So, if you are going to rely on `HTTP_PROXY` at all, you should guard
that code with a check of the `PHP_SAPI` constant.

### Network Configuration as Prevention

A defense-in-depth strategy that can combat httpoxy (and entire classes of other security problems) is to severely restrict
the outgoing requests your web application can make to an absolute minimum. For example, if a web application is
firewalled in such a way that it *cannot* make outgoing HTTP requests, an attacker will not be able to receive
the âmisproxiedâ requests (because the web application is prevented from connecting to the attacker).

### HTTPS

And, of course, another defense-in-depth strategy that works is to use HTTPS for internal requests, not just for
securing your siteâs connections to the outside world. HTTPS requests arenât affected by `HTTP_PROXY`.

## How It Works

Using PHP as an example, because it is illustrative. PHP has a method called `getenv()`[1](#fn:php-getenv).

There is a common vulnerability in many PHP libraries and applications, introduced by confusing
`getenv` for a method that only returns environment variables. In fact, getenv() is closer to the
`$_SERVER` superglobal: it contains both environment variables and user-controlled data.

Specifically, when PHP is running under a CGI-like server, the HTTP request headers (data supplied
by the client) are merged into the `$_SERVER` superglobal under keys beginning with `HTTP_`. This is
the same information that `getenv` reads from.

When a user sends a request with a `Proxy` header, the header appears to the PHP application as `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`.
Some common PHP libraries have been trusting this value, even when run in a CGI/SAPI environment.

Reading and trusting `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` is exactly the same vulnerability, but tends to happen much less often
(perhaps because of getenvâs name, perhaps because the semantics of the `$_SERVER` superglobal are better understood among
the community).

### Minimal example code

Note that these examples require deployment into a vulnerable environment before there is actually a vulnerability
(e.g. php-fpm, or Apacheâs `ScriptAlias`)

#### PHP

```
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$client->get('http://api.internal/?secret=foo')

```
#### Python

```
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
def application(environ, start_response):
    requests.get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
CGIHandler().run(application)

```
#### Go

```
cgi.Serve(
    http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        res, _ := http.Get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
        // [...]

```

More complete PoC repos (using Docker, and testing with an actual listener for the proxied request) have been prepared
under the [httpoxy Github organization](https://github.com/httpoxy).

## Why It Happened

Under the CGI spec, headers are provided mixed into the environment variables. (These are formally known as
âProtocol-Specific Meta-Variablesâ[2](#fn:meta-variables)). Thatâs just the way the spec works, not a failure or bug.

The goal of the code, in most of the vulnerabilities, is to find the correct proxy to use, when auto-configuring a
client for the internal HTTP request made shortly after. This task in Ruby could be completed by
the `find_proxy` method of `URI::Generic`, which notes:

> `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` are treated specially under the CGI environment, because `HTTP_PROXY` may be set by Proxy:
> header. So `HTTP_PROXY` is not used. `http_proxy` is not used too if the variable is case insensitive. `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`
> can be used instead.
>
> From the [Ruby stdlib documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/Generic.html#method-i-find_proxy)

Other instances of the same vulnerability are present in other languages. For example, when
using Goâs `net/http/cgi` module, and deploying as a CGI application. This indicates the vulnerability
is a standard danger in CGI environments.

## History of httpoxy

This bug was first discovered over 15 years ago. The timeline goes something like:

March 2001

The issue is discovered in libwww-perl and fixed. Reported by Randal L. Schwartz. [3](#fn:perl-bug)

April 2001

The issue is discovered in curl, and fixed there too (albeit probably not for Windows). Reported by Cris Bailiff. [4](#fn:curl-bug)

July 2012

In implementing `HTTP_PROXY` for `Net::HTTP`, the Ruby team notice and avoid the potential issue. Nice work Akira Tanaka! [5](#fn:ruby-ref)

November 2013

The issue is mentioned on the NGINX mailing list. The user humbly points out the issue: âunless
Iâm missing something, which is very possibleâ. No, Jonathan Matthews, you were exactly right! [6](#fn:nginx-ref)

February 2015

The issue is mentioned on the Apache httpd-dev mailing list. Spotted by Stefan Fritsch. [7](#fn:apache-ref)

July 2016

Scott Geary, an engineer at Vend, found an instance of the bug in the wild. The Vend security team found the vulnerability
was still exploitable in PHP, and present in many modern languages and libraries. We started to disclose to security response teams.

So, the bug was lying dormant for years, like a latent infection: pox. We imagine that many people may have found the issue over
the years, but never investigated its scope in other languages and libraries. If youâve found a historical discussion
of interest that weâve missed, let us know. You can contact contact@httpoxy.org
or create an issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org).

## CVEs

httpoxy has a number of CVEs assigned. These cover the cases where

* a language or CGI implementation makes the `Proxy` header available in such a way that the application cannot tell whether
  it is a real environment variable, or
* an application trusts the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable by default in a CGI environment (but only where that application should have been
  able to tell it came from a request)

The assigned CVEs so far:

* CVE-2016-5385: PHP
* CVE-2016-5386: Go
* CVE-2016-5387: Apache HTTP Server
* CVE-2016-5388: Apache Tomcat
* CVE-2016-6286: spiffy-cgi-handlers for CHICKEN
* CVE-2016-6287: CHICKENâs http-client
* CVE-2016-1000104: mod\_fcgi
* CVE-2016-1000105: Nginx cgi script
* CVE-2016-1000107: Erlang inets
* CVE-2016-1000108: YAWS
* CVE-2016-1000109: HHVM FastCGI
* CVE-2016-1000110: Python CGIHandler
* CVE-2016-1000111: Python Twisted
* CVE-2016-1000212: lighttpd

We suspect there may be more CVEs coming for httpoxy, as less common software is checked over. If you
want to get a CVE assigned for an httpoxy issue, there are a couple of options:

* For open source code projects, you can use the [Distributed Weakness Filing Project](https://distributedweaknessfiling.org/) (DWF).
  They have a simple way to report (public) issues using the form at [iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)
* For closed source code projects, you can talk to [MITRE, or one of their participating CNAs/vendors/coordinators](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html).

could. Weâd like to thank the members of:

* The Red Hat Product Security team, who provided extremely useful advice and access to their experience disclosing
  widespread vulnerabilities - if youâre sitting on a big or complicated disclosure, theyâre a great resource to reach
  out to for help.
* The language and implementation teams, who kept to disclosure norms and provided lively discussion.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2016-4e7db3d437
2016-07-28 20:58:53.012584
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : php-guzzlehttp-guzzle6
Product : Fedora 24
Version : 6.2.1
Release : 1.fc24
URL : <http://guzzlephp.org>
Summary : PHP HTTP client library
Description :
Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and trivial
to integrate with web services.

\* Simple interface for building query strings, POST requests, streaming large
uploads, streaming large downloads, using HTTP cookies, uploading JSON data,
etc...
\* Can send both synchronous and asynchronous requests using the same interface.
\* Uses PSR-7 interfaces for requests, responses, and streams. This allows you
to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.
\* Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write
environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL,
PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.
\* Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.

Autoloader: /usr/share/php/GuzzleHttp6/autoload.php

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

## 6.2.1 - 2016-07-18 \* Address HTTP\_PROXY security vulnerability,
CVE-2016-5385: <https://httpoxy.org/> \* Fixing timeout bug with StreamHandler:
<https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/1488> \* Only read up to `Content-Length` in
PHP StreamHandler to avoid timeouts when a server does not honor `Connection:
close`. \* Ignore URI fragment when sending requests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
References:
