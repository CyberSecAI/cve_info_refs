  "CVE-2016-5706": {
    "Description": "js/get_scripts.js.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large array in the scripts parameter.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the way phpMyAdmin loads JavaScript files, specifically how it handles a large array in the 'scripts' parameter within the `js/get_scripts.js.php` file.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource consumption"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a crafted request containing a large array in the 'scripts' parameter. This can lead to resource exhaustion, making the phpMyAdmin service unavailable.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based attack"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The attack is launched through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint."
