Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-5750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the iManager certificate server snap-ins of NetIQ Access Manager, which allows the creation of user certificates. A flaw in these snap-ins permits the upload of JSP (JavaServer Pages) files, which, when processed by iManager, can lead to the execution of arbitrary system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The iManager certificate server snap-ins do not properly validate the type of file being uploaded. This allows an attacker to upload malicious JSP files.
- **JSP File Interpretation:** The uploaded JSP files are interpreted and executed by iManager, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary system commands on the server.
- **Temporary File Handling:** When a certificate creation process is canceled after the file upload, the uploaded file is not immediately deleted from the temporary folder, which is accessible through the web server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability exists because the certificate creation process doesn't properly sanitize the input and treat uploaded files as if they were simple certificates rather than potentially malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This can be leveraged to create new local administrator accounts on the server.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker could gain full control of the system, leading to data breaches or complete system compromise.
- **Remote Access:** An attacker could establish a remote access point, for example by enabling remote desktop and accessing it through the newly created administrator account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the iManager web interface.
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious JSP file disguised as a certificate.
- **Request Manipulation:** A proxy server (or Fiddler) is needed to intercept the upload request and replay it to exploit the flaw of the cancelled upload not deleting the temporary file.
- **Direct File Access:** Attacker directly accesses the uploaded file from a temporary folder via a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the iManager certificate server snap-ins.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the iManager server.
- **Ability to Intercept HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and replay HTTP requests, using a tool like a HTTP proxy or Fiddler.
- **Understanding of JSP Files:** The attacker needs knowledge to create malicious JSP files that perform desired system commands.
- **Understanding of the iManager web interface:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to use the iManager to carry out the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit involves canceling a certificate creation process after uploading a file.
- The vulnerability exists in NetIQ Access Manager versions 4.2 and 4.1.
- Patches for the vulnerability are provided in NetIQ Access Manager 4.2.2 and 4.1.2 Hot Fix 1.
