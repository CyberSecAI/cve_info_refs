Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-5056:

**CVE-2016-5056: Weak Default WPA2 PSKs**

*   **Root Cause:** The OSRAM SYLVANIA Lightify Pro devices used weak default WPA2 pre-shared keys (PSKs). These keys were eight characters long, composed only of hexadecimal characters ("0123456789abcdef").
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Small Keyspace:** The limited character set and short length resulted in a small keyspace, making the PSKs vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Default Keys:** The usage of default keys across devices weakens the security posture of every deployed device.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers could crack the WPA2 authentication handshake, allowing them to gain access to the cleartext WPA2 PSK. This grants unauthorized access to the wireless network of the Pro device, potentially allowing further access and control.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Wireless Network Capture:** An attacker would need to capture the WPA2 authentication handshake process, typically by eavesdropping on the wireless communications.
    *   **Offline Brute-Force:** Once the handshake is captured, the attacker performs a brute-force attack using specialized tools offline to recover the PSK.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range to capture the handshake.
    *   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs the technical skills to capture network traffic and perform WPA2 cracking.
    *   **Specialized Software:** The attacker requires specialized software tools such as aircrack-ng or similar tools.
*   **Additional Information:** The report mentions that one WPA2 PSK was cracked in 5 hours 57 minutes and another in 2 hours and 42 minutes, demonstrating the ease of cracking these keys.
