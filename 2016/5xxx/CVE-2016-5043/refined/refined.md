{
  "vulnerability": "A specially crafted DWARF section results in a read outside the bounds of in-memory data, potentially causing the calling application to crash.",
  "affected_component": "libdwarf",
  "root_cause": "The `dwarf_dealloc()` function in `dwarf_alloc.c` does not validate the `Dwarf_Ptr space` argument before using it, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper bounds check",
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "impact": "A crash of the calling application due to an out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "attack_vector": "A crafted DWARF section in an ELF file that, when processed by `libdwarf`, triggers the vulnerable code path.",
  "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted ELF file with a malicious DWARF section to trigger the vulnerability."
