Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-5679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `transfer_license` command within the `cgi_main` binary. The `sn` parameter, which is meant to hold a serial number, does not properly sanitize user-provided input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The lack of proper input validation on the `sn` parameter leads to command injection. The injected commands are executed on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with the privileges of the user running the web server, which is typically root or admin. This allows complete control over the device.
- **Local Privilege Escalation**:  A logged-in user can exploit this vulnerability locally to escalate privileges to root (on NVRmini2) or admin (on ReadyNAS).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** By sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/cgi_main` endpoint with the `cmd=transfer_license`, `method=offline` and a malicious `sn` parameter.
- **Local Exploitation:** By using the `cgi_main` binary directly with a crafted `sn` parameter through the `CGI_DEBUG` variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the device. The attacker needs an administrator account to exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Local:** An attacker needs to have a user account on the device and be able to run commands. The attacker does not need an administrator account to exploit the vulnerability locally.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

-   NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware versions 1.7.6 to 3.0.0
-   ReadyNAS Surveillance, version 1.1.2

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db content provides concrete examples of how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be exploited both locally and remotely, with slightly different requirements.
- The exploit-db content also mentions that other vulnerabilities are likely exploitable locally.
