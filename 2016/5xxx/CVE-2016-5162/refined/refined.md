Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `AllowCrossRendererResourceLoad` function within `extensions/browser/url_request_util.cc` of Google Chrome. This function incorrectly handles an extension's `manifest.json`'s `web_accessible_resources` field when dealing with IFRAME elements. Specifically, it doesn't properly restrict resource loading based on what's explicitly listed as web accessible in the manifest.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate resource access control:** The `web_accessible_resources` field in an extension's manifest is intended to specify which resources can be accessed from web pages. The vulnerability is that this is bypassed when it comes to IFRAMEs, allowing unauthorized resources to load within an iframe.
*   **Incorrect use of web_accessible_resources**: The check for web accessible resources was not sufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Clickjacking Attacks:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to conduct clickjacking attacks. They could load a malicious extension page inside an iframe, which is not allowed under normal circumstances. By overlaying this iframe with deceptive content, attackers can trick users into interacting with the iframe, potentially leading to unintended actions like changing extension settings.
*   **Tricking users into changing extension settings:** The bypass enables an attacker to potentially modify settings of an extension without the user's direct consent, through a crafted website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted website:** The primary attack vector is a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **IFRAME elements:**  The vulnerability specifically targets how IFRAMEs are handled with extension resources, allowing an attacker to embed unauthorized content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker**: The attacker does not need local access to the user's machine.
*   **Ability to host a webpage:** The attacker must be capable of hosting a webpage with malicious code designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User interaction:** The user must be tricked into interacting with the malicious website to allow the iframe to load and the clickjacking attack to succeed.

**Additional details from the chromium code review:**

* The fix involves ensuring that documents are explicitly listed in the manifest as web accessible for navigations to succeed. This was not properly enforced previously.
* The patch includes changes to `extensions/browser/url_request_util.cc` to properly check the `web_accessible_resources` and ensures that subframes are included in the check, too.
* Testing changes were made to `chrome/browser/extensions/extension_protocols_unittest.cc` and `chrome/browser/extensions/extension_resource_request_policy_apitest.cc` and new test files added to `chrome/test/data/extensions/api_test/extension_resource_request_policy`

**In summary:** CVE-2016-5162 describes a vulnerability in Google Chrome that allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions on IFRAME resource loading, leading to potential clickjacking and unauthorized extension setting changes. The vulnerability is triggered by an incorrectly implemented check that allows iframes to load content that is not explicitly declared as accessible in an extension's manifest.
