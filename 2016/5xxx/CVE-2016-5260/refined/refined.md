    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 48.0 mishandles changes from 'INPUT type=\"password\"' to 'INPUT type=\"text\"' within a single Session Manager session, which might allow attackers to discover cleartext passwords by reading a session restoration file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Firefox's session restore mechanism not properly handling changes in input field types from 'password' to 'text'. When an input field's type is changed, the browser saves the input's data as clear text.",
