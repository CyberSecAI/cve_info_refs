Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-5099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly handle special HTML characters that are passed as URL-encoded values. Specifically, the application performs double URL decoding, which allows for the injection of malicious HTML characters into the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a self-XSS vulnerability. An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML through crafted URL parameters.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The application mishandles URL-encoded input, allowing special HTML characters to bypass sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Self-XSS:** The vulnerability is classified as "self-XSS," meaning that the victim must be tricked into visiting a crafted URL with the malicious payload. In that context, the impact of this vulnerability is considered non-critical.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes special HTML characters encoded using URL encoding, which are then not sanitized properly, due to double decoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Attacker Position:** Remote attacker
- **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific URL with malicious HTML, and the ability to trick a user into visiting the malicious crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.15.6) and 4.6.x (prior to 4.6.2).
- Patches are available in phpMyAdmin versions 4.4.15.6 and 4.6.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered with the help of the Mozilla SOS program.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-661 (Improper Handling of URL Parameters).
- The provided patches remove unnecessary `urlencode/urldecode` steps in multi-submits, addressing the double decoding issue.
