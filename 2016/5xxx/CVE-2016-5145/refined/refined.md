Based on the provided data, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Blink handles the `taint` property of `ImageBitmap` objects after a structure-clone operation. Specifically, the `taint` property, which indicates if the `ImageBitmap` originates from a cross-origin source, is not correctly preserved during the structure-clone operation. This oversight allows for a bypass of the Same Origin Policy (SOP).

**Weakness:**

- **Incorrect Preservation of Taint Property:** The core weakness is the failure to maintain the `taint` property during the structure cloning process of an `ImageBitmap` object derived from a cross-origin image.
- **Same Origin Policy (SOP) Violation**: The SOP is a fundamental browser security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Same Origin Policy Bypass:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to bypass the SOP.
- **Potential for Information Disclosure/Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This bypass could enable an attacker to access sensitive information or potentially inject malicious scripts into a victim's browser if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted JavaScript Code:** The vulnerability is triggered via malicious JavaScript code which can force a structure-clone operation on an `ImageBitmap` object derived from a cross-origin image.
- **Cross-Origin Image Loading**: The attacker needs to load a cross-origin image and create `ImageBitmap` to be able to perform the bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be physically present on the target system and can exploit the vulnerability remotely via the internet.
- **Knowledge of JavaScript and Structure Cloning:** The attacker needs to have a good understanding of JavaScript and how structure-cloning operations function within Blink.
- **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve crafted HTML/JavaScript that loads cross-origin images and manipulates ImageBitmap objects.

**Additional Notes**

- The fix involves ensuring that the taint property of an ImageBitmap is preserved correctly during structure-clone operations.
- Several sources confirm this vulnerability affected chromium based browsers.
- Patches and updates were released to fix the vulnerability in multiple distributions.
