## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Issue [2178513002](/2178513002/): Add layout test to make sure origin clean flag is preserved (Closed)

| **Created:** 4 years, 5 months ago by [xidachen](/user/xidachen)  **Modified:** 4 years, 4 months ago  **Reviewers:** [Justin Novosad](/user/Justin%20Novosad)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, blink-reviews  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | DescriptionAdd layout test to make sure origin clean flag is preserved This CL adds a layout test to make sure that the ImageBitmap's origin clean flag is preserved after ImageBitmap is being transfered or structured-cloned. The test works like this: load a cross-origin image, and create an ImageBitmap from that image. The promise of creating the ImageBitmap should be resolved but the ImageBitmap is tainted. We then transfer the ImageBitmap to the worker, and worker structure-clones the ImageBitmap to the main. We then exam to make sure that the ImageBitmap is still tained.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, August 3, 2016

The stable channel has been updated to 52.0.2743.116 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [10 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-1-M52). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[633486](https://crbug.com/633486)] CVE-2016-5146: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/52.0.2743.82..52.0.2743.116?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in [switching](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) release channels? Find out [how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
