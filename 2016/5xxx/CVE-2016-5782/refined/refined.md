- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The PHP code in Locus Energy meters does not properly validate information sent in POST requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in a PHP script handling energy meter parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain control of the LGate device if its web server port is publicly exposed. This could allow for unauthorized access, manipulation, or disruption of the device's functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or operational disruptions in the connected systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation through a publicly exposed web server port on the LGate device. Attackers can send malicious POST requests to the vulnerable PHP script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the publicly exposed web server port of the LGate device. A low level of technical skill is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
