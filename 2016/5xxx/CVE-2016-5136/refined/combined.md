I think I'd prefer checking the host in ScriptInjection for two reasons: - We should be able to pinpoint when the host can be removed when synchronously injecting (due to blocking) - specifically right after JS injection happens - so there should only be a single check necessary.  In this file, it's not immediately clear when script_ may or may not be null, and I can easily imagine that someone will forget the null check at some point. - This can actually affect programmatic scripts (e.g. tabs.executeScript) as well.  While I don't think anything would necessarily break, I don't think we should be injecting or handling scripts for removed extensions in general. ```     | **robwu** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc File extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc#newcode108 extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc:108: script\_ = nullptr; On 2016/07/06 16:17:58, Devlin wrote: > ... | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-06 16:26:58 UTC) [#19](#msg19) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/use...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc) File extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/use...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc#newcode108) extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc:108: script_ = nullptr; On 2016/07/06 16:17:58, Devlin wrote: > On 2016/07/06 16:12:06, robwu wrote: > > On 2016/07/06 15:22:22, Devlin (ooo - July 6) wrote: > > > We should call ScriptInjection::OnHostRemoved() when the extension is > > unloaded.  > > > If this only happens because of synchronous JS, would a simpler/cleaner > > solution > > > be to check injection_host_ in ScriptInjection() after we inject JS, rather > > than > > > adding a bunch of null checks here? > >  > > I considered it, but because the bug is only related to user scripts, I > decided > > to put the checks in this class, without putting the burden of being aware of > > this subtlety on the user of the class. >  > I think I'd prefer checking the host in ScriptInjection for two reasons: > - We should be able to pinpoint when the host can be removed when synchronously > injecting (due to blocking) - specifically right after JS injection happens - so > there should only be a single check necessary.

I will submit a separate CL since the current patch already landed, and not injecting scripts after removal is a behavioral change (opposed to the current patch, which fixes the bug without other side effects). ```     | **Devlin** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc File extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc#newcode108 extensions/renderer/user\_script\_injector.cc:108: script\_ = nullptr; On 2016/07/06 16:26:57, robwu wrote: > ... | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-06 16:40:56 UTC) [#20](#msg20) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/use...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc) File extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/use...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2116923002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc#newcode108) extensions/renderer/user_script_injector.cc:108: script_ = nullptr; On 2016/07/06 16:26:57, robwu wrote: > On 2016/07/06 16:17:58, Devlin wrote: > > On 2016/07/06 16:12:06, robwu wrote: > > > On 2016/07/06 15:22:22, Devlin (ooo - July 6) wrote: > > > > We should call ScriptInjection::OnHostRemoved() when the extension is > > > unloaded.  > > > > If this only happens because of synchronous JS, would a simpler/cleaner > > > solution > > > > be to check injection_host_ in ScriptInjection() after we inject JS, > rather > > > than > > > > adding a bunch of null checks here? > > >  > > > I considered it, but because the bug is only related to user scripts, I > > decided > > > to put the checks in this class, without putting the burden of being aware > of > > > this subtlety on the user of the class. > >  > > I think I'd prefer checking the host in ScriptInjection for two reasons: > > - We should be able to pinpoint when the host can be removed when > synchronously > > injecting (due to blocking) - specifically right after JS injection happens - > so > > there should only be a single check necessary.

# CVE-2016-5137

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5136.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5138.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5137 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5137)

#### Description

The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs and does not apply ws :80 policies to wss :443 URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. NOTE: this vulnerability is associated with a specification change after CVE-2016-1617 resolution.

# CVE-2016-5135

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5134.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5136.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5135 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5135)

#### Description

WebKit/Source/core/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not consider referrer-policy information inside an HTML document during a preload request, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by a "Content-Security-Policy: referrer origin-when-cross-origin" header that overrides a "<META name='referrer' content='no-referrer'>" element.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[629852](https://crbug.com/629852)] CVE-2016-1705: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

You're right - I solved the issue by constructing a queue of ScriptInjectionWatchers. I also moved the frame logic to active_injection_frames_, so that we can have an early out in the ScriptInjection::Inject (similarly to |injection_host_|).  > Instead, I think we have to keep track of both pending and active injections > during these times, and notify both of extension host removal.  This will > probably render the Watcher class unnecessary.  I added the class to avoid spreeing push_back with a balanced find & erase all over the place. With the watcher class, the watcher is set up when it's constructed and automatically removed upon destruction. ```     | **Devlin** | | https://codereview.chromium.org/2134613002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/script\_injection\_manager.cc File extensions/renderer/script\_injection\_manager.cc (right): https://codereview.chromium.org/2134613002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/script\_injection\_manager.cc#newcode110 extensions/renderer/script\_injection\_manager.cc:110: class ScriptInjectionManager::ScriptInjectionWatcher { I'm still not quite happy with ... | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-11 23:30:55 UTC) [#5](#msg5) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` [https://codereview.chromium.org/2134613002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/scr...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2134613002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/script_injection_manager.cc) File extensions/renderer/script_injection_manager.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2134613002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/scr...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2134613002/diff/20001/extensions/renderer/script_injection_manager.cc#newcode110) extensions/renderer/script_injection_manager.cc:110: class ScriptInjectionManager::ScriptInjectionWatcher { I'm still not quite happy with this implementation.

Currently, when a script is *not* being injected, it is stored in |pending_injections_| or |running_injections_|. If it *is* about to be injected, there will always be a ScriptInjectionWatcher on the stack, which was designed to be resilient against unexpected reentrancy (with respect to the same frame/injection).   > I wonder if there's a way that we can put a little more of this logic into the > ScriptInjection/InjectionHost.

Scripts injection should be aborted in the following cases:  1. Extension unloads. 2. Extension reloads. 3. Frame unloads (includes frame reloads).  Using RendererExtensionRegistry seems to only cover case 1, not case 2.  > I'll think on this a bit more and circle back, but if you had any thoughts, happy to hear them. :)  I only have half-baked thoughts for now. The issue is that InjectionHost and ScriptInjection can outlive each other, so there needs to be some mediator that outlives both (or some token that is reset whenever either of the invalidation events occur). I found this role in the UserScriptManager (and the new watcher). ```     Expand Messages | Collapse Messages | Show Generated Messages | Hide Generated Messages |
