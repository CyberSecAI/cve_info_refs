Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5757:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2016-5757 and explains the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of iframes in the Access Manager Admin Console iManager login page. The lack of proper iframe security allows an attacker to load a malicious webpage through a URL parameter within the iframe.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / IFrame Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject an arbitrary webpage (via URL parameter) into an iframe within the login page. This allows for a phishing attack by showing a fake login page.
- **Lack of proper frame security:** The admin console login page does not restrict the content that can be loaded into its iframes, allowing for malicious content to be displayed.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attack:** An attacker can display a fake login page that mimics the legitimate login page of the Access Manager.
- **Credential Theft:** When a user enters their credentials into the fake login page, the attacker captures the login data (username and password) and sends it to a server under their control, effectively compromising the user's account.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL for the login page that includes a parameter to load an attacker-controlled website into an iframe within the page.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker likely needs to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link or redirecting the user to a crafted login page.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a malicious website:** The attacker needs a server to host the fake login page and receive the stolen credentials.
- **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate URL parameters to inject the malicious website into the iframe.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs a method of delivering the malicious link to the victim in a way that makes the victim believe it is a legitimate login page.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content goes beyond the basic CVE description by explaining a possible workaround by using Tomcat's CORS filter to add a `SAMEORIGIN` header, which would prevent the page from being embedded in a frame from another domain. It also describes in detail how to configure that workaround.
- The patch information points to specific versions of NetIQ Access Manager that address this vulnerability.
