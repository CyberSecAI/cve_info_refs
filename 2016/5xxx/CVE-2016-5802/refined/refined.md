- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple instances of out-of-bounds write conditions exist in the software. These conditions may allow malicious files to be read and executed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerabilities are triggered when a local user opens the vulnerable application and loads a malformed file with a .dvp or other extensions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious file and convince the user to open it using the vulnerable application. The attacker needs local access.
