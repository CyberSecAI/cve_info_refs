  "CVE-2016-5264": {
    "root_cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability when applying effects to SVG elements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) by exploiting a use-after-free vulnerability in the processing of SVG effects, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability through a crafted website."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a specially crafted web page.",
    "details": "Security researcher Nils discovered a use-after-free vulnerability when applying effects to SVG elements. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.",
