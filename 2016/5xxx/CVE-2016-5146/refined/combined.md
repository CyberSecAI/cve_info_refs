## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5144.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5146.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5145 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5145)

#### Description

Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, does not ensure that a taint property is preserved after a structure-clone operation on an ImageBitmap object derived from a cross-origin image, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5143.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5145.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5144 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5144)

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, August 3, 2016

The stable channel has been updated to 52.0.2743.116 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [10 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-1-M52). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[633486](https://crbug.com/633486)] CVE-2016-5146: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/52.0.2743.82..52.0.2743.116?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in [switching](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) release channels? Find out [how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

The Developer Tools (aka DevTools) subsystem in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, mishandles the script-path hostname, remoteBase parameter, and remoteFrontendUrl parameter, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted URL, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5144.
