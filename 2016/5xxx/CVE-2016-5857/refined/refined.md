{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm SPCom driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This is due to a flaw in the Qualcomm SPCom driver.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to a local permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device. The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the kernel context.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local; a malicious application running on the device can exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to run a malicious application on the target device."
