**CVE-2016-5348**

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of size validation in both Java and C++ code when downloading and processing Assisted GPS (XTRA) data files. The Android system downloads XTRA data files automatically when connecting to a new network.  The code uses `Streams.readFully` to read the entire file into memory without checking the file size.  Additionally, the C++ code does not check the size of data being injected into the Qualcomm modem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The code does not validate the size of the downloaded XTRA data file before reading it into memory, leading to potential memory exhaustion.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Both Java and C++ code lack proper input validation on the size of the downloaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker can inject a large XTRA data file, causing memory exhaustion, leading to the device halting and then soft-rebooting.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although RCE was not achieved, the vulnerable code path in the Qualcomm modem or Android OS could potentially be exploited for such attacks, warranting further research.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** A network-level attacker intercepts legitimate requests for XTRA data and injects a manipulated, oversized file instead.
- **Network Proximity:** Attackers can be located on the same network as the vulnerable device, such as on a hostile WiFi hotspot, hacked routers, or along the network backbone.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable device and Qualcomm servers.
- **MITM Capability:** The attacker must be capable of intercepting and modifying network traffic to deliver the malicious XTRA data file.
- **Knowledge of Device Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting this vulnerability may require knowledge of the deviceâ€™s memory limitations to craft an appropriately sized malicious file.
