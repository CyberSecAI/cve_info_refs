  "CVE-2016-5363": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in Neutron anti-spoof protection. By forging DHCP discovery messages or non-IP traffic, such as ARP or ICMPv6, an instance may spoof IP or MAC source addresses on attached networks resulting in denial of services and/or traffic interception. Moreover when L2population isn't used, other tenants attached to a shared network are also vulnerable. Neutron setups using the IPTables firewall driver are affected.",
    "Root cause": "The IPTables firewall rules were too permissive, not enforcing source MAC or IP address restrictions on DHCP discovery messages or non-IP traffic (ARP, ICMPv6).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient source IP/MAC address validation in firewall rules",
      "Overly permissive firewall rules for DHCP and non-IP traffic"
    ],
    "Impact": "An instance can spoof MAC/IP addresses, leading to DoS or traffic interception. On shared networks, other tenants are also vulnerable.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Forging DHCP discovery messages",
      "Forging non-IP traffic like ARP, ICMPv6"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send forged network traffic from an instance within a Neutron managed network.",
		"Affected component": "Neutron IPTables firewall driver"
  }
