  "CVE-2016-5164": {
    "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebKit/Source/platform/v8_inspector/V8Debugger.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the Developer Tools (aka DevTools) subsystem via a crafted web site, aka \"Universal XSS (UXSS).\"",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Blink handles objects from the debugger context when copying them to the inspected context. Specifically, a type confusion issue in V8Debugger.cpp when handling objects during debugging operations, leads to an exploitable condition.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
        "Type confusion"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the Developer Tools (DevTools) subsystem. This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including but not limited to account hijacking, data theft, and defacement of web pages.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, where a remote attacker hosts a crafted web page. A user visiting this page with a vulnerable version of Chrome will trigger the vulnerability.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and trick a victim into visiting it using a vulnerable version of chrome."
