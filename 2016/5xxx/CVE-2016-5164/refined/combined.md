# CVE-2016-5166

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5165.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5167.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5166 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5166)

#### Description

The download implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly restrict saving a file:// URL that is referenced by an http:// URL, which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to discover NetNTLM hashes and conduct SMB relay attacks via a crafted web page that is accessed with the "Save page as" menu choice.

# CVE-2016-5162

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5161.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5163.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5162 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5162)

#### Description

The AllowCrossRendererResourceLoad function in extensions/browser/url\_request\_util.cc in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly use an extension's manifest.json web\_accessible\_resources field for restrictions on IFRAME elements, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks, and trick users into changing extension settings, via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5160.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_31.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, August 31, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 53 to the stable channel - 53.0.2785.89 for Windows, Mac and 53.0.2785.92 for Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks **(Note:** **MSI still points to M52 and will be updated later).**

Chrome 53.0.2785.89 and 53.0.2785.92 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/52.0.2743.116..53.0.2785.92?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 53.
Security Fixes and Rewards
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [33](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M53) security fixes Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[642598](https://crbug.com/642598)] CVE-2016-5167: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c0)  Forgotten User EencPm1bev   2016-03-05 10:03:44 UTC  ``` This package: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:datamaan:branches:home:datamaan/spotify-client](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3Adatamaan%3Abranches%3Ahome%3Adatamaan/spotify-client)  has the 32bit-builds failing with  RPMLINT report: =============== 0 packages and 0 specfiles checked; 0 errors, 2 warnings. Traceback (most recent call last):   File "rpmlint.py", line 385, in <module>   File "rpmlint.py", line 161, in main   File "rpmlint.py", line 220, in runChecks   File "AbstractCheck.py", line 52, in check   File "BinariesCheck.py", line 439, in check_binary   File "BinariesCheck.py", line 237, in __init__   File "Pkg.py", line 130, in getstatusoutput MemoryError   although I already have a _constraints file requiring 4GB of memory. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c1)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-03-05 20:20:15 UTC  ``` I thought, 32bit can only use 3 or 3.5GB - so maybe the 4GB is not really active  or there is some bug in rpmlint making it use excessive amounts of RAM.  I tried to reproduce it locally, but osc build --vm-type=kvm --clean openSUSE_13.2 i586 fails much earlier (probably cannot run 32bit KVM on 64bit host)? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2)  Stefan Brüns   2016-03-06 15:12:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 667925](attachment.cgi?id=667925&action=diff "Lower memory use of objdump output") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=667925&action=edit "Lower memory use of objdump output") Lower memory use of objdump output ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c3)  Stefan Brüns   2016-03-06 15:13:16 UTC  ``` The problem is caused by rpmlints way to check for the pairing of chroot with chdir.  rpmlint uses "objdump -d" and reads the whole output into an internal string buffer. The output for the 100+ MByte libcef.so is ~1 GByte. This output is split into a list of strings, doubling the required size. For me, rpmlint needs about 2.9GByte of memory when checking the spotify package.  The problem can be mitigated by the attached change in rpmlint. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c4)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 08:26:36 UTC  ``` This is affecting now also large packages like libqt5-qtwebkit, and it's preventing their inclusion in Factory. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c5)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-06-29 09:54:13 UTC  ``` I tested the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2) and found that it is not only reversed, but also not working, because getstatusoutput defaults to shell=False and thus does not interpret the "|", but just passes it as a param to objdump.  But it would work with using such a small wrapper script:  #!/bin/sh export LC_ALL=C exec objdump -d "$1" | fgrep call  and then calling ('/path/to/objdumpgrepcall.sh', path)  quick test shows memory saving of factor 20 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c6)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 10:28:31 UTC  ``` Hopefully it should be enough to fix libqt5-qtwebengine or similar packages. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c7)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 13:47:18 UTC  ``` Raising priority as discussed with DimStar on IRC. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c8)  Stefan Brüns   2016-06-29 14:07:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bernhard Wiedemann from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c5)) > I tested the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2) > and found that it is not only reversed, but also not working, > because getstatusoutput defaults to shell=False > and thus does not interpret the "|", but just passes it as a param to > objdump. >  > But it would work with using such a small wrapper script: >  > #!/bin/sh > export LC_ALL=C > exec objdump -d "$1" | fgrep call >  > and then calling ('/path/to/objdumpgrepcall.sh', path) >  > quick test shows memory saving of factor 20  Somehow the wrong file ended up as a patch. See <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint/issues/67> for a working patch. The patch also fixes <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint/issues/66> ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c9)  Stefan Brüns   2016-08-07 15:22:31 UTC  ``` This should be fixed in Factory:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/415832> ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c10)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-03 17:32:22 UTC  ``` We'd need a back-port of this rpmlint fix openSUSE:13.2:Update, where Chromium fails on 32 bits (for [bug 996648](show_bug.cgi?id=996648 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: chromium: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 53.0.2785.89"))  Can you submit this? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c11)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-06 19:54:06 UTC  ``` ping for a 13.2 backport? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c12)  Stefan Brüns   2016-09-06 20:55:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andreas Stieger from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c11)) > ping for a 13.2 backport?  So whom are you asking? ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c13)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-07 08:01:47 UTC  ``` The package maintainer. I am kindly requesting a back-port of this to openSUSE 13.2 maintenance to unblock the Chromium maintenance release on i586. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c14)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-07 12:25:10 UTC  ``` Submitted myself: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/425260> Please handle the review when it comes. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c15)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-09-08 16:00:30 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (969732) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/425726> 13.1 / chromium+rpmlint+rpmlint-mini ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-09-13 11:09:26 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:2296-1: An update that fixes 20 vulnerabilities is now available.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5162.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5164.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5163 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5163)

#### Description

The bidirectional-text implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not ensure left-to-right (LTR) rendering of URLs, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via crafted right-to-left (RTL) Unicode text, related to omnibox/SuggestionView.java and omnibox/UrlBar.java in Chrome for Android.
