RHSA-2018:3768 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2018-12-04
Updated:
2018-12-04
# RHSA-2018:3768 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Fuse 7.2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Fuse.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Fuse enables integration experts, application developers, and business users to collaborate and independently develop connected solutions.

Fuse is part of an agile integration solution. Its distributed approach allows teams to deploy integrated services where required. The API-centric, container-based architecture decouples services so they can be created, extended, and deployed independently.

This release of Red Hat Fuse 7.2 serves as a replacement for Red Hat Fuse 7.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* xmlrpc: Deserialization of untrusted Java object through <ex:serializable> tag (CVE-2016-5003)
* tomcat: A bug in the UTF-8 decoder can lead to DoS (CVE-2018-1336)
* ignite: Improper deserialization allows for code execution via GridClientJdkMarshaller endpoint (CVE-2018-8018)
* apache-cxf: TLS hostname verification does not work correctly with com.sun.net.ssl.\* (CVE-2018-8039)
* xmlrpc: XML external entity vulnerability SSRF via a crafted DTD (CVE-2016-5002)
* undertow: Client can use bogus uri in Digest authentication (CVE-2017-12196)
* spring-data-commons: XXE with Spring Data’s XMLBeam integration (CVE-2018-1259)
* kafka: Users can perform Broker actions via crafted fetch requests, interfering with data replication and causing data lass (CVE-2018-1288)
* tomcat: Insecure defaults in CORS filter enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins (CVE-2018-8014)
* camel-mail: path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2018-8041)
* vertx: Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP response headers (CVE-2018-12537)
* spring-framework: ReDoS Attack with spring-messaging (CVE-2018-1257)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Eedo Shapira (GE Digital) for reporting CVE-2018-8041. The CVE-2017-12196 issue was discovered by Jan Stourac (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1508123#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2017-10-31 20:35:45 UTC  ``` The Apache XML-RPC (aka ws-xmlrpc) library 3.1.3, as used in Apache Archiva, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized Java object in an <ex:serializable> element.   References:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/07/12/5> <https://0ang3el.blogspot.in/2016/07/beware-of-ws-xmlrpc-library-in-your.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1508123#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2017-10-31 20:36:27 UTC  ``` Created xmlrpc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1508124](show_bug.cgi?id=1508124 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5003 xmlrpc: Deserialization of untrusted Java object through <ex:serializable> tag [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1508123#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-05-14 08:25:33 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Setting enabledForExtensions is false by default, thus <ex:serializable> elements are not automatically deserialized.

Subject: Vulnerabilities in Apache Archiva

Hello!

I have recently found three vulnerabilities in ws-xmlrpc library -
<https://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/>. Apache Security Team have assigned three CVE
numbers for Apache Archiva project as it uses ws-xmlrpc library.

Here is the list of vulnerabilities with CVE numbers:

   - CVE-2016-5002 - SSRF attack via loading external DTD in ws-xmlrpc.
   - CVE-2016-5003 - Deserialization of untrusted data via serializable
   data type in ws-xmlrpc.
   - CVE-2016-5004 - DoS attack via Content-Encoding header in ws-xmlrpc.

Technical details regarding vulnerabilities are in this post -
<https://0ang3el.blogspot.ru/2016/07/beware-of-ws-xmlrpc-library-in-your.html>
.

Regards, 0ang3el.
