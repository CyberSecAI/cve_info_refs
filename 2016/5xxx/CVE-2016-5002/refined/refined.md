Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Apache XML-RPC (ws-xmlrpc) library's improper handling of XML external entities (XXE) when processing a crafted Document Type Definition (DTD).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness lies in the library's failure to properly sanitize or restrict the use of external entities defined in a DTD. This allows an attacker to inject malicious external entities into an XML document processed by the library.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Due to the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs defined in the injected DTD.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SSRF Attacks:** An attacker can leverage the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. This could allow them to:
    - Scan internal networks.
    - Access internal services and data.
    - Potentially bypass firewalls or other network security measures.
    - Read local files from the server.
-  **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information could be exposed if the attacker uses SSRF to fetch resources from the internal server or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted DTD:** The attack vector is a malicious XML document containing a crafted DTD that defines external entities that point to URLs controlled by the attacker or to internal resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote as the XML-RPC protocol is typically used over HTTP.
- **Ability to send crafted XML:** The attacker must be able to send an XML-RPC request that contains the crafted DTD.
- **Target application uses XML-RPC:** The target application must use the vulnerable Apache XML-RPC library and be configured to parse XML documents containing a DTD.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `dev-java/xmlrpc` version 3.1.3 and earlier
-  Gentoo has discontinued support for Apache XML-RPC and recommends that users unmerge it.
- Red Hat has addressed the vulnerability in Red Hat Fuse 7.2 through the RHSA-2018:3768 security advisory
