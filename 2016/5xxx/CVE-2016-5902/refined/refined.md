- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in IBM Maximo Asset Management's web interface, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within a trusted user's session. This can lead to altered intended functionality and potential credentials disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the application's web interface. The specific injection method is not detailed, but it is implied that a regular user can do this.
