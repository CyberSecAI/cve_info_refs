```
CVE-2016-5228:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow in the PlayMacro function of the ObjectXMacro.ObjectXMacro ActiveX control (WdMacCtl.ocx).
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability occurs when handling the MacroName argument, allowing an attacker to overwrite the stack.
  - Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a long MacroName argument to the PlayMacro function within the vulnerable ActiveX control.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to cause a vulnerable application (e.g. Internet Explorer) to load and execute the malicious ActiveX control. This usually occurs through a crafted HTML page. The attacker can trigger the overflow remotely by inducing a victim to visit a malicious webpage.

Additional details:
  - The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept HTML page that uses heap spraying to achieve reliable EIP overwrite.
  - The vulnerability is present in Micro Focus Rumba 9.x before 9.3 HF 11997 and 9.4.x before 9.4 HF 12815.
