Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5095:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3602-1) explicitly lists `CVE-2016-5095` as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the `php5` package update.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities are fixed by upgrading to PHP version 5.6.22 and provides links to the changelogs of this and the previous release.
*  The php.net changelog confirms that `CVE-2016-5094` was fixed in version 5.6.22, and the gist provides a diff for the fix, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **integer overflow** in the `php_html_entities` function within PHP. This function is used to convert characters to HTML entities.
*   The vulnerability arises because the length of the generated HTML entities string, which is computed as a `size_t` variable, is then cast to a signed `int` when passed to a function that requires a signed integer length. If the calculated length is greater than `INT_MAX` (the maximum value for a signed integer), this cast can result in a negative value, leading to a heap out-of-bounds read/write when the resulting negative value is used as size.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from the implicit conversion of a `size_t` (unsigned integer) to a signed `int` without a proper bounds check.
*   **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read/Write:** This overflow leads to a negative value being used as the length of a string, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access on the heap when manipulating the string.
*   The gist suggests that there are other code paths, in addition to `php_html_entities` where a similar problem could exist.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation can lead to memory corruption due to the heap out-of-bounds read/write, potentially causing a crash or unpredictable behavior of the application.
*  The additional examples in the bug report, shows that other functions in PHP are affected ( e.g. add\_string\_to\_string, filter )

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Applications:** The vulnerability is likely exploitable through web applications that process user-supplied strings using functions such as `htmlspecialchars`, potentially leading to a denial of service or more severe consequences.
*   **User Input:**  The attack vector involves crafting user input strings with specific patterns that result in the integer overflow in the vulnerable code.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to provide input to a web application that triggers the vulnerable `php_html_entities` or similar functions.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to be in a privileged position on the server. The vulnerability is exploitable through normal web requests.

**7. Additional Details (from Content):**

*   The bug report and the php.net changelog provides more details.
*   The fix involves explicit bounds check `if(len > INT_MAX)` before casting to `int` and handling the out of range condition by returning `NULL` in `php_escape_html_entities_ex`
*   A patch for a similar vulnerability in the filter extension and `add_string_to_string` is also provided in the bug report, with `php_escape_html_entities_ex` also being fixed.
*   The changelog lists this vulnerability as being addressed in PHP versions 5.6.22.
