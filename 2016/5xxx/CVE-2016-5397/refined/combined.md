| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-13 04:32:53 UTC  ``` Improper validation of the file_path argument in t_go_generator.cc:format_go_output() of the Apache Thrift Go client library can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.   The file_path parameter is derived from the service name. If an attacker can provide a service name to a framework invoking Thrift, the attacker could craft the name in a way leading to arbitrary commands being executed.  This affects versions before Apache Thrift 0.10.0.   Upstream Advisory:  <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/thrift-user/201701.mbox/%3CCANyrgvc3W%3DMJ9S-hMZecPNzxkyfgNmuSgVfW2hdDSz5ke%2BOPhQ%40mail.gmail.com%3E>   Upstream Issue:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-3893>   Upstream Commit:  <https://github.com/apache/thrift/commit/2007783e874d524a46b818598a45078448ecc53e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-13 04:33:31 UTC  ``` Created thrift tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1544621](show_bug.cgi?id=1544621 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-5397 thrift: Improper file path sanitization in t_go_generator.cc:format_go_output() of the go client library can allow an attacker to inject commands [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-27 00:45:23 UTC  ``` Marking openshift-enterprise-3 and openshift-1 as not affected. Thrift is available in the rhel-7-server-ose-3.{4-5}-rpms repository, as a dependency of python-elasticsearch. The python-elasticsearch rpm includes Elasticsearch 2.3.0-1. However the elasticsearch hasn't ben required by the thrift libraries since version 1.8.0.   This issue was created to track removal of python-thrift dependency from python-elasticsearch rpm:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560778](show_bug.cgi?id=1560778 "CLOSED DEFERRED - python-elasticsearch spec file requires python-thrift. However it's not used by elasticsearch since version 1.8.0")   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c6)  Kunjan Rathod    2018-04-19 00:46:38 UTC  ``` Marking JON-3 as not affected as the Thrift API's has never been used in Cassandra(Shipped with JON) and hence the Thrift server is disabled.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c9)  Andrej Nemec    2018-05-09 08:02:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  libthrift is a library used by OpenDaylight which is shipped with Red Hat OpenStack. Whilst the version of the library used contains the vulnerable code it is not used by OpenDaylight and hence not exposed.  JBoss fuse 6.3 ships libthrift via insight-activemq fabric-8 profile, however the vulnerable code is not used by fabric-8 so fuse 6.3 is not affected.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-11 07:53:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2018:2669 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2669](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2669)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1544620#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-17 14:54:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8  Via RHSA-2019:3140 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3140](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3140)   ``` |  |

CVE-2016-5397
A security vulnerability was discovered in the Apache Thrift Go client
library,
CVE-2016-5397. It was determined that the Apache Thrift Go client library
exposed
the potential during code generation for command injection due to using an
external formatting tool. This has been traced and resolved in THRIFT-3893
[2].
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: All Apache Thrift versions 0.9.3 and older may be
affected
Mitigation: Upgrading to the latest Apache Thrift 0.10.0 release
Resolution: The issue was resolved by removing the relevant calls to the
external
formatting tool, gofmt, since it is not required for core Apache Thrift code
functionality.

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-05-29 19:28:12 UTC  ``` An issue is present in Apache ZooKeeper 1.0.0 to 3.4.13 and 3.5.0-alpha to 3.5.4-beta. ZooKeeper's getACL() command doesn't check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.   References: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108427> <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1392> <https://zookeeper.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2019-0201>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-05-29 19:28:53 UTC  ``` Created zookeeper tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1715199](show_bug.cgi?id=1715199 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-0201 zookeeper: Information disclosure in Apache ZooKeeper [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c2)  Joshua Padman    2019-08-12 02:26:42 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following product:  * Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6  Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes> for more details.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c3)  Chess Hazlett    2019-08-30 13:24:03 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Use an authentication method other than Digest (e.g. Kerberos) or upgrade to zookeeper 3.4.14 or later (3.5.5 or later if on the 3.5 branch).

#### Description

format\_go\_output runs gofmt on a file\_path which is derived from the service name. If a malicious user is able to provide a service name to a framework invoking thrift, a user-supplied service name could lead to shell command injection.

A potential fix would be to escaping on the file\_path or ensuring that it adheres to a whitelist of characters, e.g. [A-Za-z0-9\_-].

# RHSA-2019:3140 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data spread across physically distinct systems - such as multiple databases, XML files, and even Hadoop systems - appear as a set of tables in a local database.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.7, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* thrift: Improper file path sanitization in t\_go\_generator.cc:format\_go\_output() of the go client library can allow an attacker to inject commands (CVE-2016-5397)
* tika-core: tika: Command injection in tika-server can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted headers (CVE-2018-1335)
* slf4j: Deserialisation vulnerability in EventData constructor can allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-8088)
* jackson-databind: Potential information exfiltration with default typing, serialization gadget from MyBatis (CVE-2018-11307)
* libthrift: thrift: Improper Access Control grants access to files outside the webservers docroot path (CVE-2018-11798)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Jodd-db library (CVE-2018-12022)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Oracle JDBC driver (CVE-2018-12023)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in slf4j-ext class (CVE-2018-14718)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes (CVE-2018-14719)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in axis2-transport-jms class (CVE-2018-19360)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in openjpa class (CVE-2018-19361)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in jboss-common-core class (CVE-2018-19362)
* zookeeper: Information disclosure in Apache ZooKeeper (CVE-2019-0201)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
