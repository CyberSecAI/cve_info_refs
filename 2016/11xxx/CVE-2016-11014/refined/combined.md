# Details

Product Vendor: Netgear

Bug Name: Authentication Bypass in Netgear Router JNR1010 Version 1.0.0.24

Software: Netgear Router JNR1010 Firmware

Version: 1.0.0.24

Last Updated: [10-06-2015](http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29270/~/jnr1010-firmware-version-1.0.0.24)

Homepage: <http://netgear.com/>

Severity High

Status: [Fixed](http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30177/~/jnr1010-firmware-version-1.0.0.32)

POC Video URL: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tET-t-3h7TU>

# Description

This flaw may allow a successful attacker to do anything gaining the privilege of the router being in LAN/WAN.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

**Broken Authentication & Session Management:**

**Authentication Bypass:**

Try Accessing the URL which the normal user have no longer access without credentials with auth token value as “ok” and HTTP Basic Authentication header with password value.

**Improper Session Management:**

Create a fake Session ID and submit the request to the server with the credentials. Whereas, you can see that the session id has no change even after getting logged in and during logout process.

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227973/f9938bd8-b85a-11e5-8763-b19d0250ed81.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227973/f9938bd8-b85a-11e5-8763-b19d0250ed81.png)

**Figure 1:** Session id created by an attacker before login

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227977/ff97fb9a-b85a-11e5-8347-f7c240aa93c4.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227977/ff97fb9a-b85a-11e5-8347-f7c240aa93c4.png)

**Figure 2:** Attacker Session id is not changed even after login

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227998/275f1bea-b85b-11e5-90c7-eecc0d52757b.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227998/275f1bea-b85b-11e5-90c7-eecc0d52757b.png)

**Figure 3:** Session id remains the same even after logging out from the current session.

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228001/2d66acd8-b85b-11e5-92f3-8d9e4bda8806.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228001/2d66acd8-b85b-11e5-92f3-8d9e4bda8806.png)

**Figure 4:** Back button history of the accessed router after logging out

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228007/3634ebd6-b85b-11e5-9c41-5fdcc5d328a9.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228007/3634ebd6-b85b-11e5-9c41-5fdcc5d328a9.png)

**Figure 5:** auth token is set to “ok” once after logging into the router. But, we couldn’t access any pages just by pressing back button after logging out

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228808/35c21f88-b866-11e5-9d14-a3853cc2e35e.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228808/35c21f88-b866-11e5-9d14-a3853cc2e35e.png)

**Figure 6:**Changing the auth token value from “ok” to “nok” and removing extra session tokens will give access to the unauthorized page with the same session id created by an attacker.

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228810/41b842f4-b866-11e5-9f43-13a8cf25ff86.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12228810/41b842f4-b866-11e5-9f43-13a8cf25ff86.png)

**Figure 7:**Authentication logic is bypassed and an attacker can access any pages inside login without credentials

## CVE-2016-11014 – Authentication Bypass in Netgear Router

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/high.png)

Severity:High

#### Vendor

##### NetGear

#### Affected Product

##### JNR1010\_firmware

#### CVE

##### CVE-2016-11014

#### Securin ID

##### 2016-CSW-01-1015

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### October 28, 2018

### Description

An authentication bypass vulnerability was identified on the Netgear JNR1010 devices before 1.0.0.32 which hadÂ incorrect access control because the ok value of the auth cookie is a special case that allows remote attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms via unspecified vectors.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

**Authentication Bypass:** Try Accessing the URL in which the regular user has no longer access without credentials with auth token value as âokâ and HTTP Basic Authentication header with password value.

**Improper Session Management:** Create a fake Session ID and submit the request to the server with the credentials. At the same time, you can see that the session id has no change even after getting logged-in and during the logout process.

***Figure 02:* *Attacker Session id is not changed even after login.***

***Figure 05:* *auth token is set to âokâ once after logging into the router. But we could not access any pages just by pressing the back button after logging out.***

***Figure 06:* *Changing the auth token value from âokâ to ânokâ and removing extra session tokens gives access to the unauthorized page with the same session id created by an attacker.***

***Figure 07:* *Authentication logic is bypassed, and an attacker can access any pages inside login without credentials.***

### Impact

By leveraging this vulnerablitiy, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms via unspecified vectors.

### Remediations

Download the latest version of firmware and update it as per vendor advisory.

### Timeline

**Oct 28, 2015:** Discovered in Netgear Router Firmware Version 1.0.0.24

**Oct 28, 2015:** Reported to vendor

**Nov 03, 2015:** Netgear technical team started addressing the issue after several follow-ups.

**Dec 13, 2015:** Vulnerability was fixed.

**Dec 30, 2015:** The updated Netgear Router JNR1010 version 1.0.0.32 was released.

#Software: Netgear Router JNR1010 Firmware
#Version: 1.0.0.24
#Last Updated: 10-06-2015

#CVE : not assigned
#POC Video URL: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd7Ffy0edYg>

Description
================
Attacker uses leaks or flaws in the authentication or session management
functions (e.g., exposed accounts, passwords, session IDs) to impersonate
users. Developers frequently build custom authentication and session
management schemes, but building these correctly is hard. As a result,
these custom schemes frequently have flaws in areas such as logout,
password management, timeouts, remember me, secret question, account
update, etc.

Technical Details
================
*Authentication Bypass:*

Try Accessing the URL which the normal user have no longer access without
credentials with auth token value as* “ok” *and HTTP Basic Authentication
header with password value

*Improper Session Management:*

Create a fake Session ID and submit the request to the server with the
credentials. Whereas, you can see that the session id has no change even
after getting logged in and during logout process.

For more, also refer -
<https://github.com/cybersecurityworks/Disclosed/issues/14>

Fix
================
Regenerate the session-id of the end user during login and logout process.
Invalidate all the initialized session variables during logout process.
Check for unauthenticated access to all the pages inside login.
Remove Basic HTTP Authentication and Implement any other authentication
technique.
