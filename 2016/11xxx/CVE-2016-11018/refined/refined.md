{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The WordPress plugin 'gallery-images' before version 1.9.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `Client-Ip` and `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
       "Use of untrusted HTTP headers for SQL queries"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion, depending on the database user's permissions. This could compromise the entire WordPress installation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code into the `Client-Ip` or `X-Forwarded-For` headers.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
