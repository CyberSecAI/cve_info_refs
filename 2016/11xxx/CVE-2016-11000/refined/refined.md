Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-11000 (although the content does not explicitly mention this ID, the described vulnerability aligns with it)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `includes/UltimateExportHelper.php` file, specifically within the `createCSVHeaders` function.
- The function constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input (`$exportposttype`) without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `$exportposttype` variable. This variable is directly inserted into the SQL query.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring user authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Data Access:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This enables them to potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, application data, and other confidential information.
- **Data Manipulation/Modification:** An attacker could also modify or delete data within the database, potentially compromising the integrity of the application.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can provide a foothold for further attacks, such as privilege escalation or remote code execution, depending on the database server configuration and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_ultimate_exporter&step=exportposttype`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `export_type_name`, which is sent as a multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server hosting the vulnerable WordPress instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/UltimateExportHelper.php`, line 48:
  ```php
  $header_query1 = "SELECT wp.* FROM  $wpdb->posts wp where post_type = '$post_type'";
  ```
- The `$post_type` variable is directly taken from the `export_type_name` parameter.
- The SQL injection can be triggered by crafting a malicious value for `export_type_name` in the POST request, like `post' AND SLEEP(5) --` to perform time-based blind injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information highlights the vulnerability in versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the `wp-ultimate-exporter` plugin.
- The vendor released version 1.2 to fix the vulnerability (mentioned in the changelog section of the plugin description on wordpress.org)
- The plugin description also mentions a later fix for "Unauthenticated Information Disclosure Vulnerability reported by Wordfence" in version 2.4.1. This is a separate issue but demonstrates that the plugin had other vulnerabilities as well.
-  The wordpress.org plugin page also mentions a "Security issue related to Remote Code Execution." and "Security issue related to Arbitrary File Download Vulnerability" in version 2.9.2 and 2.9.1, respectively. These are later issues but show that the plugin had further vulnerabilities even after this SQLi was addressed.

This information should be helpful in understanding the SQL injection vulnerability in the `wp-ultimate-exporter` plugin.
