- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hard-coded API keys and session IDs within the NETGEAR genie app for Android devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive credentials (API keys and session IDs) due to them being hard-coded in the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can add and delete devices via OpenDNS servers.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the vulnerable NETGEAR genie app for Android devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or access the hard-coded API keys and session IDs, likely through malicious applications or network interception.
