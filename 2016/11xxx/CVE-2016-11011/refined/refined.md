The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the WP-Invoice WordPress plugin, which are not related to a specific CVE.

**Unauthorized Setting Changes**
*   **Root cause:** The `admin_init()` function within `class_core.php` is hooked to the 'admin_init' WordPress action, which is triggered when admin files are loaded, not just for admin users. This function takes user input and directly updates site settings without verification, merging new settings with existing ones.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation and authorization in the `admin_init()` function, allowing unauthorized users to modify plugin settings.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can modify sensitive plugin settings like email templates and payment gateway details (e.g., PayPal email).
*   **Attack vector:** By sending a crafted request with modified settings data to the `admin_init` hook.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires no authentication

**Retrieving Invoices of Arbitrary Users**
*   **Root cause:** AJAX actions for loading invoices are registered for both logged-in and non-logged-in users, but the implementation does not validate the requested user ID when a user is not logged in.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper access control and user ID validation in the AJAX invoice retrieval endpoint for non-logged-in users.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can retrieve invoices belonging to any user by supplying the user ID via the `wpi_user_id` parameter.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted AJAX request with a specified user ID.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires no authentication.

**Updating Previously Invoiced Users Meta Data**
*   **Root cause:** The `wpi_gateway_process_payment` AJAX action allows unauthenticated users to call the `wpi_gateway_base::process_payment()` function. This function processes user-supplied data and updates user metadata through various payment gateway handlers (e.g., 'wpi_paypal', 'wpi_interkassa', 'wpi_twocheckout').
*   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication and input validation in the `wpi_gateway_process_payment` AJAX handler, enabling unauthenticated users to manipulate user metadata.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary user metadata can be updated which could lead to account compromise, if CRM attributes are affected.
*   **Attack vector:** By sending a crafted AJAX request to `wpi_gateway_process_payment` action with manipulated user metadata.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires no authentication.

**Privilege Escalation of Logged-in Users**
*   **Root cause:** The `wpi_update_user_option` AJAX action allows logged-in users to update arbitrary user meta keys and values.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient access control on the `wpi_update_user_option` action, allowing users to modify sensitive options.
*   **Impact:** A logged-in user can escalate their privileges by modifying their `wp_capabilities` or other sensitive fields.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted AJAX request to the `wpi_update_user_option` action.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires a valid WordPress account.
