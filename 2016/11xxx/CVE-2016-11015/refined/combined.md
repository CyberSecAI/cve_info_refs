## CVE-2016-11015 – Cross-Site Request Forgery in Netgear Router

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/high.png)

Severity:High

#### Vendor

##### NetGear

#### Affected Product

##### JNR1010\_firmware

#### CVE

##### CVE-2016-11015

#### Securin ID

##### 2016-CSW-01-1016

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### October 28, 2015

### Description

A Cross-site request forgery vulnerability was identified on NETGEAR JNR1010 devices before 1.0.0.32 allow cgibin/webprocCSRFviathe: InternetGatewayDevice. X\_TWSZCOM\_URL\_Filter.BlackList.1.URL parameter. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

We created a forged request by changing the value of any variable. In **InternetGatewayDevice.X\_TWSZ-COM\_URL\_Filter.BlackList.1** variable in the URL <http://router-ip/cgi-bin/webproc> was sent to the victim by forcing him/her to click on the malicious link generated by an attacker. With different sessions, it allows the attacker to change the settings of the victimâs router.

***Figure 01:* *Blocked site keywords before the CSRF request was sent to the victim.***

***Â ![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/issues-screenshot/ref2.png)***

***Figure 02:* *CSRF Request is created by changing the Blocklist URL variable.***

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/issues-screenshot/ref3.png)Â***

***Figure 03:*** *CSRF request is successfully submitted in the victimâs browser.*

**Note:** Similarly, we can manipulate any request and can force the victim to access the link generated by the attacker to make changes to the router settings without the victimâs knowledge.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.

### Remediations

Download the latest updated firmware and update it as per vendor advisory.

### Timeline

**Oct 28, 2015:** Discovered vulnerability in Netgear Router Firmware Version 1.0.0.24

**Oct 28, 2015:** Reported to vendor.

**Nov 03, 2015:** Netgearâs technical team address the issue after follow-up

**Dec 13, 2015:** Vulnerability got fixed

**Dec 30, 2015:** Updated Netgear Router JNR1010 version 1.0.0.32 was released

**Figure 2:** a CSRF Request is created by changing Block list URL variable

[![csrf-2 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227616/5236d390-b855-11e5-8cac-fdbd1507df4d.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/12227616/5236d390-b855-11e5-8cac-fdbd1507df4d.png)

**Figure 3:** CSRF request is successfully submitted in the victims browser

Note: Similarly, we can manipulate any request and can force victim to access the link generated by the attacker to make changes to the router settings without victim’s knowledge.
