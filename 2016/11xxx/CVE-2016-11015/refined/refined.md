Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-11015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections in the web UI of the Netgear JNR1010 router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The web interface lacks adequate protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to forge requests and execute them in the context of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can manipulate the router's settings by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link.
*   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the logged-in user. This includes potentially changing router settings, such as DNS, firewall rules, and other configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker crafts a malicious link containing a forged request.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker then persuades a user of the Netgear router's web interface to click the link while the user is logged into the router's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet and does not need to be on the local network of the victim.
*   **Knowledge of Target Router:** The attacker needs to know the basic structure of the Netgear router's configuration URLs and parameters.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link.

**Technical Details**

* The vulnerability was found in the URL parameter `InternetGatewayDevice.X_TWSZCOM_URL_Filter.BlackList.1.URL` used in requests to `cgi-bin/webproc`
* By manipulating this parameter an attacker can modify settings on the router.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in Netgear Router JNR1010 Firmware Version 1.0.0.24 and was fixed in version 1.0.0.32.
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit involved changing the "Blocklist URL" variable through a forged request.
*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
