The provided content relates to CVE-2016-11060.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure renegotiation of TLS or SSL connections after the initial handshake.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The affected devices allow a client to renegotiate a remote connection encrypted with TLS or SSL in an insecure manner, after the initial handshake.

**Impact of Exploitation:** This allows for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack using SSL renegotiation. An attacker can potentially exhaust the resources of the device by forcing it to repeatedly renegotiate the secure connection.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the establishment of an initial secure connection via TLS or SSL, followed by insecure renegotiation requests from the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS or SSL connection with the affected device. No specific positional requirements are mentioned besides network accessibility to the vulnerable device.
