## Description

**🏆 The #1 Plugin for User-Generated Content!**

*Enable visitors to submit posts from the front end of your site.*

User Submitted Posts (USP) provides a front-end form that enables visitors to submit posts and upload images. Just add the following shortcode to any Post, Page, or Widget:

[user-submitted-posts]

That’s all there is to it! Your site now can accept user generated content. Everything is super easy to customize via Plugin Settings page.

The post-submission form may include any/all of the following fields:

* Name
* Email
* URL
* Post Title
* Post Tags
* Post Category
* Post Content
* Custom Field 1
* Custom Field 2
* Custom Checkbox
* Challenge Question
* Google reCAPTCHA (v2 or v3)
* Post Images
* Agree to Terms

Each of these fields may be set as required, optional, or disabled. You can set the Post Status of submitted posts as “Pending”, “Draft”, “Publish Immediately”, or publish after a specific number of approved posts.

USP enables users to upload any number of images when submitting a post. You can customize the min/max width, height, and number of submitted images.

USP also includes a Login/Register Form, and three shortcodes to control access and restrict content (more information below).

### ✨ Content Restriction

USP provides three “Access Control” shortcodes to control access and restrict content. Here are some examples to give you an idea of how it works.

Display form and/or content only to users with a specific capability:

```
[usp_access cap="read" deny="Message for users without read capability"]
    [user-submitted-posts] // Put the USP form or any other content here.
[/usp_access]

```

Display form and/or any content to logged-in users:

```
[usp_member deny="Message for users who are not logged in"]
    [user-submitted-posts] // Put the USP form or any other content here.
[/usp_member]

```

Display form and/or any content to visitors only:

```
[usp_visitor deny="Message for users who are logged in"]
    [user-submitted-posts] // Put the USP form or any other content here.
[/usp_visitor]

```

You can add and use Access Control shortcodes on any WP Post or Page. Tip: you can find this information (and more) in the plugin settings, under “Display the Form” > “Access Control”.

## Installation

### How to install the plugin

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and activate
2. Configure your options via the plugin settings
3. Display the form via shortcode or template tag

[More info on installing WP plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins)

### How to use the plugin

To display the form on any WP Post, Page, or widget, add the shortcode:

```
[user-submitted-posts]

```

Or, to display the form anywhere in your theme, add the template tag:

```
<?php if (function_exists('user_submitted_posts')) user_submitted_posts(); ?>

```
### Customizing the form

There are three main ways of customizing the form:

* Plugin settings, you can show/hide fields, configure options, etc.
* Custom form template (see “Custom Submission Form” for more info)
* By using USP action/filter hooks (advanced)

USP Hooks:

```
Filters:
usp_post_status
usp_post_author
usp_form_shortcode
usp_mail_subject
usp_mail_message
usp_new_post
usp_input_validate
usp_require_login
usp_default_title

Actions:
usp_submit_success
usp_submit_error
usp_insert_before
usp_insert_after
usp_files_before
usp_files_after

```

Check out the [complete list of action hooks for User Submitted Posts](https://perishablepress.com/action-filter-hooks-user-submitted-posts/)

More info about [WordPress Actions and Filters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API#Hooks.2C_Actions_and_Filters)

### Custom Submission Form

Out of the box, User Submitted Posts provides a highly configurable submission form. Simply visit the plugin settings to control which fields are displayed, set the Challenge Question, configure submitted images, and much more.

There are situations, however, where advanced form configuration may be required. In order to allow for this, USP makes it possible to create a custom submission form. Here are the steps:

First, copy these two plugin files:

```
/user-submitted-posts/resources/usp.css
/user-submitted-posts/views/submission-form.php

```

Then, paste those two files into a directory named `/usp/` in your theme:

```
/wp-content/themes/your-theme/usp/usp.css
/wp-content/themes/your-theme/usp/submission-form.php

```

Lastly, visit the plugin settings and change “Form style” to “Custom Form + CSS”. You now may customize the two files as desired; they will not be overwritten when the plugin is updated. For help with making basic changes to the custom form, check out the [USP FAQs](https://perishablepress.com/faqs-user-submitted-posts/#customize-form) at Perishable Press.

Alternately, you can set the option “Form style” to “HTML5 Form + Disable CSS” to use the default USP form along with your own CSS. FYI: here is a list of [USP CSS selectors](https://m0n.co/e).

Or, to go further with unlimited custom forms, [check out USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/) 🙂

### Displaying submitted posts

User-submitted posts are handled by WordPress as regular WP Posts. So they are displayed along with your other posts according to your theme design. Additionally, each submitted post includes a set of Custom Fields that include the following information:

* `is_submission` – indicates that the post is a user-submitted post
* `user_submit_image` – the URL of the submitted image (one custom field per image)
* `user_submit_ip` – the IP address of the submitted-post author
* `user_submit_name` – the name of the submitted-post author
* `user_submit_url` – the submitted URL
* `usp_custom_field` – configurable Custom Field

There are numerous ways to display these Custom Fields. The easiest way is to visit the plugin settings and configure the options available under “Auto-Display Content”. There you can enable auto-display of submitted email address, URL, and images. Note that submitted images also are uploaded to the WP Media Library.

For more flexibility, you can use a variety of WP Template Tags (e.g., [get\_post\_meta()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta)) to display Custom Fields. Here are some tutorials for more information:

* [WordPress Custom Fields, Part I: The Basics](https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tutorial/)
* [WordPress Custom Fields, Part II: Tips and Tricks](https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tips-tricks/)

And here are some tutorials that may help with custom display of submitted images:

* [Display all images attached to post](https://wp-mix.com/display-images-attached-post/)
* [Display images with links](https://wp-mix.com/display-images-with-user-submitted-posts/)

Also, here is a [Helper Plugin to display Custom Fields](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-custom-field-helper-plugin/). It originally is designed for use with USP Pro, but also works great with the free version of USP.

### Auto Display Images

To automatically display submitted images on the front end, visit the plugin settings, “Images Auto-Display” and select whether to display the images before or after post content. Save changes.

### Featured Images

To set submitted images as Featured Images (aka Post Thumbnails) for submitted posts, visit the plugin settings, “Image Uploads” and check the box to enable “Featured Image”. Save changes.

### Shortcodes

User Submitted Posts provides a set of useful shortcodes. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more information.

```
[user-submitted-posts]                        : displays the form on any Post or Page
[usp-login-form]                              : displays a login/register/password form
[usp_display_posts]                           : displays list of all submitted posts
[usp_gallery]                                 : displays a gallery of all submitted images for the current post
[usp-reset-button url="https://example.com/"] : displays a button to reset the form
[usp_access cap="read" deny=""][/usp_access]  : limits access to specific user capability
[usp_visitor deny=""][/usp_visitor]           : limits access to visitors (not logged in) only
[usp_member deny=""][/usp_member]             : limits access to logged-in users

```

Here is more info about these shortcodes:

**`[user-submitted-posts]`**

Displays the post-submit form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.

**`[usp-login-form]`**

Displays the login/register/password form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.

To add Google reCaptcha to the form, you can use any good reCaptcha plugin. Here are a few examples:

* [reCAPTCHA Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recaptcha-lite/)
* [Smart Captcha (reCAPTCHA)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-recaptcha/)
* [reCaptcha by BestWebSoft](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-captcha/)

These are not endorsements for these plugins. They have been tested and work with the USP login/register/password form.

**`[usp_display_posts]`**

Displays a list of all submitted posts. This shortcode accepts two optional attributes, “userid” and “numposts”. Examples:

```
[usp_display_posts]                           : default displays all submitted posts by all authors
[usp_display_posts userid="current"]          : displays all submitted posts by current logged-in user
[usp_display_posts userid="1"]                : displays all submitted posts by registered user with ID = 1
[usp_display_posts userid="Pat Smith"]        : displays all submitted posts by author name "Pat Smith"
[usp_display_posts userid="all"]              : displays all submitted posts by all users/authors
[usp_display_posts userid="all" numposts="5"] : limit to 5 posts from all users
[usp_display_posts post_type="page"]          : display only submitted pages

```

So the shortcode attributes can be used to customize the post list as desired. Note that the Pro version of USP provides many more options for the [display-posts shortcode](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-display-list-submitted-posts/).

**`[usp_gallery]`**

**Note:** This shortcode works only when added to a submitted post. It does nothing when added anywhere else.

Displays a gallery of all submitted images for the current post. Customize via the following attributes:

```
size    = image size as thumbnail, medium, large or full -> default = thumbnail
format  = whether to make the image a linked image       -> default = image (can use image or image_link)
target  = whether to open linked image in new tab        -> default = blank (can use blank or self)
class   = optional custom class name(s)                  -> default = none
number  = the number of images to display for each post  -> default = 100
post_id = an optional post ID to use                     -> default = false (uses global/current post)

Check out the source code inline notes for more info

```

**`[usp-reset-button]`**

Displays a button to reset the form. Accepts the following attributes:

```
class  = classes for the parent element (optional, default: none)
value  = link text (optional, default: "Reset form")
url    = the URL where your form is displayed (required, default: none)
custom = any attributes or custom code for the link element (optional, default: none)

```

Note that the `url` attribute accepts `%%current%%` for the current URL (useful when the form is displayed in the sidebar).

**`[usp_access]`**

Limits access to specific user capability. Example:

```
[usp_access cap="read"]
    Content for users that have "read" access
[/usp_access]

```

The `cap` attribute specifies the required capability or capabilities (comma-separated). This shortcode also accepts an optional `deny` attribute. The `deny` attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use `{tag}` to display `<tag>`. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.

**`[usp_visitor]`**

Limits access to visitors (not logged in) only. Example:

```
[usp_visitor]
    Content for for users who are not logged in
[/usp_visitor]

```

This shortcode accepts an optional `deny` attribute. The `deny` attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use `{tag}` to display `<tag>`. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.

**`[usp_member]`**

Limits access to logged-in users. Example:

```
[usp_member]
    Content for for users who are logged in
[/usp_member]

```

This shortcode accepts an optional `deny` attribute. The `deny` attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use `{tag}` to display `<tag>`. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.

            $class   = optional custom class name(s)                  -> default = none

*/

usp_get_images()

```

These template tags should work out of the box when included in your theme template file(s). Keep in mind that for some of the tags to work, there must be some existing submitted posts and/or images available.

The source code for these tags is located in `/library/template-tags.php` and `shortcode-login.php`.

### Upgrades

To upgrade User Submitted Posts, remove the old version and replace with the new version. Or just click “Update” from the Plugins screen and let WordPress do it for you automatically.

**Important!** The `/custom/` directory is deprecated. If you are using a custom form template, please move it to `/wp-content/your-theme/usp/`. For more information, check out the “Custom Submission Form” section under [Installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/#installation).

**Note:** uninstalling the plugin from the WP Plugins screen results in the removal of all settings from the WP database. Submitted posts are NOT removed if you deactivate the plugin, reset default options, or uninstall the plugins; that is, all submitted posts must be removed manually.

### Restore Default Options

To restore default plugin options, either uninstall/reinstall the plugin, or visit the plugin settings > Restore Default Options.

### Uninstalling

User Submitted Posts cleans up after itself. All plugin settings will be removed from your database when the plugin is uninstalled via the Plugins screen. Submitted posts are NOT removed if you deactivate the plugin, reset default options, or uninstall the plugins; that is, *all submitted posts must be removed manually*.

### Pro Version

Pro version of USP now available! USP Pro includes many more awesome features and settings, with unlimited custom forms, infinite custom fields, multimedia file uploads, and much, much more.

## FAQ

### Can you add this feature or that feature?

Please check the [Pro version of USP](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/), which includes many of the most commonly requested features from users. The free version also may include new features in future updates.

### Images are not uploaded or displaying

If everything is configured properly, USP will display submitted images on the front-end. If that is not happening, here are some things to check:

* Make sure that the setting “Images Auto-Display” is enabled
* And/or make sure that the setting “Featured Image” is enabled
* And/or make sure that your theme is set up to display submitted images

Assuming that everything is set up to display submitted images, here are some further things to check:

* Is there any error message when trying to submit an image?
* Check that the submitted images are uploaded to the Media Library
* Check that the URL of the submitted image is attached to the submitted post as a Custom Field (on Edit Post screen)
* Check the permission settings on the upload folder(s) by ensuring that you can successfully upload image files directly via the Media Uploader
* Double-check that all the “Image Uploads” settings make sense, and that the images being uploaded meet the specified requirements

Note: when changing permissions on files and folders, it is important to use the least-restrictive settings possible. If you have to use more permissive settings, it is important to secure the directory against malicious activity. For more information check out: [Secure Media Uploads](https://digwp.com/2012/09/secure-media-uploads/)

### How to set submitted image as the featured image?

Here are the steps:

1. Visit USP settings > Options panel > Image Uploads > Featured Image
2. Check the box and click “Save Settings” to save your changes

Note that this setting merely assigns the submitted image as the Featured Image; it’s up to your theme’s single.php file to include `the_post_thumbnail()` to display the Featured Images. If your theme is not so equipped, [check out this tutorial at WP-Mix](https://wp-mix.com/set-attachment-featured-image/).

### How to require login?

Visit the plugin settings and enable the option to “Require User Login”. That will display the submission form only to logged-in users. To go further and require login for other types of content, there are many techniques available to you. For more information check out my WP-Mix post, [WordPress Require User Login](https://wp-mix.com/wordpress-require-user-login/), which provides a good summary of the possibilities. Also note: [USP Pro includes built-in shortcodes](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-display-form-logged-in-users/) to display forms and other content to registered/logged-in users and/or guests/logged-out users.

### How do I change the appearance of the submission form?

The easiest way to customize the form is via the plugin settings. There you can choose one of the following form configurations:

* HTML5 Form + Default CSS (Recommended)
* HTML5 Form + Disable CSS (Provide your own styles)
* Custom Form + Custom CSS (Provide your own form template & styles)

Additionally, you can configure the settings to show/hide specific fields, control the number and size of submitted images, customize the Challenge Question, and much more.

To go beyond what’s possible with the plugin settings, USP enables creation of a custom submission form. To learn how, check out the “Custom Submission Form” section under [Installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/installation/). And for advanced customization, developers can use [USP action and filter hooks](https://perishablepress.com/action-filter-hooks-user-submitted-posts/).

Or, to go further with unlimited custom forms, [check out USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/) 🙂

### What is the “alternate” form?

Inside of the `/views/` directory, you will find an alternate form template named `submission-form-alt.php`. This template is identical to that used for the default form, with the exception that it returns the post-submit form in addition to the success message. You can use the alternate form template by following the steps provided via the “Custom Submission Form” section of the plugin documentation/readme.

### What about security and spam?

User Submitted Posts uses the WordPress API to keep everything secure, fast, and flexible. The plugin also features Google reCAPTCHA, Challenge Question, and hidden anti-spam field to stop automated spam and bad bots.

### Can I include video?

The free version of USP supports uploads of images only, but some hosted videos may be included in the submitted content (textarea) by simply including the video URL on its own line. See [this page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) for more info. Note that [USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/) enables users to [upload video and much more](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-allowed-file-types/#file-formats).

### How do I reset the plugin settings?

To reset plugin settings to factory defaults:

1. Visit “Restore Default Options” in the plugin settings
2. Check the box and save your changes
3. Deactivate the plugin and then reactivate it
4. Plugin settings now are restored to defaults

Restoring default settings does not delete any submitted posts. Even if you completely remove the plugin, the submitted posts will not be deleted. You have to remove them manually, if desired.

### How do I enable the “Add Media” button for all users?

Question: How do I enable the “Add Media” button for all users (even if not registered)?

Answer: Users must have sufficient capabilities to access the Media Library and the “Add Media” button. This is a security measure aimed at preventing foul play. The Pro version of USP provides an option to [enable Add Media uploads for all user levels](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-enable-non-admin-users-upload-media/).

### Can you explain the setting “Registered Username”?

When “Registered Username” is enabled:

* If the user is logged in, their registered username is used as the Post Author
* If the user is logged out, the setting “Assigned Author” is used as the Post Author

When “Registered Username” is disabled:

* The setting “Assigned Author” always is used as the Post Author for all users (whether logged in or not)

### How can I translate this plugin?

Currently the easiest and most flexible method is to [use GlotPress to translate USP](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/user-submitted-posts). That is the recommended translation route going forward, but for the time being you may also translate using a plugin such as [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/). FYI, USP’s translation files are located in the `/languages/` directory.

### Why am I not receiving the Email Alerts?

Normally the plugin sends an Email Alert each time a post is submitted. If that is not happening in your case, you will need to troubleshoot your setup. Here is a guide on [Troubleshooting Email](https://perishablepress.com/email-troubleshooting-guide/) that should help.

### How to disable image preview feature?

To disable the image-preview thumbnail feature, add the following line to the plugin setting, “Custom Content”:

```
<script>var usp_disable_previews = true;</script>

```

Save changes and done.

### How to disable fancy category/tag select script?

USP uses the Chosen.js library to enhance the behavior and appearance of the Category and Tag fields. The enhanced fields will be displayed when either/both of the following are true:

* The option “Multiple Categories” is enabled (for Category field)
* The option “Use Existing Tags” is enabled (for Tag field)

If you want to disable the fancy Chosen script for these fields, you can do so by adding the following code snippet to your WordPress site:

```
<script>var usp_disable_chosen = true;</script>

```

Save changes and done. Also just FYI, here is a guide that explains [how to add custom code to WordPress](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/).

### How to change the language for Google reCaptcha?

By default, the Google reCaptcha field is displayed in English. To change that to some other language, first locate the two-digit abbreviation for your language [here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/language). Then add the following code to your theme (or child theme) functions.php, or add via [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/):

```
function usp_recaptcha_querystring($query) { return 'en'; }
add_filter('usp_recaptcha_querystring', 'usp_recaptcha_querystring');

```

Notice where it says `en`, that is the two-character language code you want to replace with your own. Then save changes and done.

### Where can I check out a demo of the USP form?

There is a simplified [USP Demo](https://perishablepress.com/wp/wp-content/online/pages/user-submitted-posts-demo.html) at Perishable Press. Note the demo form is non-functional, just there to give you a general idea. The actual form provided by the plugin has more features, functionality, etc.

### How to allow blank targets in post content?

By default, USP removes any `target="_blank"` attributes in submitted post content. This is a recommended security feature. It is possible however to allow blank targets:

```
function usp_content_patterns($array) { return array(); }
add_filter('usp_content_patterns', 'usp_content_patterns');

```

That code can be added via theme (or child theme) functions.php, or add via [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/).

### How to disable all HTML tags in submitted posts?

Add the code snippet provided [here](https://perishablepress.com/faqs-user-submitted-posts/#allowed-tags).

### How does the remote delete post link work?

When `%%delete_link%%` is included in your email alert template, a link will be included that the user can click to delete their submitted post. This works when the user who submitted the post is logged in to WordPress. It does not work for users who are not logged in, or are not the post author. For more details and tips, check out the [USP FAQs](https://perishablepress.com/faqs-user-submitted-posts/#delete-post-message) at Perishable Press.

### How to remove placeholder text on submission form?

You can either enable the custom form and modify the output/HTML directly, or you can just add the following to the plugin’s “Custom Content” option:

```
<script>jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
    $('.usp-title label').text('This is the label');
    $('.usp-title input').attr('placeholder', 'This is the placeholder');
});</script>

```

Change the two text strings, “This is the label” and “This is the placeholder” to whatever you would like. Then save changes and done.

Add the ability to limit image uploads to KB, limit the length of the title by the number of characters and the length of the text by the number of characters (not words), and I promise to donate!
