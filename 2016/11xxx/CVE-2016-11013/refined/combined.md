This is a very nice free plug-in for real estate listings. I just wish there were more choices for the templates. The best one is the default template.

////////////WP v5.2.3, Impress Listings plugin v2.4.0////////////
Design is ugh, permanent links are not working, conflict with contactForm7 plugin, not working for sales & marketing plan.
This plugin has enough input fields a realtor needs; but that’s pretty easy, just input and output. The main point is that when we need to sell multi-million-dollar homes, their front-end design looks kind of cheasy, even the paid templates. Photos are too small, no zoom, no popup when clicked, details in the table are not displayed consistently. I think this probably caused by default theme in my system. I think that this plugin was built in rush so that it’ll work with the IDX back-end but they don’t give front-end enough care. My opinion is that the free single-page design should be custom designed with PRO look and feel, instead of re-using the WP installed theme.
I’d like my potential visitors scan a QR Code on my home-for-sales sign, but I really don’t want to redirect to my listing page because it doesn’t look professional for a 2-mil-dollar home. I’ll need to build a custom page that looks more attractive, but I have to manually retype all the details, data, and upload photos again. So this plugin is just a waste for a realtor’s marketing plan. It’s good if you just need to type some details and show on a page but it’s not professional if you really want to sell an expensive home.

Plugin hasn’t been updated in 8 months. Description, details, photos, etc, used to be tabs that you could selected from a horizontal list and now they’re vertically listed links, which is pointless because all of the information is displayed on the page if you keep scrolling anyway. Looks even worse on mobile.

Why would anyone buy the author’s paid plugins if their free ones do not work?
As of Dec 2017, this plugin hasn’t been updated in 6 months and it shows. My development website is not functional. They have also seemingly stopped responding to support questions.

The shortcode is useless. Does not work the way it should. Not intuitive. I really really like everything else about this plugin, but I need shortcodes to work so this is getting deleted.

### @sourcekris **[sourcekris](/sourcekris)** commented [Jan 27, 2016](#issue-129122176)

While researching security vulnerabilities also discovered a bug where the contact form for a listing doesn't display if wp\_listings\_default\_form exists but is null.

Reflective XSS is in a post request, still an issue but low impact. Fixed with wp built in esc\_html().
