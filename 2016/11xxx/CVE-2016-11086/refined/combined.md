## Description

[![@koenrh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307291?u=1ae9143d0898691f84646f06adeef1df28083e5c&v=4&size=48)](/koenrh)[koenrh](https://github.com/koenrh)opened [on Dec 1, 2016](https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth-ruby/issues/137#issue-192974378)

While analysing the source code of some third party libraries we use in our projects, I found an issue with the way certificate validation is handled in this library. If the certificate bundle cannot be found on the file system at three known/specified locations, then it silently falls back to a mode (i.e. `OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE`) in which the certificate and the certificate chain aren't validated at all.

See the following code fragments copied from `lib/oauth/consumer.rb`.

If the environment variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` is not set, and no file can be found in the three specified locations, then `CA_FILE` is assigned `nil`. If you then look at the second code fragment, you can see that `verify_mode` will be set to `VERIFY_NONE` if `CA_FILE` equals `nil` and if the user hasn't explicitly set `ca_file` in the `options` object.

Lines [11-18](https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth-ruby/blob/e397b3e2f540faaebd7912aeb2768835d151f795/lib/oauth/consumer.rb#L11-L18):

```
# determine the certificate authority path to verify SSL certs
CA_FILES = %W(#{ENV['SSL_CERT_FILE']} /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /usr/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt)
CA_FILES.each do |ca_file|
  if File.exist?(ca_file)
    CA_FILE = ca_file
    break
  end
end
CA_FILE = nil unless defined?(CA_FILE)
```

Lines [333-339](https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth-ruby/blob/e397b3e2f540faaebd7912aeb2768835d151f795/lib/oauth/consumer.rb#L333-L339):

```
if @options[:ca_file] || CA_FILE
  http_object.ca_file = @options[:ca_file] || CA_FILE
  http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER
  http_object.verify_depth = 5
else
  http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE
end
```

I would expect a library to fail hard (i.e. throw an exception) in this case, and not silently fall back to an insecure mode. Also, it might be a good idea to embed a certificate bundle (e.g. <https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem>) in the library itself. If no system certificate bundle can be found, then you could always fall back to the embedded certificate bundle.

Let me know if you do have questions.
