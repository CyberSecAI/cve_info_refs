The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the WP-Invoice WordPress plugin, but it does not directly correlate to a specific CVE ID as it outlines several issues rather than a single one. Therefore, it is not possible to directly relate this content to CVE-2016-11008. However, the information below outlines the vulnerabilities discussed:

**1. Unauthorized Setting Changes:**

*   **Root cause:** The `admin_init()` function, hooked to the `admin_init` WordPress action, processes user input without verification, allowing settings to be updated.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper input validation, insecure handling of user input
*   **Impact:** Unauthenticated users can modify critical plugin settings, including email templates and PayPal email addresses.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending crafted requests to the `admin_init` action
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Unauthenticated access

**2. Retrieving invoices of arbitrary users:**

*   **Root cause:** AJAX actions allow loading invoices, with a user ID taken from the `$_GET['wpi_user_id']` parameter if not logged in.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper authorization checks
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive invoice data.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending crafted AJAX requests to load invoices for other users using a numerical user ID.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Unauthenticated access

**3. Updating previously invoiced users meta data:**

*   **Root cause:** Unauthenticated AJAX access to `wpi_gateway_process_payment` allows modifying user meta data.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure AJAX handling
*   **Impact:** Modification of user metadata, including CRM data.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending crafted AJAX requests to the `wpi_gateway_process_payment` action, using payment gateways like PayPal, Interkassa, and Twocheckout.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Unauthenticated access

**4. Privilege escalation of logged in users:**

*   **Root cause:** The `wpi_update_user_option` AJAX action allows logged-in users to modify their account meta data using arbitrary keys and values.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient access control
*   **Impact:** Users can modify their roles and permissions, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending crafted AJAX requests to the `wpi_update_user_option` action.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Authenticated access

Based on this breakdown, the content is relevant to multiple vulnerabilities in the WP-Invoice plugin, but since these are multiple distinct issues, it cannot be associated with a singular CVE.
