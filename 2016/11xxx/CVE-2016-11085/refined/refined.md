The provided content describes a CSRF and stored XSS vulnerability in the Quiz And Survey Master WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of a CSRF vulnerability allowing unauthenticated users to add questions to a quiz and how the plugin handles user-provided input for question names. Specifically, while the plugin attempts to escape the `question_name` parameter with `esc_js()` when constructing a JavaScript object, the subsequent handling of this data in `js/admin_question.js` via jQuery's `html()` and `text()` methods bypasses this escaping. This leads to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** An unauthenticated attacker can add questions to existing quizzes via a crafted request.
2.  **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** User-provided input (the `question_name` parameter), which includes HTML tags is stored and later rendered without proper sanitization in the javascript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser when they view the quiz admin page. This could allow an attacker to take control of the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious form submission containing the XSS payload within the `question_name` parameter. This form can be submitted by an unauthenticated user, exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The stored XSS payload is executed when an administrator views the quiz page where questions are displayed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They require the ability to submit HTTP requests to the target site (i.e., any user can access the form submission).
*   The attacker needs to know the `quiz_id`.
