R16-05 SPAR Release
073.xxx.086.15410

Release Date: June 27, 2016  Update: October 27, 2016                                                                                                                                                                Version 1.1

Purpose

This Bulletin is intended ONLY for the specific security problem identified below. The problem identified has been rated a
criticality level of IMPORTANT. This SPAR release uses OpenSSL version 1.0.2f.

Includes fixes for:
  Disabling TLS 1.0 security protocol embedded HTTPS server only. Note that TLS 1.0 is enabled by default on these

devices.

  Unsafe File-Directory Permissions

  An OS Command Injection found in the configrui.php file.

  CVE-2015-7547. Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the (1) send_dg and (2) send_vc functions in the libresolv

library in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.23 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response.

  CVE-2014-9425, CVE-2014-9426, CVE-2015-7803, CVE-2015-7804, CVE-2015-5590, CVE-2015-6831, CVE-2015-

6832, CVE-2015-6836. Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP (e.g., Double free vulnerability in the
zend_ts_hash_graceful_destroy function in zend_ts_hash.c in the Zend Engine in PHP allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors) require an upgrade to
PHP.

  CVE-2015-5312, CVE-2015-7497, CVE-2015-7498, CVE-2015-7499, CVE-2015-7500, CVE-2015-8241, CVE-2015-

8242, CVE-2015-8317. Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 (e.g., Heap-based buffer overflow in the
xmlDictComputeFastQKey function in dict.c in libxml2 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service via unspecified vectors) requires an upgrade to libxml2 version 2.9.3 or greater.

  CVE-2016-0701, CVE-2015-3194, CVE-2015-3195, CVE-2016-0701. Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (e.g., The

DH_check_pub_key function in crypto/dh/dh_check.c in OpenSSL does not ensure that prime numbers are
appropriate for Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover a private DH
exponent by making multiple handshakes with a peer that chose an inappropriate number) requires an upgrade to
PenSSL 1.0.2f.

  CVE-2015-5296. Samba supports connections that are encrypted but unsigned, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to conduct encrypted-to-unencrypted downgrade attacks by modifying the client-server data string.

General Information
Upgrading to 073 release
The recommended method is to use the Automatic Upgrade tool, also known as Software Upgrade Utility

Automatic Upgrade Utility Error Messages
“A connection with the device has been lost. Restart the device and select continue…”. Check if PDL Switching is enabled
on the Raw TCP/IP port (port 9100). By default, PDL Switching is disabled. To use the tool, disable PDL switching. After
the upgrade, enable PDL
switching again. This will be fixed in a future SW Upgrade Tool version.

To disabled/enable PDL Switching: Go to the device web page, Properties>Connectivity>Setup>Raw TCP/IP
Printing>Select Edit. If PDL Switching is enabled, select the box to remove the check mark. Select Apply.

A message “No supported device found using IP # or Hostname. Enter a valid IP address or hostname and try again.”
Check if the device is using HTTPS. If it is, ensure you select the “Enable HTTPS” option on the software upgrade utility.

If you call support for an issue using the upgrade utility, ensure you provide the CKToolUpgradexxx.log file that coincides
with the issue. This log file is located in the folder where you launched the tool.
