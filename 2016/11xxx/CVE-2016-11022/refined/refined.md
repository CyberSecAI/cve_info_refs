{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `do_login` function within the `common.php` module. Specifically, the `system()` PHP call to `/wnc/bin/json_cli` constructs a command line through unsanitized string concatenation of user-controlled input from the `$_POST` request. The `reqMethod` parameter is directly injected into the command line.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Pre-authentication Remote Command Injection (RCI)",
      "Unsanitized input leading to OS Command Injection",
      "Direct use of user-supplied data in a system call",
       "Lack of proper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the web server user, effectively gaining root access on the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/login_handler.php` endpoint, injecting malicious commands through the `reqMethod` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to ping the device, access its web interface, and send a POST request. No prior authentication is required."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Netgear ProSAFE WC9500",
    "Netgear ProSafe WC7600",
    "Netgear ProSafe WC7520"
  ],
  "poc_details": "The provided PoC demonstrates the injection of the command 'cat /etc/passwd' via the reqMethod parameter in the POST request:\n\n```\ncurl --data 'reqMethod=json_cli_reqMethod\" \"json_cli_jsonData\"; cat \"/etc/passwd\"' http://[target]/login_handler.php\n```",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was discovered in the latest firmware of each product as of October 16, 2015. The issue can be exploited through both wired and wireless connections, provided the attacker can reach the device's web interface. The vulnerability is present by default and there is no known configuration change to prevent exploitation."
