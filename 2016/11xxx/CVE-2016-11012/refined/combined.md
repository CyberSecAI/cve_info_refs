## FAQ

How does the plugin work?

When activated, the plugin automatically creates a “Submit Ticket” page where users can submit support tickets. Once a support ticket has been submitted, you will be notified via an email. To view the support ticket, log in to your wordpress admin section, click on “Support Tickets” in the left navigation and then click on “Edit”. At the top right, you should notice options to change your support ticket status as well as assign a ticket priority. Notifications are sent out when there is a new support ticket as well as when there are new support ticket responses – these can be changed in the settings page.

How do I edit the Submit Ticket page?

The Submit Ticket page is created automatically upon activation. To edit, please go to Pages in your left navigation and edit the relevant page. Please remember to keep the shortcode on the page so that the submit ticket form shows correctly.

How do I add a support desk / help desk to my website?

In the basic version of the plugin, only a “Submit ticket” page is created. Should you wish to add a fully customizable help desk to your front end that shows public open/closed tickets and a search feature, please consider purchasing the premium version of the plugin for only $29.99 / year. Updates included forever.

I understand that you guys want to upsell your premium version.
But you have stripped the free version so badly that it doesn’t even work.
I install, test submitting a ticket, and get a page not found error because you have disabled the front end ticket list system for users, but seem to have forgotten to provide an end point for the basic version’s submission system.
Terrible – uninstalled and rated poorly.

Aucun interêt de prendre le plugin free.
Ne marche tout simplement pas, impossible de modifier le statut “en attente de validation”.
Tout est fait pour prendre l’abonnement mensuel à “à dollard / an

For the premium add-on, the Email Retrieval does not work. I have already tried contacting the plugin creator, whom took several weeks of running me around in circles just to say “contact your host”. The support for this plugin is subpar/non-existent. Find a plugin where they actually help you get their product to work properly, as paid for. Also, recently they completely changed the backend layout for the plugin, which has taken away a lot of different aspects over which the backend user previously had control. Don’t like it.

Hi there, I need to use the front/back end in Spanish. How can I achieve that? I bought the plugin and submitted a ticket 2 weeks ago but I did not receive responses. J.

I had tried this plugin a few months back but ended up going with a plugin that integrates osTicket. I decided to try it again as I would really prefer a helpdesk that’s native to WordPress.
I created a sample ticket. After creation it took me to:
www.mysite.com/support-tickets/hello-world-2/
Hello World was the subject of the support ticket. All I ended up getting was an error from WordPress telling me that this page doesn’t exist. I went to the Admin side of WordPress. I noticed that the ticket was created. I clicked to view the ticket. Once again, the same error that the page or post wasn’t found. I also noticed that there was a ticket that I had created during the first install. It seems as if the plugin does a poor job of cleaning up when you uninstall it.
Another issue is that it seems as if all the plugin is doing is creating a post. I was hoping for a system where you can actually reply to tickets like a normal helpdesk.
This plugin is too buggy. I had only tried the free version. If it actually worked properly, I would have no issues with paying for a premium version. Unfortunately, there’s much work to be done before I could consider this to be stable enough for use on a live site. After uninstalling, I’ll have to comb through my database using phpMyAdmin for any orphan tables. I have a feeling I’ll be having to manually clean up behind this plugin.
