Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack overflow vulnerability present in the NCP dissector within Wireshark. Specifically, the `dissect_ncp_request` function is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow in `dissect_ncp_request` function. This indicates a flaw in how the function handles incoming data, likely due to insufficient bounds checking or allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the Wireshark application.
- The crash is due to the stack overflow, which can overwrite critical data on the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Packet on the Wire:** Injecting a specifically crafted malicious NCP packet onto the network being monitored.
- **Malformed Packet Trace File:** Convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file containing a malformed NCP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic or provide a malicious capture file to a user running a vulnerable version of Wireshark.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the machine running Wireshark.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability to create malformed NCP packets for successful exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Chris Benedict and a test case was generated using AFL 1.96b.
- The affected versions of Wireshark are 1.12.0 to 1.12.10 and it is fixed in version 1.12.11.
- The vulnerability exists within the dissection engine library (libwireshark) which is a core component of Wireshark.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium) according to Oracle, however other sources do not provide a CVSS score.
