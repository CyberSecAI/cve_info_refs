Guideline 1: Verified - This content relates to CVE-2016-4580 based on its description.

Guideline 4: Extracted details

Root cause of vulnerability:
The `x25_negotiate_facilities` function in net/x25/x25_facilities.c does not properly initialize a data structure before copying it to userland.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Kernel information leak due to uninitialized stack memory.

Impact of exploitation:
A local attacker can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

Attack vectors:
By triggering the x25_negotiate_facilities function, a local user can cause the kernel to copy uninitialized memory to userland.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
A local user needs to trigger the vulnerable function. This is possible via an X.25 Call Request.

Additional Details:
The commit message and code diff provided gives details on the source code affected and the fix applied. Specifically, the fix involves adding a `memset` call to properly initialize the dte structure before copying it.
