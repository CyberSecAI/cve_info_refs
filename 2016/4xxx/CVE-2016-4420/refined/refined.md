- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed packet processed by the NFS dissector can cause a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A vulnerability exists in the NFS dissector that allows for a crash when processing malformed packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition by crashing Wireshark.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting a malformed packet onto the network or convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to inject network packets or to provide a malicious packet capture file.
