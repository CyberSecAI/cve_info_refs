Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4952:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the VMware Paravirtual SCSI (PVSCSI) emulation within QEMU.
- The issue is that a guest can set the command descriptor ring buffer size to an arbitrary value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds (OOB) read/write access:**  By setting an arbitrary ring buffer size, a guest can cause the PVSCSI emulation code to read or write beyond the allocated buffer boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged user inside the guest can exploit this vulnerability to crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service for the virtual machine and potentially impacting the host system.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a malicious or compromised guest operating system that has the ability to configure the PVSCSI device.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when processing the `PVSCSI_CMD_SETUP_RINGS` or `PVSCSI_CMD_SETUP_MSG_RING` SCSI commands. These commands are used to initialize the command descriptor rings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have privileged access (e.g., root or administrator) within the guest operating system.
- The attacker also needs to be able to interact with the PVSCSI device, setting up the command descriptor rings via the specific SCSI commands.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `pvscsi_ring_init_msg` and `pvscsi_ring_init_data` functions within `hw/scsi/vmw_pvscsi.c`.
- The fix involves adding checks to validate the ring buffer size set by the guest. Specifically, there is now a check to ensure `ri->reqRingNumPages`, `ri->cmpRingNumPages` and `ri->numPages` are within the defined maximum number of pages `PVSCSI_SETUP_RINGS_MAX_NUM_PAGES` and `PVSCSI_SETUP_MSG_RING_MAX_NUM_PAGES`
- The patch changes `pvscsi_ring_init_msg` and `pvscsi_ring_init_data` from `static void` functions into `static int` functions, returning -1 when the checks fail and making the setup fail.
- The vulnerability was reported by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.
