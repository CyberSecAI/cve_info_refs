Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4840:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Coordinate Plus App fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL server certificate validation. This allows the app to connect to servers with invalid certificates, without warning the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can eavesdrop on encrypted communications between the app and the server. This could lead to the compromise of sensitive data being transmitted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based MITM attack. The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the app and the server.
- The provided analysis assumes a malicious wireless LAN access point is used to conduct the MITM attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic.
- The attacker must be able to create or control a malicious wireless access point or otherwise perform a MITM attack.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to occur, except for the user connecting to the compromised network.
