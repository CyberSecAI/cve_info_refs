Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the insecure deserialization of user-provided cookie data within the Chef Manage add-on. The software fails to validate the cookie data before deserializing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of validation before deserializing data, specifically within the cookie. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server. This could allow complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Cookie:** The attack vector is through crafted cookie data. An attacker sends a specially crafted cookie to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the system; they can initiate the attack remotely.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with malicious cookie data to the vulnerable Chef Manage instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Chef Manage add-on versions 1.11.4 and earlier.
*   Versions 1.12.0 and later are not affected.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Henrik Ferdinand NÃ¶lscher of Code-White GmbH.
*   The provided CVSS score indicates a critical severity.
