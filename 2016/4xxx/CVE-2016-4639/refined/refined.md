Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory initialization issue was present in the Login Window component of OS X.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory initialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user can cause a denial of service (DoS).
- According to the ZDI advisory, the vulnerability is triggered within CoreGraphics, specifically when interacting with `PKGTransactionWillSwitchSpaces`. This leads to a memory corruption condition, allowing arbitrary code execution in the context of the WindowServer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker needs to interact with the Login Window.
- User interaction is required, possibly by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- The ZDI advisory specifies that interaction with `PKGTransactionWillSwitchSpaces` within CoreGraphics triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the vulnerable OS X system.
- Ability to trigger the memory initialization issue in the Login Window or interact with CoreGraphics in the specified way.

**Additional Notes:**
- The ZDI advisory provides additional technical details, specifically mentioning that interaction with `PKGTransactionWillSwitchSpaces` within CoreGraphics triggers the memory corruption. This information is not present in the Apple security advisory.
- The ZDI advisory also indicates a CVSS score of 4.4, with the vector string `AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P`, which reflects a medium severity and describes the attack as local, requiring medium complexity, and not requiring authentication, with partial impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple by Yubin Fu of Tencent KeenLab, as well as an anonymous researcher working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.

In summary, CVE-2016-4639 is a memory initialization vulnerability in the Login Window of OS X that can be triggered by local users, potentially leading to a denial of service. The ZDI advisory adds more detail by explaining that the root cause is a memory corruption in CoreGraphics during interaction with `PKGTransactionWillSwitchSpaces`, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution in the context of the WindowServer.
