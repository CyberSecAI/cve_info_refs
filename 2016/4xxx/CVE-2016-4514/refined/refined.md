- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization. The switch series supports least privilege accounts, but a local proxy can be used to intercept traffic, allowing a low-privileged user to update the switch configuration, circumventing access controls.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Improper authorization (CWE-285): The system allows a low-privileged user to modify critical switch configurations via a local proxy. This bypasses the intended access controls.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
   - Attackers can gain access to management functions.
   - Attackers can update switch configurations.

- **Attack vectors**:
   - Remote exploitation is possible.
   - Local proxy is required to intercept traffic and modify configurations.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
   - Network access to the switch is required.
   - Ability to intercept and modify network traffic using a local proxy.
   - A low-privileged user account is needed to begin the attack.
