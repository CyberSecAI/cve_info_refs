  "CVE-2016-4995": {
    "description": "Users who are logged in with permissions to view some hosts are able to preview provisioning templates for any host by specifying its hostname in the URL, as the specific view_hosts permissions and filters aren't checked. If the organization or location features are enabled, the user will still be restricted to their associated orgs/locs. This can disclose configuration information about the host, including root password hashes if used in preseed/kickstart templates.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that view_hosts permissions and filters were not being checked when previewing provisioning templates using the hostname in the URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized users can access provisioning templates for any host, potentially disclosing sensitive configuration information, including root password hashes.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the URL to include a target host's hostname, unauthorized users can access provisioning template previews.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid user account with at least view_hosts permission, although they are not restricted by filters associated with the view\_hosts permission.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability affects Foreman versions 1.11.0 and higher. The vulnerability was introduced by a refactoring effort to remove DB queries from class of UnattendedController. The fix was achieved by applying a patch which was initially intended to fix a different issue: 'Unattended controller permission check does not work'."
