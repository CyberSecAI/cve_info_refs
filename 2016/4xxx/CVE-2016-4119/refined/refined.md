Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2016-4119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. It stems from a failure to properly handle the decompression of deflate-compressed data within a PDF file. Specifically, the issue occurs when the program attempts to use a heap buffer after it has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. A heap buffer is allocated, used, freed, and then an attempt is made to access it again, leading to a crash. This is because a pointer to the freed memory is not set to NULL and is later used as a function pointer.
*   **Incorrect Deflate Handling**: The vulnerability is triggered due to incorrect handling of deflate-compressed data, which leads to incomplete or corrupted image data and improper resource management. Specifically, the code calculates an incorrect buffer size, which then leads to the use after free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:**  The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially overwrite memory associated with the freed object and when the program attempts to execute a function at the memory location pointed by the vtable, it will instead execute attacker-controlled code.
*   **Application Crash:** At the very least, the vulnerability causes the application (Adobe Acrobat/Reader) to crash. This in itself can be a denial of service if an attacker can repeatedly trigger it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file designed to exploit the vulnerability. Opening this PDF in a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader will trigger the flaw.
*   **Image Object Manipulation**: The specific trigger within the PDF comes from an image object with compressed data. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating a single byte in the compressed data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Modify PDF:** The attacker needs the capability to create or modify a PDF document.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious PDF file using a vulnerable version of the software.
*   **No special system level access needed**: The attacker doesn't need prior access to the user's system. The vulnerability is exploitable via a normal user opening a malicious file.
