Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `vmsvga_fifo_run()` function of the QEMU's VMware SVGA graphics adapter emulation. This function processes commands from a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer. The core issue is the lack of a limit on the number of commands processed in a single call to `vmsvga_fifo_run()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The `vmsvga_fifo_run()` function could enter an infinite loop if the FIFO buffer contains a large number of commands or specifically crafted commands. The loop lacks a mechanism to prevent it from reading the FIFO indefinitely.
*   **Missing Loop Exit Condition:** The original code iterated as long as there were bytes in the FIFO without any safeguards to prevent indefinite looping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged attacker within the guest operating system can trigger the infinite loop in QEMU. This would cause the QEMU process to become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service for the virtual machine.
*   **Host Crash:** The denial of service would crash the QEMU process running on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest OS Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a privileged user inside the guest operating system.
*   **Malicious FIFO Commands:** The attacker needs to inject a large number of commands, or specifically crafted commands, into the SVGA FIFO buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker requires privileged (e.g., root/administrator) access within the guest OS.
*   **Guest OS Control:** The attacker needs control over the virtual machine and its guest operating system, allowing them to manipulate the SVGA FIFO buffer.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves adding a loop counter to the `vmsvga_fifo_run()` function that limits the maximum number of FIFO commands processed in a single call to 1024.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.
