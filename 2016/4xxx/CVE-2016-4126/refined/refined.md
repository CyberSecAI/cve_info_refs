Microsoft's bulletin also references CVE-2016-4126 as one of the vulnerabilities related to Adobe Flash Player, but the root cause of the flash vulnerability is different. The MS bulletin states that a web-based attack is possible with crafted Flash content through Internet Explorer. This is distinct from the AIR Installer issue."
