**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=837

TL;DR
you cannot hold or use a task struct pointer and expect the euid of that task to stay the same.
Many many places in the kernel do this and there are a great many very exploitable bugs as a result.

********

task_t is just a typedef for a task struct *. It's the abstraction level which represents a whole task
comprised of threads and a virtual memory map.

task_t's have a corrisponding mach port type (IKOT_TASK) known as a task port. The task port structure
in the kernel has a pointer to the task struct which it represents. If you have send rights to a task port then
you have control over its VM and, via task_threads, its threads.

When a suid-root binary is executed the kernel invalidates the old task and thread port structures setting their
object pointers to NULL and allocating new ports instead.

CVE-2016-1757 was a race condition concerning the order in which those port structures were invalidated during the
exec operation.

Although the issues I will describe in this bug report may seem similar is is a completely different, and far worse,
bug class.

~~~~~~~~~

When a suid binary is executed it's true that the task's old task and thread ports get invalidated, however, the task
struct itself stays the same. There's no fork and no creation of a new task. This means that any pointers to that task struct
now point to the task struct of an euid 0 process.

There are lots of IOKit drivers which save task struct pointers as members; see my recent bug reports for some examples.

In those cases I reported there was another bug, namely that they weren't taking a reference on the task struct meaning
that if we killed the corrisponding task and then forked and exec'ed a suid root binary we could get the IOKit object
to interact via the task struct pointer with the VM of a euid 0 process. (You could also break out of a sandbox by
forcing launchd to spawn a new service binary which would reuse the free'd task struct.)

However, looking more closely, even if those IOKit drivers *do* take a reference on the task struct it doesn't matter!
(at least not when there are suid binaries around.) Just because the userspace client of the user client had send rights
to a task port at time A when it passed that task port to IOKit doesn't mean that it still has send rights to it when
the IOKit driver actually uses the task struct pointer... In the case of IOSurface this lets us trivially map any RW area
of virtual memory in an euid 0 process into ours and write to it. (See the other exploit I sent for that IOSurface bug.)

There are a large number of IOKit drivers which do this (storing task struct pointers) and then either use the to manipulate
userspace VM (eg IOAcceleratorFamily2, IOThunderboltFamily, IOSurface) or rely on that task struct pointer to perform
authorization checks like the code in IOHIDFamily.

Another interesting case to consider are task struct pointers on the stack.

in the MIG files for the user/kernel interface task ports are subject to the following intran:

  type task_t = mach_port_t
  #if KERNEL_SERVER
      intran: task_t convert_port_to_task(mach_port_t)

where convert_port_to_task is:

  task_t
  convert_port_to_task(
    ipc_port_t    port)
  {
    task_t    task = TASK_NULL;

    if (IP_VALID(port)) {
      ip_lock(port);

      if (  ip_active(port)         &&
          ip_kotype(port) == IKOT_TASK    ) {
        task = (task_t)port->ip_kobject;
        assert(task != TASK_NULL);

        task_reference_internal(task);
      }

      ip_unlock(port);
    }

    return (task);
  }

This converts the task port into the corrisponding task struct pointer. It takes a reference on the task struct but that only
makes sure that it doesn't get free'd, not that its euid doesn't change as the result of the exec of an suid root binary.

As soon as that port lock is dropped the task could exec a suid-root binary and although this task port would no longer be valid
that task struct pointer would remain valid.

This leads to a huge number of interesting race conditions. Grep the source for all .defs files which take a task_t to find them all ;-)

In this exploit PoC I'll target perhaps the most interesting one: task_threads.

Let's look at how task_threads actually works, including the kernel code which is generated by MiG:

In task_server.c (an autogenerated file, build XNU first if you can't find this file) :

  target_task = convert_port_to_task(In0P->Head.msgh_request_port);

  RetCode = task_threads(target_task, (thread_act_array_t *)&(OutP->act_list.address), &OutP->act_listCnt);
  task_deallocate(target_task);

This gives us back the task struct from the task port then calls task_threads:
(unimportant bits removed)

  task_threads(
    task_t          task,
    thread_act_array_t    *threads_out,
    mach_msg_type_number_t  *count)
  {
    ...
    for (thread = (thread_t)queue_first(&task->threads); i < actual;
          ++i, thread = (thread_t)queue_next(&thread->task_threads)) {
      thread_reference_internal(thread);
      thread_list[j++] = thread;
    }

    ...

      for (i = 0; i < actual; ++i)
        ((ipc_port_t *) thread_list)[i] = convert_thread_to_port(thread_list[i]);
      }
    ...
  }

task_threads uses the task struct pointer to iterate through the list of threads, then creates send rights to them
which get sent back to user space. There are a few locks taken and dropped in here but they're irrelevant.

What happens if that task is exec-ing a suid root binary at the same time?

The relevant parts of the exec code are these two points in ipc_task_reset and ipc_thread_reset:

  void
  ipc_task_reset(
    task_t    task)
  {
    ipc_port_t old_kport, new_kport;
    ipc_port_t old_sself;
    ipc_port_t old_exc_actions[EXC_TYPES_COUNT];
    int i;

    new_kport = ipc_port_alloc_kernel();
    if (new_kport == IP_NULL)
      panic("ipc_task_reset");

    itk_lock(task);

    old_kport = task->itk_self;

    if (old_kport == IP_NULL) {
      itk_unlock(task);
      ipc_port_dealloc_kernel(new_kport);
      return;
    }

    task->itk_self = new_kport;
    old_sself = task->itk_sself;
    task->itk_sself = ipc_port_make_send(new_kport);
    ipc_kobject_set(old_kport, IKO_NULL, IKOT_NONE); <-- point (1)

  ... then calls:

  ipc_thread_reset(
    thread_t  thread)
  {
    ipc_port_t old_kport, new_kport;
    ipc_port_t old_sself;
    ipc_port_t old_exc_actions[EXC_TYPES_COUNT];
    boolean_t  has_old_exc_actions = FALSE;
    int      i;

    new_kport = ipc_port_alloc_kernel();
    if (new_kport == IP_NULL)
      panic("ipc_task_reset");

    thread_mtx_lock(thread);

    old_kport = thread->ith_self;

    if (old_kport == IP_NULL) {
      thread_mtx_unlock(thread);
      ipc_port_dealloc_kernel(new_kport);
      return;
    }

    thread->ith_self = new_kport; <-- point (2)

Point (1) clears out the task struct pointer from the old task port and allocates a new port for the task.
Point (2) does the same for the thread port.

Let's call the process which is doing the exec process B and the process doing task_threads() process A and imagine
the following interleaving of execution:

  Process A: target_task = convert_port_to_task(In0P->Head.msgh_request_port); // gets pointer to process B's task struct

  Process B: ipc_kobject_set(old_kport, IKO_NULL, IKOT_NONE); // process B invalidates the old task port so that it no longer has a task struct pointer

  Process B: thread->ith_self = new_kport // process B allocates new thread ports and sets them up

  Process A: ((ipc_port_t *) thread_list)[i] = convert_thread_to_port(thread_list[i]); // process A reads and converts the *new* thread port objects!

Note that the fundamental issue here isn't this particular race condition but the fact that a task struct pointer can just
never ever be relied on to have the same euid as when you first got hold of it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exploit:

This PoC exploits exactly this race condition to get a thread port for an euid 0 process. Since we've execd it I just stick a
ret-slide followed by a small ROP payload on the actual stack at exec time then use the thread port to set RIP to a gadget
which does a large add rsp, X and pop's a shell :)

just run it for a while, it's quite a tight race window but it will work! (try a few in parallel)

tested on OS X 10.11.5 (15F34) on MacBookAir5,2

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Apple OS X/iOS Kernel - IOSurface Use-After-Free

#### EDB-ID:

###### 40653

#### CVE:

###### [2016-4625](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4625)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [local](/?type=local)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=831

IOSurfaceRootUserClient stores a task struct pointer (passed in via IOServiceOpen) in the field at +0xf0 without taking a reference.

By killing the corrisponding task we can free this pointer leaving the user client with a dangling pointer. We can get this pointer used
by calling the create_surface_fast_path external method which will try to read and use the memory map off of the free'd task struct.

This bug could be leveraged for kernel memory corruption and is reachable from interesting sandboxes including safari and chrome.

build: clang -o surfaceroot_uaf surfaceroot_uaf.c -framework IOKit

You should set gzalloc_min=1024 gzalloc_max=2048 or similar to actually fault on the UaF - otherwise you might see some weird panics!

tested on OS X 10.11.5 (15F34) on MacBookAir5,2

#####################################

another PoC for "task_t considered harmful"
since 10.11.6 blocks us from creating userclients with other task's task ports
this time we create an IOSurface in the child and send back a send right to that
IOSurface to the parent (rather than sending the child's task port.)

The child then execs a suid-root binary which blocks on stderr and the parent
creates an IOSurface which maps any (writable?) page of the euid-0 process into theirs.
Overwrite a function pointer and win.

No race conditions because the task struct pointer is on the kernel heap, not the stack.
