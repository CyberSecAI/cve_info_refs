  "CVE-2016-4136": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is located in Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.242 and earlier, specifically within the Adobe Flash libraries used by Microsoft Internet Explorer 10, 11, and Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability is related to JXR processing and results in a double-free error.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a double-free, specifically a Use-After-Free (UAF) of plane->model_hp_buffer in the open-source JXR component within Adobe Flash. This type of vulnerability occurs when memory is freed twice, potentially causing corruption or other errors.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to a crash when the player is destroyed. It can be difficult to reproduce since the crash does not always show up. The crash can cause a denial of service.  The provided exploit details a heap overflow that can be triggered by loading a specific, maliciously crafted JXR file.  The provided details also indicated potential for arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a network-based attack. An attacker must lure the user to load a specially crafted JXR file in Adobe Flash Player.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content (specifically, a specially crafted JXR file). They also require a user to interact with their malicious content through a web browser that uses the vulnerable Adobe Flash Player component."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unspecified vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.242 and earlier.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unspecified vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.  The vulnerability exists in the Adobe Flash libraries within Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and Microsoft Edge.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Unknown impact and attack vectors.",
       "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is unspecified but is a network based attack.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The vulnerability requires a user to be on a network and to interact with content served by the attacker which exploits the flash player."
