  "CVE-2016-4020": {
    "description": "An information-exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of the Task Priority Register (TPR) access in QEMU's KVM VAPIC emulation, specifically in the patch_instruction() function for 32-bit Windows guests.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Exposure"
      ],
      "impact": "A privileged user/process inside a guest operating system can read portions of the host's stack memory, leading to information disclosure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploitation from a privileged guest user/process by accessing the Task Priority Register (TPR)."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Requires a privileged user inside a 32-bit Windows guest operating system.",
       "additional_notes": "The issue is related to how QEMU handles the Task Priority Register (TPR) when running 32-bit Windows guests using KVM. The vulnerability is due to an uninitialized stack variable (`imm32`) in the patch_instruction() function, which could leak host memory.  The fix involves initializing the variable before it is used. Affected versions include qemu-kvm-rhev versions prior to 2.9.0-10.el7 and qemu-kvm versions before 1.5.3-141.el7. This issue is present in multiple distributions including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and others that use QEMU."
