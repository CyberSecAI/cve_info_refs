Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-4340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A flaw in the "impersonation" feature of GitLab allowed any authenticated user to log in as any other user, including administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege Escalation: Any low-privileged user could gain the privileges of another user, potentially an administrator.
- Improper Access Control: The impersonation feature lacked proper access controls, allowing unauthorized impersonation.
- Insufficient Validation: The system did not properly validate the user performing the impersonation or the target user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full Account Takeover: Attackers could take over any user account, including administrator accounts.
- Data Breach: With admin access, an attacker could access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the system.
- System Compromise: By taking over admin accounts, attackers could gain complete control over the GitLab instance.
- Disruption of Services: Attackers could disrupt or disable services by making changes to the system using the compromised accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request manipulation: Attackers crafted a malicious POST request to the `/admin/users/stop_impersonation` endpoint.
- Authenticity Token reuse: Attackers used their own valid `authenticity_token` in the forged requests to bypass CSRF protection.
- Manipulated `id` parameter: The `id` parameter in the POST request was modified to specify the desired target user to impersonate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid GitLab account: The attacker needed a valid user account on the GitLab instance.
- Network Access: The attacker needed to be able to send HTTP requests to the GitLab server.
- Knowledge of the API: The attacker needed knowledge of the `/admin/users/stop_impersonation` API endpoint and how to construct the necessary POST request.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in GitLab version 8.2.
- The vulnerability was present in versions 8.2.0 - 8.2.4, 8.3.0 - 8.3.8, 8.4.0 - 8.4.9, 8.5.0 - 8.5.11, 8.6.0 - 8.6.7, 8.7.0.
- A patch was made available to address the vulnerability.
- The exploit is relatively simple to carry out.
