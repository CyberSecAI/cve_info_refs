  "CVE-2016-4796": {
    "description": "The provided data reveals a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `color_cmyk_to_rgb` function within the `color.c` file of the OpenJPEG library.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the color_cmyk_to_rgb function. This happens during a loop where pixel data is read and manipulated for color conversion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Out-of-bounds read leading to calculation",
      "Lack of proper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a maliciously crafted JPEG 2000 (JP2) image.",
      "The vulnerability can be triggered when converting a CMYK image to RGB"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted JP2 image to a vulnerable application using the OpenJPEG library.",
        "additional_details": "The overflow area is written using data from an out-of-bounds read. The out-of-bounds data is manipulated through colourspace conversion, making a successful C/I compromise high complexity but DoS is low complexity. The NVD assigned this a higher score but RedHat considered that unreasonable."
