Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-4497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a type confusion issue that occurs during the processing of a project file within Panasonic FPWIN Pro. Specifically, a specially crafted project file leads to type confusion in the `DeleteAndCreateSysRegDecls_And_SaveSysRegDeclsDatabaseIdsToTheSysRegDeclInfoMap` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion (CWE-843):** The program allocates or initializes a resource using one type, but later accesses it using an incompatible type, causing a jump through a vtable entry that is past the end of the vtable for the object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to achieve code execution under the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Project File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted project file.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user must open the malicious project file using the vulnerable application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a means of delivering the malicious file to the target user's system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malformed project file in Panasonic FPWIN Pro.
*   **Technical Knowledge:**  The attacker would require a certain degree of expertise to craft the malicious project file in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in Panasonic FPWIN Pro versions 5.x, 6.x, and 7.122 and prior.
*   Panasonic has released FPWIN Pro 7.130 to address this vulnerability
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*  The CVSS v3 base score is 4.2, with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
