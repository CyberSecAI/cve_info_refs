Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the baserCMS and its plugins. Specifically, this vulnerability exists in the core baserCMS system and in the "Blog", "Mail", and "Feed" plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (CWE-352):**  The system is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unintentionally performing actions on the baserCMS server by visiting a malicious website or link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to perform unintended actions on the baserCMS system by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.
*   This could include actions such as modifying content, altering configurations, or other administrative tasks depending on what functionality is exposed and susceptible to CSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL/Web Page:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL or web page. When a logged-in administrator accesses this URL/page, a forged request is sent to the vulnerable baserCMS application.
*   The attacker must convince a logged-in administrative user to visit this crafted resource.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No direct access to the server is needed:** The attacker does not need to directly access the server.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious URL.
*   **Knowledge of the target:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable application (baserCMS) and the administrator's actions.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges within the baserCMS system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that multiple CSRF vulnerabilities were found in different areas of baserCMS.
*   The affected plugins include "Blog", "Mail", "Feed", and "Uploader", but CVE-2016-4885 specifically refers to the CSRF vulnerability in the core system and the first three plugins. The "Uploader" plugin's CSRF is assigned to a different CVE (CVE-2016-4887).
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in version 3.0.11 of baserCMS and its plugins.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-4885 represents a CSRF vulnerability within the core of baserCMS and its plugins "Blog," "Mail," and "Feed". A successful exploit could lead to an attacker forcing an administrator to make unwanted modifications to the system.
