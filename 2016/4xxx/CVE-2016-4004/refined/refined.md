{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for file paths, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'file' parameter within the URL, an attacker can navigate outside of the intended directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator and be able to send HTTP requests to the target server."
