{
  "CVE-2016-4049": {
    "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the Quagga BGP routing daemon (bgpd). Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could send a crafted packet to crash the bgpd daemon resulting in denial of service.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The function `bgp_dump_routes_func` in `bgpd/bgp_dump.c` does not perform any size checks when writing data to `bgp_dump_obuf`. For each `bgp_node` table record, it tries to dump all data to `bgp_dump_obuf` stream which is of limited size. If there is no free space in this stream, the assertion fails and bgpd crashes.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Missing size check in `bgp_dump_routes_func` leading to a buffer overflow."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the `bgpd` daemon.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted BGP message packet to the vulnerable `bgpd` daemon.",
       "Requesting a route dump through the telnet interface when many BGP peers are present."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker with the ability to send network packets to the `bgpd` service, and knowledge of how to trigger the route dump functionality with enough neighbors"
