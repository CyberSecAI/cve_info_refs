Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in a permissions issue within Safari's handling of the `location` variable when using the `showModalDialog` method. Specifically, when a modal dialog is opened, Safari incorrectly uses the base URL of the parent window instead of the modal window's base URL when JavaScript navigation APIs are used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect base URL handling:** Safari incorrectly applies the parent window's base URL to the modal dialog when relative URLs are used for navigation via JavaScript APIs like `location="/"` or `window.open("/","_blank")` after the page has loaded.
- **`javascript:` URL in `<base>` tag:** Safari allows using `javascript:` URLs in the `<base>` tag.
- **Lack of origin check for modal navigation:** When a modal dialog navigates to a relative URL using Javascript API, Safari does not use the modal window's origin, instead it uses the parent's window origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS):** An attacker can achieve UXSS by exploiting the incorrect base URL handling. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a different domain, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage or unauthorized actions.
- **Data leakage:** As the description from Apple indicates, visiting a crafted website may lead to sensitive data leakage.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** An attacker crafts a malicious website containing the vulnerability.
- **`showModalDialog` usage:** The malicious website uses `showModalDialog` to open a modal window pointing to a target page.
- **JavaScript navigation in the modal:** The target page contains JavaScript that navigates to a relative URL.
- **`javascript:` URL in the parent's `<base>` tag:** The malicious website has a `<base>` tag with the `href` attribute set to a `javascript:` URL, injecting malicious javascript code when relative URLs in the modal navigate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to host a website:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious HTML page.
- **Bypass CSP if required:** The vulnerability exists even with Content Security Policy (CSP) blocking font loading, but img-src needs to be set to allow background image request.
- **Target must be using a vulnerable version of Safari**: Target must be using a Safari version prior to version 10.
- **User interaction:** The user needs to interact with the malicious website by clicking on a button in the parent window and the modal window.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in WebKit for over a year after it was reported.
- Mobile Safari is not affected, because it does not have the `showModalDialog` method.
- The vulnerability is triggered only when the navigation occurs after the completion of the page loading.
- The vulnerability does not occur when using the `<a>` tag or `xhr.open("GET",[URL])` for navigation, because these methods use the correct base URL of the modal.
- The attacker can control the javascript code injected by controlling the parent page's `<base>` tag.
