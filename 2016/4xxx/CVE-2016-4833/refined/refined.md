Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The "Nofollow Links" WordPress plugin had a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the `nofollow-links.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin was vulnerable to XSS, specifically a stored XSS, as mentioned in the JVN#13582657 description. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's functionality, which would then be executed in the browsers of users who access the affected part of the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user logged in as an administrator, allowing them to potentially:
    - Steal session cookies and hijack admin accounts
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the website
    - Perform other actions on behalf of the administrator

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network, which means a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerable component is within the `nofollow-links.php` file in the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system to perform the attack, meaning they can be a remote, unauthenticated user.
- The attacker requires user interaction, as the XSS will only be triggered when an administrator visits the affected section of the plugin.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable versions of the plugin are 1.0.10 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Gen Sato of TRADE WORKS Co.,Ltd. Security Dept.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download.
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.1 (Medium), and the CVSS v2 score is 2.6 (Low), according to JVN.
