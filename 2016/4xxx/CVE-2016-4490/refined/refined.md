Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the inconsistent use of `long` and `int` types for string/array lengths within the `cp-demangle.c` file of the libiberty library. Specifically:
    - Length variables are sometimes parsed as `long` (e.g., in `d_number` when parsing identifier lengths).
    - Length variables are sometimes used as `int` (e.g., when parsing an identifier in `d_identifier`).
    - The inconsistent use of type results in integer overflows, especially since the API exposed uses `int` types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is an integer overflow due to the inconsistent type usage which leads to an incorrect calculation of size. This allows for out-of-bounds access.
- **Write Access Violation:** Due to the integer overflow, a write access violation occurs when copying data based on the manipulated length.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash/Segmentation Fault:** The primary impact is a crash or segmentation fault due to the write access violation. This can lead to denial-of-service.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation**: While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds writes can often be leveraged for more severe exploits such as arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through crafted, mangled C++ symbol names. The demangler, when processing these maliciously crafted symbols, triggers the integer overflow.
- Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered when demangling virtual tables, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted, mangled C++ symbol name. This could be done by injecting the malformed symbol into a binary being demangled by the vulnerable library
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges, as the vulnerability lies within the processing of these symbols.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue involved parsing numbers as integers instead of longs to avoid the overflow and adding sanity checks.
- The issue was fixed in GCC versions 4.9.4, 5.4.0, 6.2.0, and later.
- The provided content includes references to other related CVEs and bug reports indicating a series of vulnerabilities in the libiberty demangler related to similar issues.
