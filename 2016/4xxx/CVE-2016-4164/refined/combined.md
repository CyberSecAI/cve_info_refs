[Latest](/adobe/brackets/releases/latest)

Brackets 1.14.2 is here! This release is targeted for `Mac` and `Windows` users only.

Open File in external Applications: Brackets now offers support to open file of any arbitrary type with external applications. In User Preferences settings, you can associate a file extension to open with the default associated application or open with a specific application.

Automatically associate Graphics file types to its OS default application: If an opened project folder has any graphics file of type: [`“xd”, “jpg”, “jpeg”, “svg”, “ai”, “png”, “psd”`], then with user’s consent Brackets will associate these graphics file types with its OS default associated application and record this under user preference settings under the category `“externalApplications”`.

[Brackets 1.14.1](/adobe/brackets/releases/tag/release-1.14.1)

The 1.14.1 release has a security update to fix remote exploitation by DNS rebinding vulnerability noticed with remote debugging enabled by default on application launch.

To address the security issue, the CEF debugger is disabled by default on application launch. Users who would want to enable debugging should launch Brackets from command line/terminal with the following command:

> Brackets.exe --remote-debugging-port=`Port No`

A toast notification will be shown in Brackets UI with the message “Remote debugging enabled on localhost:12345” for valid port number and remote debugging will be enabled. If port is not in the range between 1024 – 65534, the remote debugger is disabled on launch and a toast notification will be shown with the message “Cannot enable remote debugging on port <>. Port numbers should be between 1024 and 65534.”

[Release 1.12](/adobe/brackets/releases/tag/release-1.12)

Brackets 1.12 is here!

[Update] We are pulling down Brackets 1.12 release assets for a brief period to analyse LOC issues reported by users on various platforms. Rest assured this will be fixed on priority and re-establish the 1.12 download links again.

[05-02-2018] This newer build of Brackets 1.12 includes fix for an issue, specific to non-English locales, present in the previously released build. The issue prevented users from loading Brackets in a non-English language of their choice.
