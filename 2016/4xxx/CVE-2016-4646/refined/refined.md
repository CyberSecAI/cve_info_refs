Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4646:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure to validate a user-supplied value before using it as the size parameter in a call to `memcpy` within the handling of MOV files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Out-of-bounds read:  The lack of proper size validation allows an attacker to specify a size that exceeds the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read during the `memcpy` operation. This is a classic buffer overflow scenario, but instead of writing out-of-bounds, it's reading out-of-bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to leak sensitive information from the memory of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**

- Malicious MOV file: An attacker can craft a malicious MOV file containing the exploit.
- Malicious web page: An attacker can host the malicious MOV file on a web page and lure a user to visit it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote.
- User interaction: The vulnerability requires user interaction. The target user has to either open the malicious file or visit a malicious web page.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in the `ACMP4AACBaseDecoder` component of Apple OS X.
- The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley of Source Incite working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Apple released a patch to address the issue in OS X El Capitan v10.11.6 and Security Update 2016-004.
