# RHSA-2016:1271 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: python-django-horizon security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1271)

## Topic

An update for python-django-horizon is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
resources.

Security Fix(es):

* A DOM-based, cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the OpenStack dashboard, where user input was not filtered correctly. An authenticated dashboard user could exploit the flaw by injecting an AngularJS template into a dashboard form (for example, using an image's description), triggering the vulnerability when another user browsed the affected page. As a result, this flaw could result in user accounts being compromised (for example, user-access credentials being stolen). (CVE-2016-4428)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Beth Lancaster (Virginia Tech) and Brandon Sawyers (Virginia Tech) as the original reporters.

Bug Fix(es):

* Having two security groups with the same name previously resulted in not being able to launch an instance if it used one of these groups. This bug has been fixed. (BZ#1293232)
* Previously, under some circumstances, the hypervisor list was not alphabetized. In this update, the sort attribute has been changed, and badly sorted lists no longer occur. (BZ#1238092)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 6.0 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1238092](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238092)
  - horizon hypervisor list not ordered alphabetically
* [BZ - 1293232](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1293232)
  - horizon is using the Security Group name rather than the ID
* [BZ - 1343982](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1343982)
  - CVE-2016-4428 python-django-horizon: XSS in client side template

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-08 12:36:40 UTC  ```  Beth Lancaster and Brandon Sawyers from Virginia Tech reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By injecting Angularjs template in dashboard forms, such as image's description, an authenticated user may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability when another user browses the affected pages. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. All Horizon setups are affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-08 12:36:52 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the OpenStack project Upstream: Beth Lancaster (Virginia Tech), Brandon Sawyers (Virginia Tech)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c12)  Summer Long    2016-06-17 22:23:03 UTC  ```  Created python-django-horizon tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1347874](show_bug.cgi?id=1347874 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-4428 python-django-horizon: horizon: XSS in client side template [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2016-06-20 11:58:45 UTC  ``` Upstream advisory - OSSA-2016-010:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/565>  Upstream bug:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1567673](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1567673)  Upstream commit for master:  <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/horizon/commit/?id=62b4e6f30a7ae7961805abdffdb3c7ae5c2b676a>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-21 22:24:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:1271 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1271](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1271)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-21 22:24:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty)  Via RHSA-2016:1270 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1270](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1270)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-21 22:25:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2016:1268 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1268](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1268)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-21 22:40:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:1272 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1272](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1272)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-21 22:40:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:1269 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1269](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1269)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1343982#c19)  Fedora Update System    2016-06-30 19:52:23 UTC  ``` python-django-horizon-2015.1.4-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1269)

## Topic

An update for python-django-horizon is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
resources.

Security Fix(es):

* A DOM-based, cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the OpenStack dashboard, where user input was not filtered correctly. An authenticated dashboard user could exploit the flaw by injecting an AngularJS template into a dashboard form (for example, using an image's description), triggering the vulnerability when another user browsed the affected page. As a result, this flaw could result in user accounts being compromised (for example, user-access credentials being stolen). (CVE-2016-4428)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Beth Lancaster (Virginia Tech) and Brandon Sawyers (Virginia Tech) as the original reporters.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# [OSSA-2016-010] Possible client side template injection in horizon (CVE-2016-4428)

Bug #1567673 reported by
[Brandon Sawyers](https://launchpad.net/~brandor5)
on 2016-04-07

[26](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 3 people

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon) | Fix Released | Critical | [Tristan Cacqueray](https://launchpad.net/~tristan-cacqueray) | [OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) newton-2 "n2"](https://launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bmilestone/newton-2) |
|  | [OpenStack Security Advisory](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa) | Fix Released | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

I'm working through my groups process to deploy a new web app so that we can provide openstack in our production environment. Part of that process is having an authenticated security scan done by Acunetix.

I've attached a screenshot of the report for the alert received during the scan.

Unfortunately I'm not a dev, so I'm not sure if this is a false alarm or not.

Quick research found the following link which talks about the issue in general: <http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/01/xss-without-html-client-side-template.html>

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Brandon

I can confirm that Horizon is vulnerable to this exploit, since Django is involved in generating all top-level HTML, and that will always include templating in user-supplied data which is not sanitised for angularjs safety.

To reproduce, create a new Image with the Description set to:

{$

    "a".constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join;

    $eval("x=alert(1)")+""

 $}

Even though you receive an error, the value is templated back into the form by Django to be returned to the user, and the alert will pop up. A few times.

I believe the following code, added to the top of settings.py in Horizon, will blanket fix this issue.

 import django.utils.html

def escape(text, existing=django.utils.html.escape):

    # replace our angular markup string with a different string

    # (just happens to be the Django comment string)

    return existing(text).replace('{$', '{%').replace('$}', '%}')

django.utils.html.escape = escape

I have not done a thorough analysis of whether this is further exploitable, though I believe it is not. I am not sure whether it will damage any data in OpenStack (I don't know whether "{$" and "$}" are valid values of data anywhere in OpenStack).

I think the only place that could suffer from the blanket replacement is heat templates, and "{$" and "$}" are not part of that syntax.

The only change I'd make to the above patch therefore is to move it out into horizon.utils.escape.monkeypatch\_escape so that the bulk of the code wasn't in settings. It's not clear whether other code might import escape from the django.utils.html module (thus avoiding our ability to monkey-patch it) hence I have placed the code as early as possible in our application.

Thanks guys, I'll put this workaround in place and have our security group test again.

Appreciate all the help. :)

As a follow up, I applied the suggested workaround (putting the code into settings.py) and it cleared the alert reported above, but still alerted at /dashboard/auth/login.

I will attach a screenshot of the updated alert.

If there is anything else I can do to help, just let me know.

I believe that's a false positive as we don't use the standard "{{" and "}}" as our angular template markers, we use "{$" and "$}", hence the code I implemented escapes those and not the standard markers.

I have confirmed that with the code I propose above in place, the exploit is neutralised in the login page.

This could probably be fixed in the open, any concern if we switch this bug report to public ?

OSSG-coresec is now subscribed too.

If an attacker is able to inject code that is only rendered for themselves (as the PoC showed) then we shouldn't be too worried and we can fix in public. If there are other exploit vectors where an attacker can inject templates that are rendered for others then it's a more serious issue.

Is this a new issue or something we'll have to backport?

Alright, then we also need backport of patch in #15 for mitaka and liberty (kilo can be skipped since it's now eoled). This could be disclosed next week if all patches are approved by Friday.

@Brandon Sawyer, is there an affiliation we could reference in the advisory ?

Proposed impact description draft #1:

Title: XSS in Horizon client side template

Reporter: Brandon Sawyers

Products: Horizon

Affects: <=8.0.0, >=8.0.0 <=8.0.1 and 9.0.0

Description:

Brandon Sawyer reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By injecting angularjs template in dashboard forms such as image's description, an authenticated user may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability when another user browse the affected pages. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. All Horizon setups are affected.

I believe we've ratholed here before, and not meaning to kick up dust, but the "affects" is confusing. Is there any way we can make versions more clear? If not, no worries.

The affect lines format is defined here: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#impact-description-description>

I agree this isn't ideal, but at least it is exhaustive and similar to other OSSA.

Perhaps this one could be simplified to:

Affects: <=8.0.0, 8.0.1 and 9.0.0

Oups, sorry about that. I also fixed a couple of typos, here is impact description draft #3:

Title: XSS in Horizon client side template

Reporter: Beth Lancaster and Brandon Sawyers (Virginia Tech)

Products: Horizon

Affects: <=8.0.0, 8.0.1 and 9.0.0

Description:

Beth Lancaster and Brandon Sawyers from Virginia Tech reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By injecting Angularjs template in dashboard forms, such as image's description, an authenticated user may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability when another user browses the affected pages. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. All Horizon setups are affected.

Is (or will there be) a version between 8.0.0 and 8.0.1? If not, then this is also the same as...

Affects: <=8.0.1, 9.0.0

(assuming it will be fixed in 8.0.2 for stable/liberty and 9.0.1 for stable/mitaka)

## Synopsis

Important: python-django-horizon security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1272)

## Topic

An update for python-django-horizon is now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security
impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
resources.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version:
python-django-horizon: 2015.1.4 (BZ#1345822)

Security Fix(es):

* A DOM-based, cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the

OpenStack dashboard, where user input was not filtered correctly. An
authenticated dashboard user could exploit the flaw by injecting an
AngularJS template into a dashboard form (for example, using an image's
description), triggering the vulnerability when another user browsed
the affected page. As a result, this flaw could result in user accounts
being compromised (for example, user-access credentials being stolen).
(CVE-2016-4428)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Beth Lancaster (Virginia Tech) and Brandon Sawyers
(Virginia Tech) as the original reporters.

# OSSA-2016-010: XSS in Horizon client side template

# OSSA-2016-010: XSS in Horizon client side template[Â¶](#ossa-2016-010-xss-in-horizon-client-side-template "Link to this heading")

Date:

June 15, 2016

CVE:

CVE-2016-4428

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Horizon: <=8.0.1, >=9.0.0 <=9.0.1

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Beth Lancaster and Brandon Sawyers from Virginia Tech reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By injecting Angularjs template in dashboard forms, such as imageâs description, an authenticated user may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability when another user browses the affected pages. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. All Horizon setups are affected.

|  | [OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon) | Fix Released | Critical | [Tristan Cacqueray](https://launchpad.net/~tristan-cacqueray) | [OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) newton-2 "n2"](https://launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bmilestone/newton-2) |
|  | [OpenStack Security Advisory](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa) | Fix Released | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

I'm working through my groups process to deploy a new web app so that we can provide openstack in our production environment. Part of that process is having an authenticated security scan done by Acunetix.

I've attached a screenshot of the report for the alert received during the scan.

Unfortunately I'm not a dev, so I'm not sure if this is a false alarm or not.

Quick research found the following link which talks about the issue in general: <http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/01/xss-without-html-client-side-template.html>

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Brandon

I can confirm that Horizon is vulnerable to this exploit, since Django is involved in generating all top-level HTML, and that will always include templating in user-supplied data which is not sanitised for angularjs safety.

To reproduce, create a new Image with the Description set to:

{$

    "a".constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join;

    $eval("x=alert(1)")+""

 $}

Even though you receive an error, the value is templated back into the form by Django to be returned to the user, and the alert will pop up. A few times.

I believe the following code, added to the top of settings.py in Horizon, will blanket fix this issue.

 import django.utils.html

def escape(text, existing=django.utils.html.escape):

    # replace our angular markup string with a different string

    # (just happens to be the Django comment string)

    return existing(text).replace('{$', '{%').replace('$}', '%}')

django.utils.html.escape = escape

I have not done a thorough analysis of whether this is further exploitable, though I believe it is not. I am not sure whether it will damage any data in OpenStack (I don't know whether "{$" and "$}" are valid values of data anywhere in OpenStack).

I think the only place that could suffer from the blanket replacement is heat templates, and "{$" and "$}" are not part of that syntax.

The only change I'd make to the above patch therefore is to move it out into horizon.utils.escape.monkeypatch\_escape so that the bulk of the code wasn't in settings. It's not clear whether other code might import escape from the django.utils.html module (thus avoiding our ability to monkey-patch it) hence I have placed the code as early as possible in our application.

As a follow up, I applied the suggested workaround (putting the code into settings.py) and it cleared the alert reported above, but still alerted at /dashboard/auth/login.

I will attach a screenshot of the updated alert.

If there is anything else I can do to help, just let me know.

I believe that's a false positive as we don't use the standard "{{" and "}}" as our angular template markers, we use "{$" and "$}", hence the code I implemented escapes those and not the standard markers.

I have confirmed that with the code I propose above in place, the exploit is neutralised in the login page.

If an attacker is able to inject code that is only rendered for themselves (as the PoC showed) then we shouldn't be too worried and we can fix in public. If there are other exploit vectors where an attacker can inject templates that are rendered for others then it's a more serious issue.

Is this a new issue or something we'll have to backport?

OK, in that case this this seems like it may warrant an embargoed disclosure.

Alright, then we also need backport of patch in #15 for mitaka and liberty (kilo can be skipped since it's now eoled). This could be disclosed next week if all patches are approved by Friday.

Richard, can you please attach cherry-pick of the master patch ?

@Brandon Sawyer, is there an affiliation we could reference in the advisory ?

Proposed impact description draft #1:

Title: XSS in Horizon client side template

Reporter: Brandon Sawyers

Products: Horizon

Affects: <=8.0.0, >=8.0.0 <=8.0.1 and 9.0.0

Description:

Brandon Sawyer reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By injecting angularjs template in dashboard forms such as image's description, an authenticated user may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability when another user browse the affected pages. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. All Horizon setups are affected.

I believe we've ratholed here before, and not meaning to kick up dust, but the "affects" is confusing. Is there any way we can make versions more clear? If not, no worries.

The affect lines format is defined here: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#impact-description-description>

I agree this isn't ideal, but at least it is exhaustive and similar to other OSSA.

Perhaps this one could be simplified to:

Affects: <=8.0.0, 8.0.1 and 9.0.0

(assuming it will be fixed in 8.0.2 for stable/liberty and 9.0.1 for stable/mitaka)

# RHSA-2016:1268 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: python-django-horizon security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1268)

## Topic

An update for python-django-horizon is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
resources.

Security Fix(es):

* A DOM-based, cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the OpenStack dashboard, where user input was not filtered correctly. An authenticated dashboard user could exploit the flaw by injecting an AngularJS template into a dashboard form (for example, using an image's description), triggering the vulnerability when another user browsed the affected page. As a result, this flaw could result in user accounts being compromised (for example, user-access credentials being stolen). (CVE-2016-4428)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Beth Lancaster (Virginia Tech) and Brandon Sawyers (Virginia Tech) as the original reporters.

## Solution
