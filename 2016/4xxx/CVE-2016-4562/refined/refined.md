```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `DrawStrokePolygon()` function in `MagickCore/draw.c`. The issue arises because the code did not properly check for buffer overflows when resizing the `path_p` and `path_q` arrays within the `TraceStrokePolygon` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A buffer overflow can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution, compromising the integrity of the application and the system it is running on.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafted image files that cause `DrawStrokePolygon()` to be invoked with malicious inputs, leading to the buffer overflow when tracing stroke polygons.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image file to ImageMagick for processing that causes the `DrawStrokePolygon` function to allocate insufficient buffer size for path points."
