Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the parsing of `.vlp` files within Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE. Specifically, the software fails to validate the length of the filename field within the `.vlp` file (which uses the ZIP file format) before copying it to a fixed-length stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** This is the core weakness, arising from insufficient bounds checking when copying data into a stack buffer.
- **Lack of input validation:** The software does not properly validate the length of the filename field before processing it, allowing an attacker to provide an overly long name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable software.
- **Potential system compromise:** This can lead to complete control over the targeted system and potentially further access to the network depending on the specific environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely
- **User interaction required:** An attacker needs to induce a user to open a malicious `.vlp` file. This could be achieved through phishing, social engineering, or hosting the file on a website and enticing the user to download it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low skill level:** According to the ICS advisory, an attacker with a low skill level can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to craft a malicious file:** An attacker needs the capability to create or modify a .vlp file with an overly long filename.
- **Ability to induce a user to open the malicious file:** The attacker needs a means of delivering the file to a target and persuading them to open it using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

- The ZDI advisory provides a more specific CVSS score of 6.8 with the vector `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P` compared to the ICS advisory CVSS v3 score of 7.3 and vector `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`, The discrepancy between scores may be related to the versions used for calculation (v2 vs v3), or difference in analysis of the attack complexity, and user interaction.
- Unitronics has released a patch to fix the vulnerability (Version 9.8.30 or later).
