| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=70926#c0)  Marcel Böhme    2016-05-03 12:58:17 UTC  ``` A write access violation on destination operand in the libiberty demangler causes its host applications to crash. There are also two other read access violations on source operand that are caused by the same problem (overflow when parsing a number).  How to reproduce: $valgrind c++filt 0__Ot2m02R5T0000500000 ==86038== Invalid read of size 1 ==86038==    at 0x752150: do_type (cplus-dem.c:3729) ==86038==    by 0x7640F5: do_arg (cplus-dem.c:4239) ==86038==    by 0x7659D7: demangle_args (cplus-dem.c:4528) ==86038==    by 0x778425: demangle_signature (cplus-dem.c:1645) ==86038==    by 0x784701: internal_cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:1204) ==86038==    by 0x74F572: cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:887) ==86038==    by 0x406251: demangle_it (cxxfilt.c:62) ==86038==    by 0x40582E: main (cxxfilt.c:227)  $ valgrind c++filt 0__GT50000000000_ ==10196== Invalid read of size 8 ==10196==    at 0x7519A7: do_type (cplus-dem.c:3623) ==10196==    by 0x763DB5: do_arg (cplus-dem.c:4249) ==10196==    by 0x76568F: demangle_args (cplus-dem.c:4538) ==10196==    by 0x778825: demangle_signature (cplus-dem.c:1653) ==10196==    by 0x784961: internal_cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:1210) ==10196==    by 0x74F582: cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:893) ==10196==    by 0x406251: demangle_it (cxxfilt.c:62) ==10196==    by 0x40582E: main (cxxfilt.c:227)  $ valgrind c++filt __t2m05B500000000000000000_ ==13052== Invalid read of size 8 ==13052==    at 0x7541FF: do_type (cplus-dem.c:3798) ==13052==    by 0x76B2B3: demangle_template.constprop.15 (cplus-dem.c:2241) ==13052==    by 0x7761B7: demangle_signature (cplus-dem.c:1573) ==13052==    by 0x784811: internal_cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:1210) ==13052==    by 0x74F582: cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:893) ==13052==    by 0x406251: demangle_it (cxxfilt.c:62) ==13052==    by 0x40582E: main (cxxfilt.c:227)  Analysis: The demangler reads sometimes the value of an array index from the mangled string. Now, it is checked whether it exceeds the array length. However, the parsing can cause an overflow and the index is negative.  This vulnerability was found with a more efficient version of AFL.

```
Hi,

This fixes four access violations (<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70926>).

Two of these first read the value of a length variable len from the mangled string, then strncpy len characters from the mangled string; more than necessary.
The other two read the value of an array index n from the mangled string, which can be negative due to an overflow.

Bootstrapped and regression tested on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu. Test cases added to libiberty/testsuite/demangler-expected and checked PR70926 is resolved.

Best regards,
- Marcel

Hash: SHA256

> 1) Exploitable Buffer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

As far as we can tell, you sent a CVE request for this vulnerability
to cve-assign@...re.org (from a different email address of yours) on
2016-02-05, and we replied with a CVE ID on 2016-02-06. Is there an
additional aspect of 69687 that you are reporting now?

Our reply at that time was:

  > <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

  >> Since n is a signed int, n wraps over at some iteration. Since,
  >> realloc expects n to be unsigned, we end up allocating less memory
  >> then actually needed. In the beginning though n is too large and
  >> xrealloc simply complains. However, if you play a bit with the length
  >> of arg, you'll quickly turn that integer overflow in a buffer
  >> overflow.

  Use CVE-2016-2226 for this incorrect handling of a signed int.

> 2) Invalid Write due to a Use-After-Free (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70481>

Comment 2 says "two distinct bugs."

Use CVE-2016-4487 for the btypevec bug.

Use CVE-2016-4488 for the ktypevec bug.

> 3) Invalid Write due to Integer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70492>

Use CVE-2016-4489.

> 4) Write Access Violation (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70498>

Use CVE-2016-4490 for this issue described as "Root cause: In
cp-demangle.c sometimes length-variables are of type long ... Other
times they are of type int."

Note that this CVE ID is not about the Comment 1 "case where
consume_count returns -1" -- that comment does not belong in 70498 at
all.

> 5) Various Stack Corruptions (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70909>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00105>

Use CVE-2016-4491 for this issue caused by a lack of checking for "has
itself as ancestor more than once."

> 6) Write Access Violation (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70926>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00223>

Use CVE-2016-4492 for both of the "first read the value of a length
variable len from the mangled string, then strncpy len characters from
the mangled string; more than necessary" issues.

Use CVE-2016-4493 for both of the "read the value of an array index n
from the mangled string, which can be negative due to an overflow"
issues.
