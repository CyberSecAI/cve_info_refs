Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4169:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw that allows audit log events to be disclosed to unprivileged users. This suggests that access control mechanisms for viewing audit logs were insufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to view sensitive audit log information.
- **Information Disclosure:** This lack of access control leads to the potential for information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Exposure**: Unauthorized users could gain access to potentially sensitive information contained within audit logs. This could include details about user activity, system configurations, and other critical operational data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unprivileged Access:** An attacker could exploit this by accessing the system with an unprivileged account and viewing the audit logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the system**: The attacker would need to have some level of access to the system where the vulnerable Adobe Experience Manager instance is running, even if it's just a basic user account.
