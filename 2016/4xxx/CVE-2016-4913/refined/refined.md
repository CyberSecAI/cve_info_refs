Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4913:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is relevant to CVE-2016-4913. Multiple sources (Red Hat, Ubuntu, SUSE, Debian, and the upstream kernel commit) mention this CVE specifically in relation to a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of Rock Ridge extensions within ISO9660 filesystems.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `get_rock_ridge_filename` function within the `fs/isofs/rock.c` file of the Linux kernel. This function mishandles NM (alternate name) entries that contain null characters (`\0`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The function incorrectly calculates the total length of the filename when NM entries contain null characters. It sums the *claimed* sizes of NM entries instead of the actual collected length up to the null terminator. This can lead to an inflated size value.
    *   The inflated size value is then passed to the `readdir` callback, resulting in an out-of-bounds read when `__copy_to_user()` is called. The `__copy_to_user` function then reads beyond what was expected by the kernel, leading to a heap-based information leak.
    *   The vulnerability is present in the Rock Ridge implementation within the Linux kernel before version 4.5.5 and potentially even older versions (e.g., 0.98pl6+).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Leak:** A local attacker can mount a crafted ISO9660 filesystem image containing malformed NM entries, causing the kernel to leak sensitive information from kernel memory.
    *   **Denial of Service (Possible):** The inflated size passed to `readdir` could potentially cause DoS by consuming resources or crashing the system. However, the primary impact is seen as information leakage.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A local attacker needs the ability to mount a crafted ISO9660 filesystem image on the system.
    *   This can be done either via physical removable media, or via equivalent actions (e.g., mounting a disk image file), and may be relevant with virtualization.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to mount a file system.
    *   The attacker does *not* need any special privileges or authentication beyond the ability to mount.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves modifying the `get_rock_ridge_filename` function to correctly calculate filename lengths when handling null characters.
*   Some of the provided sources mention that SUSE has decided not to fix all CVEs, and refers to "TID 21496" for their policy on such matters. This note applies to various CVEs in the Linux Kernel.
*   Red Hat's advisory (RHSA-2018:3083) describes the information leak as a vulnerability in the handling of NM entries. They also note a missing check in the kernel that doesn't clear the SGID bit.
*   Ubuntu USN-3019-1 lists this CVE as an information leak. It also highlights that a local attacker needs to be able to mount a malicious iso9660 image.
*   Oracle's bulletin describes it as a local vulnerability.
*   The severity of this CVE is rated differently across different vendors, with Red Hat and SUSE rating it lower in terms of CVSS score compared to NVD.
*   The vulnerability exists because the `get_rock_ridge_filename` function sums the *claimed* sizes of the NM entries rather than the actual sizes read, and a null byte can terminate the collected data prematurely.

In summary, CVE-2016-4913 is a local information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ISO9660 filesystem handling due to incorrect length calculations when processing malformed NM entries in the Rock Ridge extensions. An attacker with the ability to mount an iso9660 image can leak portions of kernel memory by crafting malicious NM entries.
