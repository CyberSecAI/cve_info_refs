The provided content is related to CVE-2016-4965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands and execute them in the context of the root user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `diagnosis_control.php` page, including a malicious payload within the "graph" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a non-administrative authenticated account with access privileges to the `nslookup` functionality.
