Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-4571:

**Root Cause:**
- Uncontrolled recursion within the `mxml_write_node` function in `mxml-file.c`.

**Weakness:**
- The `mxml_write_node` function is vulnerable to stack exhaustion due to the recursive nature of its implementation when parsing a crafted XML file.

**Impact:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to stack exhaustion. A crafted XML file can cause the application using the `mxml` library to crash.

**Attack Vector:**
- Exploitation occurs through parsing of a specially crafted XML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious XML file for parsing. This might be achievable through various means such as uploading the file to a web service that uses the library, or by directly providing it through another interface where the library is used.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by recursion within the `mxml_write_node` function, which occurs when processing a specific structure within the malicious XML file.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with a relatively small stack size.
- This vulnerability is related to but distinct from CVE-2016-4570, which involves a different function (`mxmlDelete`) in `mxml-node.c` and a different crafted XML.
- The fix was applied in version `2.6-2+deb8u1` for Debian 8 "Jessie" and version `2.9-1.fc24` for Fedora 24.
