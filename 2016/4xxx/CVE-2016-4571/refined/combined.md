Subject: Re: CVE requested: two stack exhaustation parsing xml files using mxml

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> We found two stack exhaustion conditions that can easily crash mxml
> when parsing an xml.

(The two example XML documents seem dissimilar. For example,
stack-exhaustion-2.xml starts with "<?xml" whereas
stack-exhaustion-1.xml does not.)

> Recursion using mxmlDelete at mxml-node.c:217 (stack-exhaustion-1.xml)

Use CVE-2016-4570.

> Recursion using mxml_write_node at mxml-file.c:2739 (stack-exhaustion-2.xml)

Use CVE-2016-4571.

Package        : mxml
Version        : 2.6-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-4570 CVE-2016-4571 CVE-2018-20004
Debian Bug     : 825855 918007

Several stack exhaustion conditions were found in mxml that can easily
crash when parsing xml files.

CVE-2016-4570

    The mxmlDelete function in mxml-node.c allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (stack consumption) via crafted xml file.

CVE-2016-4571

    The mxml_write_node function in mxml-file.c allows remote attackers
    to cause a denial of service (stack consumption) via crafted xml
    file

CVE-2018-20004

    A stack-based buffer overflow in mxml_write_node via vectors
    involving a double-precision floating point number.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.6-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mxml packages.

Thanks!

The report of these stack exhaustions is here:

<http://www.msweet.org/bugs.php?U549> (but you need to register)

Just to clarify, since we compiled testmxml with ASAN, in order to
reproduce  using the attached files in the original binary it is
necessary to reduce a little the stack size, for instance:

$ ulimit -s 4000

The stack exhaustations are still possible with the original testmxml
binary, but it requires slightly bigger files.

```
