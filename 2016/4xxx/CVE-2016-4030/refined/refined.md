Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2016-4030, CVE-2016-4031, and CVE-2016-4032:

**Root Cause:**

*   Samsung Android phones expose a serial interface via USB, allowing communication with the modem. This interface is accessible even when USB tethering and USB debugging are disabled, and even when the device is locked.
*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that this modem interface is accessible via a secondary USB configuration that can be forced by the host, bypassing the default MTP interface used for file transfers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unprotected Modem Interface:** The modem interface exposed via USB lacks proper access control, allowing an attacker with physical access to interact with it without needing to unlock the device or enable debugging modes.
*   **AT Command Processing:** The system processes AT commands sent via the modem interface. Some commands are directly processed by the baseband modem, while others are interpreted by user-space applications, leading to potential unintended consequences.
*   **Configuration Switching:** The USB configuration can be switched by a connected host without the need to unlock the device, exposing the vulnerable modem interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can send arbitrary AT commands to the modem, which can be used to:
    *   Place phone calls
    *   Send SMS messages
    *   On older devices, even enable USB debugging or other system settings by using specific AT commands that are processed by user-space applications.
*   **Bypass Lock Screen:** These actions are possible even when the device is locked, bypassing the intended security measures.
*  **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly stated to be part of the CVE description, some AT commands could potentially be abused to disclose sensitive device information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target device.
*   **USB Connection:** The attacker must connect the device to a USB master device (e.g., a laptop).
*   **USB Configuration Switching:** The attacker needs to switch the USB configuration of the device to access the serial modem interface.
*   **AT Command Injection:** The attacker then injects specific AT commands to achieve the desired actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker must be in close physical proximity to the device.
*   **Technical proficiency:** The attacker needs to have the ability to use tools like `libusb`, or alternatively interact with the `/sys/bus/usb` pseudo-filesystem, to switch USB configurations.
*   **Knowledge of AT Commands:**  The attacker also needs to know which AT commands are necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   Samsung implemented a blacklist of dangerous AT commands on newer devices to mitigate some of the risks, but the general ability to communicate with the modem while locked still remained.
*   The `usbswitcher.c` tool mentioned in the text allows an attacker to automate the process of switching the device to the vulnerable configuration.
