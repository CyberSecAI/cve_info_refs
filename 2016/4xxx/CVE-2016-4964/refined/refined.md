{
  "cve": "CVE-2016-4964",
  "description": "The LSI SAS1068 Host Bus Adapter emulator in Qemu could enter an infinite loop while fetching new requests in mptsas_fetch_requests() if 's->state' was not operational.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The LSI SAS1068 Host Bus Adapter emulator in Qemu, periodically looks for requests and fetches them. A loop doing that in mptsas_fetch_requests() could run infinitely if 's->state' was not operational.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop in mptsas_fetch_requests() function due to missing state check"
    ],
     "impact": "A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this to consume excessive host resources or crash the Qemu process, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A privileged user within the QEMU guest environment can trigger the infinite loop."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
       "Privileged access within the guest operating system."
    ]
  },
  "patch": "The vulnerability was fixed by moving the state check to the beginning of the mptsas_fetch_requests function to avoid the infinite loop if the state is not operational."
