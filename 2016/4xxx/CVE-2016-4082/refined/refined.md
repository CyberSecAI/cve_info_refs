Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the GSM CBCH dissector in Wireshark. A malformed packet can trigger a crash in the dissector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The GSM CBCH dissector has a flaw that allows a specially crafted packet to cause a crash. This indicates a lack of proper input validation or error handling in the dissector code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as it crashes the Wireshark application.

**Attack Vectors:**
There are two main attack vectors:
    - Injecting a malformed GSM CBCH packet onto the network (wire).
    - Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file containing the malicious packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to either inject network traffic or create a malicious capture file.
    - The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system running Wireshark.
    - The attacker may not need to have deep knowledge of Wireshark internals beyond how to create such a packet.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by a buildbot fuzzer, which indicates it is likely a low-level parsing issue.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 and 1.12.0 to 1.12.10.
- It was fixed in Wireshark versions 2.0.3 and 1.12.11.
- The issue is tracked in Wireshark's issue tracker as issue 12278.
