The provided content discusses multiple security vulnerabilities patched in OS X El Capitan v10.11.6 and iOS 9.3.3. One of them is CVE-2016-4635.

**CVE-2016-4635**

*   **Vulnerability:** User interface inconsistencies in the handling of relayed FaceTime calls.
*   **Root Cause:** The issue stems from improper handling of relayed calls within the FaceTime application's user interface.
*   **Impact:** An attacker in a privileged network position can cause a relayed call to continue transmitting audio while appearing as if the call has terminated.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker in a privileged network position can exploit this by manipulating the relayed call.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network connection.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially eavesdrop on a user even after the user believes the FaceTime call is terminated.
