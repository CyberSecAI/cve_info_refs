- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to an incorrect size calculation when retrieving data from a SysTreeView32 control within the GMER application. The application uses `SendMessageA` with `TVM_GETITEMW` which expects a UNICODE string, but the buffer is sized for ANSI characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker needs to create a directory path longer than 99 characters.
    - The user needs to select the "Files" tab in the GMER application, which causes the long path to be displayed in the `SysTreeView32` control
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create files/directories on the system where GMER is executed. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by using the "Files" tab in GMER.
