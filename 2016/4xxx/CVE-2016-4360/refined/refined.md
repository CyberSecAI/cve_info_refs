Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file path validation in the `data.js` script of the HP Performance Center Virtual Table Server (VTS). Specifically, the `unlink` function, which is intended to delete temporary files, does not restrict file paths sent to it via the `path` parameter within the `data/import_csv` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By manipulating the `path` parameter in the `import_csv` request, an attacker can specify arbitrary file paths on the server's file system to be deleted.
- **Unrestricted File Deletion:** The server does not validate or sanitize the provided file path before passing it to the `unlink` function. This allows for the deletion of any file that the user running the VTS server process has the necessary permissions to access.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is accessible without requiring any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the server's file system accessible by the VTS server process.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The ability to delete arbitrary files, including those essential for the system to function, can result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the `path` parameter in the `data/import_csv` HTTP request, which is passed either through the URL query string or the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable VTS server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **HTTP Request Generation:** The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/data/import_csv` endpoint with a manipulated path parameter.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of HPE LoadRunner and Performance Center's VTS.
- The vulnerable script is `[HP_VTS_INSTALL_DIR]\web\admin\data.js`
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a file upload with a POST request to `url /data/import_csv` with a `Content-Disposition: form-data; name=fileToUpload` in the body, where the `path` parameter is extracted.
- A fix was released by HPE in Performance Center version 12.53.
