Subject: CVE Request: Squid HTTP caching proxy

Hi,
 several serious issues have been reported about the Squid proxy.

(URLs below are now all public, but some of our mirrors may take a few
more hours to pick up the changes).

1) Cache Poisoning issue in HTTP Request handling

Incorrect input validation of HTTP Request messages lets clients use an
absolute-URI on port 80 to bypass the protection previously added to
Squid for CVE-2009-0801 and other related attack vectors. This can lead
to cache poisoning of the Squid and browser caches, bypass of
same-origin and sandbox protections in browsers.

All Squid 2.x are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.2.0.10 are not vulnerable unless
 they have been patched for CVE-2009-0801.
All Squid-3.2.0.11 and later up to and including 3.5.17 are vulnerable.
All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.0.9 are vulnerable.

Advisory at <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_7.txt>>

Patch at
<<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-14039.patch>>
(patches for other versions are TBD.)

2) Header Smuggling issue in HTTP Request processing

Incorrect input validation allows a client to smuggle Host header value
past same-origin security protections to cause Squid operating as
interception or reverse-proxy to contact the wrong origin server. Also
poisoning any downstream cache which stores the response.

However, the cache poisoning is only possible if the caching agent
(browser or explicit/forward proxy) is not following RFC 7230 processing
guidelines and lets the smuggled value through.

NP: This appears to be an example of CWE-144, but smuggling just a
specific header value instead of a whole message. The result is the same
as documented for message smuggling but much harder to detect by
observing log content - since there is no unexplained message or
response corruption after the attack has happened.

All 2.x versions up to and including 2.7.STABLE9 are vulnerable.
All 3.x versions up to and including 3.5.17 are vulnerable.
All 4.x versions are not vulnerable.

Advisory at <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_8.txt>>

Patches at:
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/squid-3.1-10496.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/squid-3.2-11842.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.3/changesets/squid-3.3-12698.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/changesets/squid-3.4-13236.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-14038.patch>>

3) Multiple Denial of Service issues in ESI Response processing.

Due to incorrect pointer handling and reference counting Squid is
vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing ESI responses.

All Squid-2.x are not vulnerable.
Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.17 and 4.x up to and including 4.0.9
are affected. Vulnerability is configuration and build dependent. see
the advisory for more detail if interested.

Advisory at <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_9.txt>>

Patches at:
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/changesets/SQUID-2016_9.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID-2016_9.patch>>

Debian Bug     : 823968

Several security issues have been discovered in the Squid caching proxy.

CVE-2016-4051:

  CESG and Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that Squid cachemgr.cgi was
  vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing remotely supplied
  inputs relayed through Squid.

CVE-2016-4052:

  CESG discovered that a buffer overflow made Squid vulnerable to a
  Denial of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses.

CVE-2016-4053:

  CESG found that Squid was vulnerable to public information
  disclosure of the server stack layout when processing ESI responses.

CVE-2016-4054:

  CESG discovered that Squid was vulnerable to remote code execution
  when processing ESI responses.

CVE-2016-4554:

  Jianjun Chen found that Squid was vulnerable to a header smuggling
  attack that could lead to cache poisoning and to bypass of
  same-origin security policy in Squid and some client browsers.

CVE-2016-4555, CVE-2016-4556:

  "bfek-18" and "@vftable" found that Squid was vulnerable to a Denial
  of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses, due to
  incorrect pointer handling and reference counting.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u3.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 3.5.19-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

## Synopsis

Moderate: squid security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1138)

## Topic

An update for squid is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Squid cachemgr.cgi utility processed remotely relayed Squid input. When the CGI interface utility is used, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4051)
* Buffer overflow and input validation flaws were found in the way Squid processed ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy, or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a remote attacker able to control ESI components on an HTTP server could use these flaws to crash Squid, disclose parts of the stack memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Squid. (CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054)
* An input validation flaw was found in Squid's mime\_get\_header\_field() function, which is used to search for headers within HTTP requests. An attacker could send an HTTP request from the client side with specially crafted header Host header that bypasses same-origin security protections, causing Squid operating as interception or reverse-proxy to contact the wrong origin server. It could also be used for cache poisoning for client not following RFC 7230. (CVE-2016-4554)
* An incorrect reference counting flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid is configured as reverse-proxy, for TLS/HTTPS interception, an attacker controlling a server accessed by Squid, could crash the squid worker, causing a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-4556)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.

## Synopsis

Moderate: squid security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1139)

## Topic

An update for squid is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Squid cachemgr.cgi utility processed remotely relayed Squid input. When the CGI interface utility is used, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4051)
* Buffer overflow and input validation flaws were found in the way Squid processed ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy, or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a remote attacker able to control ESI components on an HTTP server could use these flaws to crash Squid, disclose parts of the stack memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Squid. (CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054)
* An input validation flaw was found in the way Squid handled intercepted HTTP Request messages. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the protection against issues related to CVE-2009-0801, and perform cache poisoning attacks on Squid. (CVE-2016-4553)
* An input validation flaw was found in Squid's mime\_get\_header\_field() function, which is used to search for headers within HTTP requests. An attacker could send an HTTP request from the client side with specially crafted header Host header that bypasses same-origin security protections, causing Squid operating as interception or reverse-proxy to contact the wrong origin server. It could also be used for cache poisoning for client not following RFC 7230. (CVE-2016-4554)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a malicious server could use this flaw to crash the Squid worker process. (CVE-2016-4555)
* An incorrect reference counting flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid is configured as reverse-proxy, for TLS/HTTPS interception, an attacker controlling a server accessed by Squid, could crash the squid worker, causing a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-4556)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.

## Synopsis

Moderate: squid34 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1140)

## Topic

An update for squid34 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The "squid34" packages provide version 3.4 of Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects. Note that apart from "squid34", this version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux also includes the "squid" packages which provide Squid version 3.1.

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Squid cachemgr.cgi utility processed remotely relayed Squid input. When the CGI interface utility is used, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4051)
* Buffer overflow and input validation flaws were found in the way Squid processed ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy, or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a remote attacker able to control ESI components on an HTTP server could use these flaws to crash Squid, disclose parts of the stack memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Squid. (CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054)
* An input validation flaw was found in the way Squid handled intercepted HTTP Request messages. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the protection against issues related to CVE-2009-0801, and perform cache poisoning attacks on Squid. (CVE-2016-4553)
* An input validation flaw was found in Squid's mime\_get\_header\_field() function, which is used to search for headers within HTTP requests. An attacker could send an HTTP request from the client side with specially crafted header Host header that bypasses same-origin security protections, causing Squid operating as interception or reverse-proxy to contact the wrong origin server. It could also be used for cache poisoning for client not following RFC 7230. (CVE-2016-4554)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a malicious server could use this flaw to crash the Squid worker process. (CVE-2016-4555)
* An incorrect reference counting flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid is configured as reverse-proxy, for TLS/HTTPS interception, an attacker controlling a server accessed by Squid, could crash the squid worker, causing a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-4556)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Some attackers may also be able  to use valid certificates for one domain signed by a global  Certificate Authority to abuse an unrelated domain.   However, the bug is exploitable only if you have configured  Squid to perform SSL Bumping with the "client-first" or "bump"  mode of operation.    Sites that do not use SSL-Bump are not vulnerable.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid version 3.5.4, 3.4.13, 3.3.14, and  3.2.14.   In addition, patches addressing this problem for stable releases  can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 3.2: <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/squid-3.2-11836.patch>  Squid 3.3: <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.3/changesets/squid-3.3-12690.patch>  Squid 3.4: <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/changesets/squid-3.4-13222.patch>  Squid 3.5: <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13817.patch>   If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:    All Squid-2.x, 3.0 and 3.1 are not vulnerable to the problem.   1) Run "squid -v" to determine if SSL support is enabled.   All Squid built without SSL support are not vulnerable to the  problem.   2) Run "squid -k parse 2>&1 | grep ssl_bump" to determine if SSL-Bump is being used.    All Squid-3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 operating with ssl_bump omitted  from squid.conf are not vulnerable to the problem.    All unpatched Squid-3.x operating with "ssl_bump client-first"  in squid.conf are vulnerable to the problem.   All unpatched Squid-3.x operating with "ssl_bump bump" in   squid.conf are vulnerable to the problem.  __________________________________________________________________  Workaround:   There is no workaround for Squid-3.2.   For Squid-3.3 and 3.4, upgrade the squid.conf settings to use  "ssl_bump server-first".   For Squid-3.5, upgrade the squid.conf settings to use a  "ssl_bump peek" operation before the "bump" operation.    NOTE that these workarounds do not resolve the vulnerability,   but allow Squid to relay (or mimic) the invalid certificate to   clients and depends on validation in the client.   Or,   Disable SSL-Bump. Which may be done in the following ways:   * Build Squid-3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 with ./configure --disable-ssl   * Build Squid-3.5 with ./configure --without-openssl   * Remove from squid.conf (and include'd files) any ssl_bump    directives.  __________________________________________________________________  Contact details for the Squid project:   For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions  of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary  package vendor.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 16 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
The Squid HTTP proxy has been updated to version 3.3.14, fixing the
following security issues:
- Fixed multiple Denial of Service issues in HTTP Response processing.
(CVE-2016-2569, CVE-2016-2570, CVE-2016-2571, CVE-2016-2572, bsc#968392,
bsc#968393, bsc#968394, bsc#968395)
- CVE-2016-3947: Buffer overrun issue in pinger ICMPv6 processing.
(bsc#973782)
- CVE-2015-5400: Improper protection of alternate path. (bsc#938715)
- CVE-2015-3455: Squid http proxy configured with client-first SSL bumping
did not correctly validate server certificate. (bsc#929493)
- CVE-2016-3948: Fixed denial of service in HTTP Response processing
(bsc#973783)
- CVE-2016-4051: fixes buffer overflow in cachemgr.cgi (bsc#976553)
- CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054: Fixed multiple issues in
ESI processing (bsc#976556)
- CVE-2016-4553: Fixed cache poisoning issue in HTTP Request handling
(bsc#979009)
- CVE-2016-4554: Fixed header smuggling issue in HTTP Request processing
(bsc#979010)
- Fixed multiple Denial of Service issues in ESI Response processing.
(CVE-2016-4555, CVE-2016-4556, bsc#979011, bsc#979008)
Additionally, the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- Fix header size in script unsquid.pl. (bsc#902197)
- Add external helper ext\_session\_acl to package. (bsc#959290)
- Update forward\_max\_tries to permit 25 server paths With cloud sites
becoming more popular more CDN servers are producing long lists of IPv6
and IPv4 addresses. If there are not enough paths selected the IPv4 ones
may never be reached.
- squid.init: wait that squid really dies when we kill it on upgrade
instead
of proclaiming its demise prematurely (bnc#963539)

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2016:9
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2016:9
Date: May 06, 2016
Summary: Multiple Denial of Service issues
in ESI Response processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.x -> 3.5.17
Squid 4.x -> 4.0.9
Fixed in version: Squid 4.0.10, 3.5.18
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016\_9.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4555
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4556
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrect pointer handling and reference counting Squid is
vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing ESI
responses.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
These problems allow a remote server delivering certain ESI
response syntax to trigger a denial of service for all clients
accessing the Squid service.
Due to unrelated changes Squid-3.5 has become vulnerable to some
regular ESI server responses also triggering one or more of these
issues.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 3.5.18 and 4.0.10.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.4:
Squid 3.5:
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid-2.x are not vulnerable.
All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.0 versions built without --enable-esi are not
vulnerable.
All Squid-3.0 versions built with --enable-esi and used for
reverse-proxy are vulnerable to the CVE-2016-4556 problem.
All Squid-3.1 are not vulnerable to the CVE-2016-4555 problem.
All Squid-3.1 and later versions up to and including
Squid-3.5.17 being used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable to
both problems.
All Squid-3.1 and later versions up to and including
Squid-3.5.17 being used for TLS / HTTPS interception are
vulnerable to both problems.
All unpatched Squid-4.0 up to and including Squid-4.0.9
being used as reverse-proxy are vulnerable to both problems.
All unpatched Squid-4.0 up to and including Squid-4.0.9
being used as TLS/HTTPS intercept proxy are vulnerable to both
problems.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workaround:
Build Squid with --disable-esi
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your
primary support point. For subscription details see
.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed
list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports
are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

| [Description](#c0)  Master One    2004-06-11 04:34:13 UTC  ``` I performed an emerge -uD world today, which updated grep from 2.5.1-r1 to 2.5.1-r2 and installed libpcre-4.4 as a dependency (the perl useflag is new in grep-2.5.1-r2, it's not in the 2.5.1-r1 ebuild).  This led to a failure in calculating module dependencies on boot.  I just downgraded to grep-2.5.1-r1, unmerged libpcre, and everything seems to be fine again. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Master One    2004-06-11 06:04:07 UTC  ``` Ok, I just reemerged latest grep-2.5.1-r2 with USE="-perl" and everything is still working fine, no error messages on boot, so it has to be a problem related to libpcre-4.4. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tim Tailor    2004-06-11 13:24:25 UTC  ``` Just hit the same problem and then also downgraded grep. After that it worked again. I think it is a dependency problem.. localmount -> runscript.sh -> grep and grep is dynamically linked to /usr/lib/libpcre.so.0  So in case your /usr is on a partition of its own, you are in trouble..   ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-11 16:31:09 UTC  ``` yep.  [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=53627#c2) is right on.  I've modified the ebuild to link it statically if you have USE="perl" which should fix this. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-11 16:31:35 UTC  ``` Resync and try it again please. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-11 23:48:42 UTC  ``` Actually, -r4 is better. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Master One    2004-06-12 01:19:22 UTC  ``` I indeed have /usr on a separate partition, and 2.5.1-r4 fixed it, I just emerged it, unmerged libpcre and did a reboot, now everything is fine again. ``` |  |

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

Use CVE-2016-4553.

Use CVE-2016-4555 for the vulnerability in client_side_request.cc -
here, "if (aConn)" was added.

Use CVE-2016-4556 for the vulnerability in Esi.cc - it is
described as "was being unlocked without having been locked."

> Due to unrelated changes Squid-3.5 has become vulnerable to some
> regular ESI server responses also triggering one or more of these
> issues.
>
> This bug is fixed by Squid version 3.5.18 and 4.0.10.

As far as we can tell, this does not really mean that there is an
additional vulnerability in 3.5.17 that did not exist in 4.0.9.
Instead, it means that the vulnerabilities are the same, but in 3.5.x
people might notice the vulnerabilities being exploited accidentally.

> (URLs below are now all public, but some of our mirrors may take a few

This means, for example, that the URLs work if one manually locates
all instances of www.squid-cache.org and inserts www1.jp.squid-cache.org
instead. See <http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html>
for other options.

Resulting in a double-free. Make it use RefCount instead of

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [squid3](/security/cves?package=squid3) - Web proxy cache server

## Details

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that the Squid pinger utility incorrectly

handled certain ICMPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to

cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly cause

Squid to leak information into log files. ([CVE-2016-3947](/security/CVE-2016-3947))

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that the Squid cachemgr.cgi tool incorrectly

handled certain crafted data. A remote attacker could use this issue to

cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-4051](/security/CVE-2016-4051))

It was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain Edge Side Includes

(ESI) responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-4052](/security/CVE-2016-4052), [CVE-2016-4053](/security/CVE-2016-4053), [CVE-2016-4054](/security/CVE-2016-4054))

Jianjun Chen discovered that Squid did not correctly ignore the Host header

when absolute-URI is provided. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to conduct cache-poisoning attacks. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-4553](/security/CVE-2016-4553))

Jianjun Chen discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain HTTP Host

headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to conduct

cache-poisoning attacks. ([CVE-2016-4554](/security/CVE-2016-4554))

It was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain Edge Side Includes

(ESI) responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4555](/security/CVE-2016-4555),

[CVE-2016-4556](/security/CVE-2016-4556))
