kvm:vmx: more complete state update on APICv on/off

```
The function to update APICv on/off state (in particular, to deactivate
it when enabling Hyper-V SynIC) is incomplete: it doesn't adjust
APICv-related fields among secondary processor-based VM-execution
controls.  As a result, Windows 2012 guests get stuck when SynIC-based
auto-EOI interrupt intersected with e.g. an IPI in the guest.

In addition, the MSR intercept bitmap isn't updated every time "virtualize
x2APIC mode" is toggled.  This path can only be triggered by a malicious
guest, because Windows didn't use x2APIC but rather their own synthetic
APIC access MSRs; however a guest running in a SynIC-enabled VM could
switch to x2APIC and thus obtain direct access to host APIC MSRs
([CVE-2016-4440](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-862v-p357-9hfp "CVE-2016-4440")).

The patch fixes those omissions.

## Description

arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 mishandles the APICv on/off state, which allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Subject: CVE-2016-4440 Kernel: kvm: vmx: incorrect state update leading to
 MSR access

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based virtual machine(CONFIG_KVM) along
with Hyper-v Synthetic Interrupt Controller(SynIC) support is vulnerable to an
undue APIC register access issue. In that a guest with SynIC enabled, could
gain access to host's Machine Specific Registers(MSR).

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel
resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to escalate privileges on the
host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/152191>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337806>
   -> <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/152100>

'CVE-2016-4440' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.

kvm:vmx: more complete state update on APICv on/offThe function to update APICv on/off state (in particular, to deactivate
it when enabling Hyper-V SynIC) is incomplete: it doesn't adjust
APICv-related fields among secondary processor-based VM-execution
controls. As a result, Windows 2012 guests get stuck when SynIC-based
auto-EOI interrupt intersected with e.g. an IPI in the guest.
In addition, the MSR intercept bitmap isn't updated every time "virtualize
x2APIC mode" is toggled. This path can only be triggered by a malicious
guest, because Windows didn't use x2APIC but rather their own synthetic
APIC access MSRs; however a guest running in a SynIC-enabled VM could
switch to x2APIC and thus obtain direct access to host APIC MSRs
(CVE-2016-4440).
The patch fixes those omissions.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1337806#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2016-05-20 06:37:59 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based virtual machine(CONFIG_KVM) along with Hyper-v Synthetic Interrupt Controller(SynIC) support is vulnerable to an undue APIC register access issue. In that a guest with SynIC enabled, could gain access to host's Machine Specific Registers(MSR).  A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to escalate privileges on the host.  Upstream patch: ---------------   -> <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/152191>  Reference: ----------   -> <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/152100>   Note: It requires fairly latest features to be available and enabled on the host(APICv) as well as in the guest(-hv-synic).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1337806#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2016-05-20 06:38:48 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1337807](show_bug.cgi?id=1337807 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-4440 Kernel: kvm: vmx: incorrect state update leading to APIC register access [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1337806#c2)  Prasad Pandit    2016-05-20 06:39:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1337806#c4)  Fedora Update System    2016-06-02 14:58:20 UTC  ``` kernel-4.5.5-201.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1337806#c5)  Fedora Update System    2016-06-18 18:50:00 UTC  ``` kernel-4.5.6-300.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.
