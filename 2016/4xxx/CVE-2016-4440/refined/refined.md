Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4440:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete update of the APICv (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller virtualization) on/off state within the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation, specifically in the `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c` file.
*   The code responsible for deactivating APICv when enabling Hyper-V SynIC (Synthetic Interrupt Controller) didn't correctly adjust APICv-related fields in the secondary processor-based VM-execution controls.
*   Additionally, the MSR (Model Specific Register) intercept bitmap was not updated when "virtualize x2APIC mode" was toggled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incomplete State Update:** The primary issue is the incomplete state update for APICv on/off transitions. Specifically, the secondary VM execution controls were not updated correctly when APICv was deactivated.
*   **Missing MSR Intercept:** The MSR intercept bitmap was not consistently updated, particularly when switching to x2APIC mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest OS user could exploit this vulnerability to crash the host OS kernel.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability could potentially allow a guest OS user to execute arbitrary code on the host OS.
*   **Direct APIC MSR Access:**  A guest OS could gain direct access to the host's APIC MSRs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest OS:** The attack is launched from within a virtual machine (guest OS) running on a vulnerable host.
*   **x2APIC Mode Switching:**  The guest OS needs to switch to x2APIC mode to trigger the direct MSR access.
*   **Hyper-V SynIC:**  The vulnerability is triggered in a guest OS that has Hyper-V SynIC enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Access in Guest OS:** The attacker needs to have privileged access within the guest OS (e.g., root or administrator).
*   **Virtualization Environment:** Requires a vulnerable Linux kernel with KVM and support for APICv and Hyper-V SynIC.
*   **x2APIC Capability**: The guest OS must be able to enable x2APIC mode.

**More Details:**

*   The commit message on the Linux kernel git repository (3ce424e) provides the following details:
    *   Windows 2012 guests can get stuck when a SynIC-based auto-EOI interrupt intersects with an IPI in the guest. This is caused by the incomplete state update.
    *   Although Windows does not use x2APIC directly, a SynIC-enabled guest can switch to x2APIC and gain access to host APIC MSRs due to the missing MSR intercept.
*   The fix includes:
    *   Updating the secondary VM execution controls when APICv is toggled to correctly set/clear  `SECONDARY_EXEC_APIC_REGISTER_VIRT` and `SECONDARY_EXEC_VIRTUAL_INTR_DELIVERY` bits
    *   Ensuring the MSR bitmap is correctly updated in `vmx_set_msr_bitmap` based on the `SECONDARY_EXEC_VIRTUALIZE_X2APIC_MODE` control.

This vulnerability is considered high severity due to the potential for both denial of service and privilege escalation on the host.
