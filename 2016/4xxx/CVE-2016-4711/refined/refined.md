The provided content includes information about security updates for macOS Sierra 10.12 and iOS 10, and it contains a description for CVE-2016-4711.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An input validation issue existed in corecrypto. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when an application uses CCrypt and the output and input buffer are the same.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Input validation issue.
- Potential for sensitive plaintext disclosure in CCrypt usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An application using CCrypt may disclose sensitive plaintext if the output and input buffer are the same.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to have control over an application that uses the vulnerable CCrypt function, and the application needs to pass the same memory location for the input and output buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have the ability to influence an application that utilizes the `CCrypt` function and can manipulate the input and output buffers.
