Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in integer overflows during memory allocation within the `addcslashes` function. Specifically, the function calculates the required buffer size for the escaped string by multiplying the input string length by 4 (`4 * ZSTR_LEN(str)`). If the input string is sufficiently long, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-required buffer being allocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication to determine the required buffer size for `addcslashes` can overflow, resulting in a smaller buffer than needed being allocated.
- **Heap Overflow:** Writing to the undersized buffer causes a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Heap Corruption:** The heap overflow corrupts memory, which may cause unpredictable behavior.
- **Segmentation Fault:** The memory corruption can lead to a segmentation fault (crash).

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted long string as input to the `addcslashes` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to control the input string used by the `addcslashes` function.

**Technical Details:**
The original bug report includes code snippets demonstrating the vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of relevant info:

*   **Vulnerable code:** The vulnerable code snippets are in  `ext/standard/string.c`.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability is caused due to `zend_string_alloc(4 * ZSTR_LEN(str), 0);` which allocates memory for the resultant string where the length is not properly handled when `ZSTR_LEN(str)` is big resulting in an Integer Overflow.
*   **Crash:** The crash occurs at `mov BYTE PTR [eax],dl`, when a byte is moved to a location after an overflow.
*   **Exploit:** The provided PoC's (2.php and 3.php) demonstrates the integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

The provided information gives more detail than the CVE description, it specifies the exact location of the vulnerable code, how integer overflows occur and trigger a heap based buffer overflow and provides proof-of-concept code.
