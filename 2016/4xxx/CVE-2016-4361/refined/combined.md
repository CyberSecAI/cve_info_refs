### Synopsis

HP LoadRunner contains multiple flaws related to packet handling that can lead to a remote DoS, or one that could possibly lead to remote code execution, although that was not tested extensively.

#1: Multiple Service Connection Request xsr\_string Field Handling NULL Pointer Dereference Remote DoS (HPSBGN03609 / CVE-2016-4361)

Affected: 11.52, 12.02. Not Affected: 12.50

Based on limited testing, since it appears to be fixed in the latest version, it is possible to trigger a NULL pointer dereference when sending the same packets to a combination of services based around `magentservice.exe` (the agent listens on multiple TCP ports including 54345, 50500, and 5003) and the `xdr_string` field in a connection request message. This was trivially reproduced by using Nessus with thorough\_tests enabled, specifically the `loadrunner_agent_detect.nasl, loadrunner_agent_service_ip_name_overflow.nasl`, and `hp_loadrunner_cve-2013-4800.nasl` plugins.

```

(cd8.ccc): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for C:\Program Files\HP\LoadRunner\launch_service\bin\launcher.dll -

```

#2: Malformed Packet Handling Remote DoS (HPSBGN03609 / CVE-2016-4361)

Affected: 9.5. Not Affected: 10.50, 12.02

A malformed packet set to TCP port 5001 or TCP port 5002 causes the crash. As of version 12.02), the service no longer listens on those ports effectively 'fixing' the issue. This can be performed using Nessus with `thorough_tests` enabled. Since fixed in the latest version, further testing was not performed.

#3: mchan.dll Packet Handling Invalid Memory Access Remote DoS (HPSBGN03648 / CVE-2016-4384)

Affected: 11.52, 12.02, 12.50

By sending a specially crafted packet to the LoadRunner agent listening on TCP port 54345, a remote attacker can crash the service. A "`-server_type=6`" request (`LinkList` server) without a "`ll_server_index=...`" declaration in a connection request triggers the invalid memory access, possibly due to `ll_server_index` being uinitialized. This has not been fully tested to determine if remote code execution is possible.

```

(658.33c): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

```

A quick note on the CVE assignments. Once both HP advisories were out, we used them to determine that the CVE assignments were not ideal. Ultimately, CVE-2016-4361 (SSRT102274) should have represented all three issues in this advisory. However, when HPSBGN03648 was published with CVE-2016-4384, looking at the affected / fixed versions tells us that represents #3. So CVE-2016-4361 would actually cover #1 and #2 in this advisory. Here is the breakdown including our internal tracking numbers:

```

CVE-2016-4359 (PSRT110020, ZDI-CAN-3516 / ZDI-16-363) = TRA-13 = TRA-2016-16
CVE-2016-4360 (PSRT110032, ZDI-CAN-3555 / ZDI-16-364) = TRA-27 = TRA-2016-17
CVE-2016-4361 (SSRT102274) = TRA-14 #1 / #2 / #3 = TRA-2016-26
CVE-2016-4384 (PSRT110230) = TRA-14 #3  = TRA-2016-26

```

We are fairly confident that HP's internal records do not match this, but since we are the ones policing a CNA for not doing proper CVE assignments and us being involved with all of these disclosures, we are clearly stating the above to be the definitive CVE assignments.

### Solution

HPE has released Performance Center v12.53 and LoadRunner v12.53 / v12.50 patch 3 to address these issues, we think. HPSBGN03648 says that "all versions prior to v12.50" are affected, implying 12.50 is the fix. However, they then say 12.50 patch 3 is the fix, implying 12.50 is vulnerable. We fully encourage you to [reach out to HP and ask them for clarity](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e4d5b5d4b4c574a47135f525b4c4a7e564e5b105d5153) if this impacts your organization.
