  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "NULL pointer dereference",
    "Malformed packet handling leading to a crash"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the affected services.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending specially crafted packets to various TCP ports used by `magentservice.exe` (54345, 50500, and 5003)",
      "Sending a malformed packet to TCP ports 5001 or 5002"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable services. No authentication is required."
