Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of input parameters within several obs-service tools, specifically when handling file names or paths. This lack of sanitization allows for code or parameter injection.  The core issue is that shell special characters within file names and paths were not properly escaped when passed to underlying shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code/Parameter Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious code or parameters into commands executed by the affected services. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization of file names or paths, allowing shell special characters to be interpreted as commands rather than literal values.
*   **Unquoted Parameters:** The scripts use unquoted parameters, leading to the injection vulnerability.
*   **Specifically, the `obs-service-extract_file` package has an issue related to executing unzip with "illegal options".**

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the system running the affected services.
*   **File System Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete files on the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability is described as having "complete" confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact if exploited. The SUSE CVSSv2 score indicates a local vector which would mean privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Service Definition:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious service definitions containing specially crafted file names or paths with injected commands or parameters.
*   **Source Directories with Malicious Filenames:**  If existing source directories have weird filenames (with shell special characters), running source services locally might put local developers at risk.
*   **Local Exploitation:** The SUSE CVSSv2 score indicates a local attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Define or Modify Service Definitions:** An attacker must be able to define or modify service definitions within the openSUSE Build Service to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Local Access (per SUSE CVSSv2):** The SUSE CVSSv2 score implies the attacker requires some level of local access, at least as a single user that can run these build services.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable services:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable services and how to craft the malicious file names or paths to inject commands.

**Affected Services:**

*   `obs-service-source_validator`
*   `obs-service-extract_file`
*   `obs-service-download_files`
*   `obs-service-recompress`
*   `obs-service-verify_file`
*   `obs-service-format_spec_file` (mentioned as affected in a bugzilla comment)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise products.
*   The fix involves properly quoting parameters and sanitizing input in the affected services.
*   The bug report also mentions an additional non-security issue related to uninitialized values in `obs-service-source_validator`.
