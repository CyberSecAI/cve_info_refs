Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the fact that Glance, the OpenStack image service, does not maintain a persistent list of previously used image IDs. When an image is deleted, its ID is marked as deleted in the `images` table, but these records can be removed by the `glance-manage db purge` utility or manually by an administrator for performance reasons. This removal makes the image ID available for reuse.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Image ID Reassignment:** The core weakness is that deleted image IDs can be reassigned to new images. This breaks the immutability promise of Glance, where an image ID should always refer to the same image data.
*   **Lack of Tracking:** Glance does not track previously used image IDs after deletion, allowing their reuse.
*   **`glance-manage db purge` Utility:** This tool exacerbates the issue by providing a method to remove the soft-deleted records, effectively making the IDs available for reuse.
*   **Image Creation with Specified ID:** Glance allows image creators to optionally specify the image ID, which a malicious actor can abuse.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Corruption/Substitution:** A user (Alice) might boot a VM from an image (ID X) that was originally shared by Bob. If Bob deletes the image and Mallory creates a new image also with ID X, sharing it with Alice (or making it public if permitted by policies), the subsequent boot of Alice's VM will use Mallory's image instead of the original image, potentially leading to unexpected data changes, and possibly malicious code execution within Alice's instance.
*   **Loss of Trust:** The immutability promise of images is broken, creating uncertainty and potential data inconsistencies.
*   **Unintended State Changes:** Instances that boot from a re-used ID will be running an image with different content from what was expected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Image ID Reuse:** An attacker (Mallory) creates a new image and specifies the same ID as a previously deleted image.
*   **Image Sharing:** The attacker then shares the image with a user who previously used the original image (Alice) or uses public images feature if available.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Glance:** The attacker needs to be able to create images in the Glance service.
*   **Knowledge of Deleted Image IDs:** The attacker needs to be aware of image IDs that have been deleted and purged from the database.
*   **Ability to Share or Publish:** The attacker needs to have the ability to share their malicious image with the victim, or to publicize it if allowed by the cloud's configuration.
*   **Privileged access** (e.g. admin access) is not required if image creation is not limited to trusted users and if the environment allows non-administrators to publish images.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue affects Glance versions from Liberty onwards.
*   The recommended action is to avoid purging the `images` table in environments where normal users can upload images. It is safe to delete rows from other related tables (`image_properties`, `image_tags`, `image_members`, and `image_locations`).
*   A fix has been implemented in the Rocky release by adding a table to track deleted IDs.
