# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0181

## Apple Image I/O EXR Compression Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 18, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-4630

### SUMMARY

An exploitable heap based buffer overflow exists in the handling of EXR images on OS X. A crafted EXR document can lead to a heap based buffer overflow resulting in remote code execution. Vulnerability can be triggered via a saved EXR file delivered by other means when opened in any application using the Apple Image I/O API.

### TESTED VERSIONS

OSX El Capitan - 10.11.4

### PRODUCT URLs

https://developer.apple.com/osx/download

### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

### DETAILS

This vulnerability is present in the Apple Image I/O API which is used for all image handling on OS X including rendering images in Preview.

There exists a vulnerability in the parsing and handling of EXR images. A specially crafted EXR image file can lead to an out of bounds write and ultimately to remote code execution.

OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications and is used in all motion pictures currently in production. EXR uses 16-bit floating-point color component values. Since the IEEE-754 floating-point specification does not define a 16-bit format, EXR created the “half” format. Half values have 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, and 10 mantissa bits. This information is then read in as rows of x and y coordinates to draw the image. The vulnerability arises when the values read in are not properly sanitized.

EXR includes support for multiple different compression formats. B44 compression is used in this case and ultimately leads to the vulnerability. Below is the crash that happens when running the trigger:

```
```

 ```

```

And running the trigger again except with guard malloc enabled this time shows us some interesting output:

```
```
GuardMalloc[Preview-98952]: Attempting excessively large memory allocation:  687194773760 bytes
GuardMalloc[Preview-98952]: If you really wanted to allocate so much memory, launch your executable with the environment variable MALLOC_PERMIT_INSANE_REQUESTS set to any value to circumvent this check.
GuardMalloc[Preview-98952]: Explicitly trapping into debugger!!!
```

```

The large malloc is caused by a user controlled value for the size of the compressed B44 data. This pointer ultimately gets stored in an int despite the fact that it is the size of long. This ultimately causes truncation of the malloced value leading to an out of bounds access. This is a direct memcpy of user controlled data into an out of bounds buffer and could be leveraged to gain full remote code execution.
