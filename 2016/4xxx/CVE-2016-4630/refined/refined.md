Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-4630

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow during the processing of EXR image files, specifically within the Apple Image I/O API.
- The issue occurs when handling B44 compressed data within an EXR file. The size of the compressed data is controlled by a user-supplied value.
- The code improperly handles this user-controlled size by truncating the value, which is the size of a long, into an integer resulting in an out-of-bounds memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The core issue is the heap buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the allocated memory space.
- **Integer Truncation:** A user-controlled value for compressed data size gets truncated, which leads to an incorrect memory allocation.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code fails to properly sanitize the user-provided data, allowing an attacker to control the size of the memory allocation and the amount of data written into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious EXR File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted EXR image file.
- **Image I/O API:** The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses the vulnerable Apple Image I/O API to process the malicious EXR image. This includes any application using Apple's image processing libraries such as the Preview application, or any third party software.
- **File Delivery:** The malicious file can be delivered through various means including email, web downloads, or other file sharing methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to deliver a crafted EXR file:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious EXR file to a system that will process it using the vulnerable Image I/O API.
- **No Special User Privileges Required:** The vulnerability does not require any special user privileges to be triggered.
- **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious file using a vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Apple Image I/O API, affecting multiple applications that use this API for image handling.
- The vulnerability has been tested on OSX El Capitan - 10.11.4.
- The provided crash information indicates that the vulnerability occurs within `libOpenEXR.dylib` during the uncompression of the B44 compressed data and within `libsystem_platform.dylib` when `memmove` is called with invalid arguments.
-  The vulnerability was patched by Apple in OS X El Capitan v10.11.6 and Security Update 2016-004.
