Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the MS-WSP dissector of Wireshark. This dissector is responsible for parsing the Microsoft Wireless Session Protocol (MS-WSP). The issue stems from the dissector's inability to properly handle malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed packets within the MS-WSP dissector. This suggests a lack of proper input validation or boundary checks when parsing the protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash. This can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions for users analyzing network traffic or packet capture files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Packet Injection:** An attacker could inject a crafted, malformed MS-WSP packet onto the network. If a user running a vulnerable version of Wireshark captures and analyzes this traffic, it would trigger the crash.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker could create a malicious packet capture (pcap) file containing a malformed MS-WSP packet. If a user opens this file with a vulnerable version of Wireshark, it would trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto a network that a user is monitoring with Wireshark, or the ability to convince a user to open a malicious pcap file. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim if they use the malicious pcap file attack vector.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.2.
- The fix was implemented in Wireshark version 2.0.3.
- The issue was originally tracked as Wireshark issue 12341.
- CVE-2016-4083 is related, but the content provided does not specify the differences in the vulnerability.
