- **Root Cause:** A heap overflow vulnerability exists in Hancom Hangul HCell due to an index miscalculation when processing chart formula data within the "Workbook" stream of a .cell document. The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking when incrementing an index used to write into a buffer for formulae, specifically within the `CFormulaTokenSizeModifier` object in `HCellBook.dll`.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - **Heap Overflow:** The application does not properly validate the index used for writing formula data, allowing it to write outside of allocated buffer, leading to a heap overflow.
    - **Incorrect Type Casting:** A 32-bit pointer is incorrectly treated as a 16-bit value when determining the current position in the buffer.
    - **Lack of Bounds Checking:**  There's an absence of checks to ensure that index increments remain within the allocated buffer for formulas.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - **Malicious Document:** The attack is triggered by opening a specially crafted Hangul Hcell document (.cell file).
    - **Specific Record Parsing:** The vulnerability occurs when processing a specific record (type 0x7ef0) within the "Workbook" stream that contains chart data.
    - **Formula Data Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the formula data to cause a write outside of the CFormulaTokenSizeModifier object's buffer.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Crafted Document:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious .cell file.
    - **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the crafted document using the vulnerable application.
    - **Knowledge of Format:** The attacker needs knowledge of the Hangul Hcell document format and the structure of records within the Workbook stream.
