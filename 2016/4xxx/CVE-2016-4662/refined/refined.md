- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability in `AppleGraphicsControl` that allows for arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An application exploiting the memory corruption issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute an application on the target system.
