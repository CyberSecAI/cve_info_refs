At the time of this announcement, Splunk is not aware of any cases where these vulnerabilities have been actively exploited. Previous Product Security Announcements can be found on our Splunk Product Security Portal. Use SPL numbers when referencing issues in communication with Splunk. If there is no Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier listed with a vulnerability, it will be added once it is assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority. To standardize the calculation of severity scores for each vulnerability, when appropriate, Splunk uses Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 2 (CVSS v2).
