Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4857:

**Verification:**
The JVN entry explicitly states that CVE-2016-4857 is related to an open redirect vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Light. This aligns with the Splunk advisory which mentions an open redirect vulnerability in Splunk Web, referencing the same affected versions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an open redirect vulnerability in Splunk Web. This means the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to manipulate it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of redirect URLs, which allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website.
- This could be leveraged for phishing attacks, where users are tricked into providing sensitive information on a fake website controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL.
- The user is tricked into clicking on this malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the manipulated redirect.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to perform the attack.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click on the malicious URL through social engineering or other techniques.

**Additional Details:**
