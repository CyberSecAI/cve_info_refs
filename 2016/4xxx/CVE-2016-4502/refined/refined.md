The provided content is related to CVE-2016-4502.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The device supports different accounts with varying system privileges. An attacker can gain access to functions not displayed in the user's menu by brute-forcing parameters. This is due to improper privilege management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-264):** The system does not properly restrict access to functions based on user privileges, allowing unauthorized access to privileged functions through parameter manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to functions not normally available to a user, potentially allowing unauthorized actions within the system.
*   An attacker could gain access to sensitive information or make unauthorized changes, though the specific impact (beyond information access) is not detailed

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   Attackers can use brute-force parameter manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   Low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction is required.
