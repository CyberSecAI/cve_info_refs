{
  "cve": "CVE-2016-4454",
  "description": "The QEMU VMWare VGA module incorrectly handled the FIFO buffer. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly to obtain sensitive host memory.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the vmsvga_fifo_read_raw() routine of the QEMU VMWare VGA module. It was found that sanity checks on the FIFO buffer were not performed every time QEMU reads from the FIFO but only when the FIFO is enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Lack of proper FIFO buffer validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside the guest can exploit this vulnerability to leak host memory bytes or crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Guest OS",
      "VMWare VGA module interaction"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A privileged user within the guest operating system is required to exploit this vulnerability."
  },
    "patch": "The fix moves the FIFO sanity checks to the vmsvga_fifo_length function, which is called each time QEMU reads from the FIFO. This ensures that the FIFO registers are valid before any data is read, preventing out-of-bounds reads and potential crashes."
