- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the Kaspersky Internet Security KLIF driver's syscall filtering functionality, specifically in how it handles the `NtUserCreateWindowEx` syscall. The driver attempts to validate user-provided pointers but only checks the first 4 bytes for user-space access and readability. It then attempts to dereference a dword at offset +0x8 of the pointer without prior validation which can cause an access violation.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient pointer validation in the KLIF driver when handling `NtUserCreateWindowEx` system calls. Specifically, the driver checks if a pointer is in user space and readable for the first 4 bytes, but doesn't validate the subsequent 4 bytes before attempting to read it.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a local denial of service (DoS). The access violation in the kernel driver crashes the system.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `NtUserCreateWindowEx` call. This involves manipulating either the `arg_8_plstrClsVersion` or `arg_C_plstrWindowName` arguments of the syscall to point to a memory location where the offset +0x8 is not accessible. The exploit can be triggered by running a program from user mode.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to execute code locally on the system where Kaspersky Internet Security is installed.
