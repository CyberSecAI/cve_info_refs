Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Reader DC handles XPath expressions within PDF documents, specifically within the `apply-templates` element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A specially crafted PDF document with a specific `apply-templates` element and an XPath expression can force Adobe Reader DC to write values beyond the allocated memory buffer. This is a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running Adobe Reader DC). This can lead to complete system compromise if the user is running with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Document:** The primary attack vector is a crafted PDF document containing a malicious `apply-templates` element with a crafted XPath expression.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, as the target user must either open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted PDF:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF with the specific `apply-templates` and XPath expression that causes the out-of-bounds write.
*   **Delivery Mechanism:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the PDF to the victim, such as email, a web download, or social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC
*   The vulnerability is addressed by Adobe's security update released on July 7, 2016, as detailed in APSB16-26. The update patches multiple vulnerabilities including this one.
* The vulnerability is specifically a memory corruption type vulnerability that could lead to remote code execution, and is classified as a critical vulnerability.
