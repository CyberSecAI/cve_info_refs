- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cybozu Garoon groupware lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352) exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a logged-in user visits a malicious page, the attacker can force the user to log out of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based, requiring the user to visit a malicious page controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious page and trick a logged-in user to visit it. No prior authentication is needed to launch the attack.
