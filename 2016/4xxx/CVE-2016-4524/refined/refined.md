- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficiently protected credentials. Specifically, OPC Server IEC61850 authentication passwords are temporarily stored insecurely.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Credentials for the OPC Server IEC61850 authentication are stored insecurely.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to the PCM600 application and connected devices. There is a potential for information disclosure and limited impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the PC running PCM600 is required. User interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the PC running the PCM600 software, and needs to initiate user interaction.
