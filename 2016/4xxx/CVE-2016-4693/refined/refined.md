The provided documents describe security updates for watchOS, macOS, and iOS, and include details for CVE-2016-4693.

**CVE-2016-4693**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from weaknesses present in the 3DES cryptographic algorithm.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core issue is the susceptibility of 3DES to cryptographic attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit the weaknesses within 3DES.
*  **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers who are in a position to intercept and manipulate encrypted communications that utilize 3DES.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and potentially manipulate communications using the 3DES cryptographic algorithm, typically through a privileged network position.

The fix was to remove 3DES as a default cipher.

This vulnerability is present in:
* watchOS 3.1.3
* macOS Sierra 10.12.2, Security Update 2016-003 El Capitan, and Security Update 2016-007 Yosemite
* iOS 10.2
