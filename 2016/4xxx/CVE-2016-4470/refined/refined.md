Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2016-4470:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `key_reject_and_link` function in `security/keys/key.c` within the Linux kernel does not properly ensure a specific data structure is initialized. This lack of initialization occurs when an error condition arises during the `__key_link_begin()` function call, which is then followed by `__key_link_end()` which leads to usage of uninitialized pointer(s) which can then be freed, resulting in use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper initialization of memory structures, which can be abused by a local user.
- Improper error handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (system crash)
- Potential privilege escalation

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attacker with the ability to create a specially crafted `keyctl request2` command that triggers the error condition that leads to the uninitialized memory being accessed via `key_reject_and_link`.
- Local users with some access to /proc file system

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user access to the system.
- Ability to craft a specific `keyctl request2` command.
- For RHEL 5/6 systems , the attacker needs to exploit the ptrace method as /proc/self/mem isn't writable out of the box, for those systems.
