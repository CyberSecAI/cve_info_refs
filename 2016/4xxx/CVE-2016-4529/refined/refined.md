Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-4529

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an untrusted pointer dereference within the `SetDataIntf` method of the `AxEditGrid` ActiveX control. The control blindly calls a memory address supplied by the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The ActiveX control dereferences a pointer supplied by the attacker without proper validation.
- **Unsafe ActiveX Control Marked Safe-for-Scripting:** The control is marked as "safe for scripting" which makes it available to run in the context of a webpage, even though it's not actually safe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system under the context of the process running the vulnerable control. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, enabling an attacker to take control of the machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation is possible.
- User interaction is required, where a target user must visit a malicious website or open a malicious file containing the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious webpage or file to the target user.
- The attacker must be able to supply a malicious memory address that will be dereferenced by the vulnerable control.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, as they are exploiting a vulnerability in the way the ActiveX control processes user-provided data and can be reached through a website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Schneider Electric's SoMachine HVAC software, specifically version 2.0.2 and earlier.
- The vendor has released a patch in version 2.1.0 to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Andrea Micalizzi and reported through the Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSS v2 base score is 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) while the CVSS v3 base score is 7.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
