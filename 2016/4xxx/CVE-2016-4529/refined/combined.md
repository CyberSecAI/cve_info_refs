## Schneider Electric SoMachine HVAC AxEditGrid ActiveX Control SetDataIntf Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-16-440ZDI-CAN-3581

| CVE ID | [CVE-2016-4529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4529) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Schneider Electric](http://www.schneider-electric.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | SoMachine HVAC |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric SoMachine HVAC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the SetDataIntf method of the AxEditGrid control. The control has an untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability because it blindly calls an attacker-supplied memory address. A remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Schneider Electric has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

<http://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2016-161-01>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
