## Summary

Possible DoS attack when using `URLValidator`

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Possible DoS attack when using URLValidator |
| Maximum security rating | Low |
| Recommendation | Upgrade to [Struts 2.3.29](/confluence/display/WW/Version%2BNotes%2B2.3.29) or [Struts 2.5.13](/confluence/display/WW/Version%2BNotes%2B2.5.13) |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.3.20 - 2.3.28.1  Struts 2.5 - 2.5.12 |
| Reporter | ASAI Ken tc535mr2 at gmail dot com |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2016-4465 |

## Problem

If an application allows enter na URL field in a form and built-in `URLValidator` is used, it is possible to prepare a special URL which will be used to overload server process when performing validation of the URL.

## Solution

Upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.3.29 or 2.5.13.

## Backward compatibility

No backward incompatibility issues are expected.

## Workaround

You can redefine RegEx used by `URLValidator` as below:

```
<validator type="url">
    <param name="fieldName">myHomePage</param>
    <param name="urlRegex">^(https?|ftp):\\/\\/(([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;\\?&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})+(:([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;\\?&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})+)?@)?(#?)((([a-z0-9]\\.|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]\\.)*[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]|((\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\\.){3}(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5]))(:\\d+)?)(((\\/{0,1}([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)*(\\?([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)?)?)?(#([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)?$</param>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1348253#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-20 14:48:49 UTC  ``` If an application allows enter na URL field in a form and built-in URLValidator is used, it is possible to prepare a special URL which will be used to overload server process when performing validation of the URL.  Affected versions: Struts 2.3.20 - Struts 2.3.28.1 and Struts 2.5  External References:  <https://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-041.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1348253#c1)  gil cattaneo    2016-06-20 14:53:15 UTC  ``` thanks for the information, but I remove from the CC list.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1348253#c3)  Chess Hazlett    2019-09-17 20:23:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  A previous statement by Red Hat related to this CVE, prior to August 2019, said that Apache Struts 2 is not included in any Red Hat products. This earlier statement was incorrect. While Struts 2 is not actively compiled, shipped, used, or enabled in any Red Hat provided final products, and does not cause any vulnerability in the product, struts2-core jars have been included in some products' source code packages. The inclusion was part of an import of the Google Guice repository, which includes struts2-core. Customers that build artefacts from our source code could be at risk. Red Hat will remove these artefacts from source code in future releases.  The products that included the Struts 2 artefacts in their source jars: Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 Single Sign On 7.3.0+  If you have used the source package from one of these products to build artefacts on your system, you should do the following to remove potentially affected jars: 1. Run 'find . -name struts2*.jar' under the source location 2. Remove any files found This will not affect the product, as the jar is included with the source of google-guice, but no functionality requiring struts2 is implemented.   ``` |  |
