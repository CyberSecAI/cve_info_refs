# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache Struts affect SAN Volume Controller, Storwize family and FlashSystem V9000 products

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Open Source Apache Struts vulnerabilities were disclosed in Jun 2016. Struts is used by SAN Volume Controller, Storwize family and FlashSystem V9000 products in their Service Assistant GUI. The CVEs are CVE-2016-4430 CVE-2016-4431 CVE-2016-4433 CVE-2016-4436.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-4430](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4430) Apache Struts is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. By persuading an authenticated user to visit a malicious Web site, a remote attacker could send a malformed expression to bypass token validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site scripting attacks, Web cache poisoning, and other malicious activities.

## Summary

Getter as action method leads to security bypass

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Possible manipulation of return result and bypassing validation |
| Maximum security rating | Moderate |
| Recommendation | Upgrade to [Struts 2.3.29](/confluence/display/WW/Version%2BNotes%2B2.3.29). |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.3.20 - Struts Struts 2.3.28.1 |
| Reporter | Takeshi Terada websec02 dot g02 at gmail.com |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2016-4433 |

## Problem

It is possible to pass a crafted request which can be used to bypass internal security mechanism and manipulate return string which can leads to redirecting user to unvalidated location.

## Solution

Upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.3.29.

## Backward compatibility

Some backward incompatibility issues are expected when upgrading to Struts 2.3.29 - it can happen that some OGNL expressions stop working because of performing disallowed arithmetic operations and assignments.

## Workaround

You can try to use more restrictive RegEx used to clean up action names as below:

```
<constant name="struts.allowed.action.names" value="[a-zA-Z]*" />
```

Please adjust the RegEx to your action naming pattern, it should be as narrowed as possible.

This earlier statement was incorrect. While Struts 2 is not actively compiled, shipped, used, or enabled in any Red Hat provided final products, and does not cause any vulnerability in the product, struts2-core jars have been included in some products' source code packages. The inclusion was part of an import of the Google Guice repository, which includes struts2-core. Customers that build artefacts from our source code could be at risk. Red Hat will remove these artefacts from source code in future releases.  The products that included the Struts 2 artefacts in their source jars: Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 Single Sign On 7.3.0+  If you have used the source package from one of these products to build artefacts on your system, you should do the following to remove potentially affected jars: 1. Run 'find . -name struts2*.jar' under the source location 2. Remove any files found This will not affect the product, as the jar is included with the source of google-guice, but no functionality requiring struts2 is implemented.   ``` |  |

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

[Update: June 30, 2016]

~~The developer has stated that CVE-2016-4433 (S2-039) has been [addressed in Struts 2.3.39](http://struts.apache.org/docs/s2-039.html). However the reporter and JPCERT/CC have each confirmed that the fix is insufficient and that arbitrary code can be executed in Struts 2.3.29 by exploiting CVE-2016-4433 (S2-039). JPCERT/CC is currently in contact with the vendor.~~

[Update: August 25, 2016]

CVE-2016-4433 (S2-039) has been addressed in Struts 2.3.29, although the vendor has confirmed that similar issues still exist. According to the developer, these issues will be addressed in a future release.
