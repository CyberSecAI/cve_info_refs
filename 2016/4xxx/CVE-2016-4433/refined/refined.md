Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4433:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an error in the "Getter as action" method within Apache Struts. This allows an attacker to bypass internal security mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Security Restriction Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to circumvent security restrictions due to the flawed getter action method.
- **Input Validation Error:**  There is improper input validation in the getter method, which allows crafted requests to manipulate the return string and perform actions like redirecting users to arbitrary sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirects to Unvalidated Locations:** Attackers can redirect users to arbitrary and potentially malicious websites.
- **Manipulation of Return Results:** The vulnerability allows manipulation of return values, potentially leading to other unintended actions.
- **Unintended Operations:** Attackers can induce users to perform unintended actions by manipulating the flow of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is launched remotely over the network.
- **Specially Crafted Requests:** The attacker sends a specially crafted request to exploit the vulnerable "Getter as action" method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** An attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to formulate specific, malicious requests that target the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is identified as S2-039 in the Apache Struts documentation.
- It affects Apache Struts versions 2.3.20 to 2.3.28.1.
- The issue was initially reported by Takeshi Terada.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Struts 2.3.29, however, there were initial reports of the fix being insufficient.
- A workaround to mitigate the vulnerability was to use more restrictive Regular Expressions to clean up action names.
- The issue was also present in IBM SAN Volume Controller, Storwize family and FlashSystem V9000 products.
