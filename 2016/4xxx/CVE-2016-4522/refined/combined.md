ICS Advisory
# Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-173-03

## OVERVIEW

This advisory was originally posted to the US-CERT secure Portal library on June 21, 2016, and is being released to the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site.

Rockwell Automation has identified authentication vulnerabilities in the FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix application. Rockwell Automation has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix versions are affected:

* FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix, Version 2.10.00 and prior versions.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may give unauthenticated access to the affected system.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Rockwell Automation, which is a US-based company, provides industrial automation control and information products worldwide across a wide range of industries.

The affected product, FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix, is a web-enabled management software package that captures, analyzes, stores, and shares energy data. According to Rockwell Automation, the product is deployed across several sectors, including Chemical, Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Government Facilities, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Rockwell Automation estimates that the product is used worldwide.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### INSUFFICIENT SESSION EXPIRATIONCWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/613.html, web site last accessed July 26, 2016.

User credentials are not immediately invalidated after an explicit logout action is performed by the user, which may allow an attacker to use these credentials until reset.

CVE-2016-4531NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4531, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, web site last accessed July 26, 2016.

### SQL INJECTIONCWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html, web site last accessed July 26, 2016.

An anonymous user may be able to escalate privileges resulting in privileged access to the application and its data files but not to the underlying computer system. The impact of this vulnerability is highly dependent on the user’s environment and the level of privilege the web server service account has with its associated database.

CVE-2016-4522NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4522, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, web site last accessed July 26, 2016.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Rockwell Automation has released Version 2.20.00 and Version 2.30.00, which both address the identified vulnerabilities. Rockwell Automation recommends that FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix users install Version 2.30.00 or the latest version.

Rockwell Automation’s new versions, Version 2.20.00 and Version 2.30.00, are available at the following URL, with a valid account:

<http://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?famID=1&crumb=112>

In addition to applying the latest software version, Rockwell Automation recommends applying the following additional mitigations, when possible:

* Ensure that the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with the minimum amount of rights that are needed.
* Configure and enable HTTPS on your FactoryTalk EnergyMetrix server, which will help protect the confidentiality and integrity of information exchanged between the web browser and server.
* Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments.
* Employ training and awareness programs to educate users on the warning signs of a phishing or social engineering attack.

Rockwell Automation’s security notification is available at the following URL with a valid account:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/866393>

ICS-CERT recommends, as quality assurance, that users test the update in a test development environment that reflects their production environment prior to installation. In addition, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at*:*[http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies*.*](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
