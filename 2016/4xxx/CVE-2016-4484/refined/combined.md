# CVE-2016-4484

| **Name** | CVE-2016-4484 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The Debian initrd script for the cryptsetup package 2:1.7.3-2 and earlier allows physically proximate attackers to gain shell access via many log in attempts with an invalid password. |

6. [Discussion.](#disc)
## Description

A vulnerability in **Cryptsetup**, concretely in the scripts
that unlock the system partition when the partition is ciphered
using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup). The disclosure of this
vulnerability was presented as part of our talk "**Abusing LUKS
to Hack the System**" in the DeepSec 2016 security conference,
Vienna.

This vulnerability allows to obtain a root initramfs
shell on affected systems. The vulnerability is very reliable
because it doesn't depend on specific systems or configurations.
Attackers can copy, modify or destroy the hard disc as well as set
up the network to exflitrate data. This vulnerability is specially
serious in environments like libraries, ATMs, airport machines,
labs, etc, where the whole boot process is protect (password in
BIOS and GRUB) and we only have a keyboard or/and a mouse.

Note that in **cloud environments** it is also possible to
remotely exploit this vulnerability without having "physical
access."

**UPDATE 17/11/2016**

The bug is in the initrd scripts used for decrypting a system
volume. Initrd contains stripts from multiple services, and the
affected one is an script file from the cryptsetup Debian package.

#### Regarding physical access

In general when the attackers have "physical access" then it is
"game over". But there are different degrees "physical
access". It is not the same to attack a system with only a
small-reduced keyboard (entertainment airplane) than a system
where the attacker can access to the USB or other ports; or there
may be a huge difference between having access to a keyboard with
or without the [ESC] key.
#### Remotely exploitable in cloud environments

According to CVSSv3 "remotely exploitable" (or network attack
vector) means that the vulnerable component is bound to the
network stack. But we also believe that cloud is changing the
rules of everything, from the hardware to the operating systems.

The CVSS v3 standard (an admirable normalization effort) defines
4 coarse-grain levels
of [attack vectors](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#i2.1.1): Network, Adjacent, Local and
Physical. But as far as we know, there are some cloud
environments that provide full console access over the
network. We tried to reflect that cloud environments are not
100% safe, and they should not ignore this
vulnerability. Depending on the service offered by some cloud
providers they could be vulnerable, and so, it is not clear in
which attack vector fits better.

Security is still a young field which tries to adapt to the
continuous changes of the technology. Cloud computing is
redefining many computing concepts.

Please, read the "Discussion: About physical access" at the end of
this blog.
#### Other systems affected by a similar (or the same) issue

* Systems that use **Dracut** instead
  of initramfs are also vulnerable. (tested on Fedora 24 x86\_64).
  Note that if the grub password is setted at installation time on
  Fedora the **rd.shell** is set to zero preventing this
  attack. Thanks to Lubomir for reporting this.
* The **kinitram** simple and powerful initram system is also
  vulnerable. Thanks to Klondike for letting us know.
### Am I vulnerable ?

**If you use Debian** or Ubuntu/ (probably many derived distributions
are also vulnerable, but we have not tested), **and you have
encrypted the system partition**, then your systems is vulnerable.

![](install-ubuntu-luks.png)

During the installation of Ubuntu, one of the first steps is to
prepare the target partition (make partitions if needed, and/or
format them). At this stage, the user is asked to "Encrypt the new
(LXK)ubuntu installation for security". Nowadays, there is very little
performance penalty working with an encrypted disk and it
is an effective solution to protect data when the computer
is not running. It is advisable to enable this feature.

If you didn't installed the system, the you can figure out the
organization by running the blkid command.
Checking if the root partition is encrypted
```
$ blkid
/dev/sda1: UUID="db96cdf9-99c3-4239-95f2-6af2651ef3ac" TYPE="ext2"
/dev/sda5: UUID="d491bf52-a9ea-466f-be9b-3a5df954699e" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
/dev/mapper/sda5_crypt: UUID="30xz0y-4LeG-LwuL-QHI9-pWWi-BxHf-F3udoC" TYPE="LVM2_member"
/dev/mapper/lubuntu--vg-root: UUID="53f95bd1-9e1c-4e23-9ff3-990d90c5cc92" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/mapper/lubuntu--vg-swap_1: UUID="9eac532c-1b54-4cac-9995-b4b921222422" TYPE="swap"
/dev/zram0: UUID="c2929c6e-2432-40ee-99a5-deadbeefa53e" TYPE="swap"
/dev/zram1: UUID="d1bf1e22-dead-beef-9c49-e6462449d6e2" TYPE="swap"
/dev/zram2: UUID="12a9232d-c62e-0df6-93ea-22ac3600bdf0" TYPE="swap"
/dev/zram3: UUID="bf777ad3-13fc-4ad5-914b-002e67262939" TYPE="swap"
```

This is the classic structure where the partition
"/dev/sda5" is encrypted and then used as a
physical\_volume in the "lubuntu-vg" volume\_group which
contains two logical\_volumes: lubuntu--vg-root
and lubuntu--vg-swap\_1. As a result, the system and the
swap partitions are encrypted by LUKS and protected by a single
password. This system is vulnerable.

## Impact

An attacker with access to the console of the computer and with
the ability to reboot the computer can launch a shell (with root
permissions) when he/she is prompted for the password to unlock
the system partition. The shell is executed in the initrd
environment. Obviously, **the system partition is encrypted**
and it is not possible to decrypt it (AFAWK). But other
partitions may be not encrypted, and so accessible. Just to
mention some exploitation strategies:

* **Elevation of privilege:** Since the boot partition is
  typically not encrypted:
  + It can be used to store an executable file with the bit
    SetUID enabled. Which can later be used to escalate
    privileges by a local user.
  + If the boot is not secured, then it would be possible to
    replace the kernel and the initrd image.
* **Information disclosure:** It is possible to access all
  the disks. Although the system partition is encrypted it can
  be copied to an external device, where it can be later be
  brute forced. Obviously, it is possible to access to
  non-encrypted information in other devices.
* **Denial of service:**
  The attacker can delete the information on all the disks.

## The Vulnerability

The fault is caused by an incorrect handling of the password
check in the script file /scripts/local-top/cryptroot. When
the user exceeds the maximum number of password tries (by
default 3), then boot sequence continues normally.

The calling
script, /scripts/local, handles the error as if it were
caused by a slow device that needs more time to warm-up.

The booting scripts then tries to recover/mount the "failing"
device, in the function local\_deveice\_setup(), multiple
times (up to 30 times on an x86 system, and 150 on a powerpc
machine). Every time the top level script tries to mount the
encrypted partition (line 99 in /script/local), the
user is allowed to try 3 more LUKS passwords. This gives a total
of 93 password trials (on x86).

128}
. . .
```

But the real problem happens when the maximum number of trials
for transient hardware faults is reached (30 times for non ppc
systems), line 114 at function local\_device\_setup().
In this case, the top level script is not aware of the root
cause of the fault and **drops a shell** (busybox) to the
user, line 124. The panic() function (see below) tries
to insert additional drivers and runs a shell.

## The Exploit (PoC)

The attacker just have to press and keep pressing the [Enter]
key at the LUKS password prompt until a shell appears, which
occurs after 70 seconds approx.

## The fix

The issue can be easily fixed by stopping the boot sequence when
the number of password guesses has been exhausted. The following
patch suspends the execution forever. The only way to exit is by
rebooting the computer.

### Workaround

The panic function, which is the one that launches the
shell, can prevent console access if the kernel is booted with
the "panic" parameter.
initram:/scripts/functions
```
69panic()
70{
71        if command -v chvt >/dev/null 2>&1; then
72                chvt 1
73        fi
74
75        echo "$@"

76        # Disallow console access
77        if [ -n "${panic}" ]; then
78                echo "Rebooting automatically due to panic= boot argument"
79                sleep ${panic}
80                reboot
81                exit  # in case reboot fails, force kernel panic
82        fi
83        modprobe -v i8042 || true
84        modprobe -v atkbd || true
85        modprobe -v ehci-pci || true
86        modprobe -v ehci-orion || true
87        modprobe -v ehci-hcd || true
88        modprobe -v uhci-hcd || true
89        modprobe -v ohci-hcd || true
90        modprobe -v usbhid || true
91
92        run_scripts /scripts/panic
93
94        REASON="$@" PS1='(initramfs) ' /bin/sh -i </dev/console >/dev/console 2>&1
95}
```

Therefore, adding the "panic" parameter to the kernel entry in the
grub configuration will prevent a shell.

Adding "panic" to the Linux command line.
```

# sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="panic=5 /' /etc/default/grub
# grub-install
```
## Discussion

The direct cause of this vulnerability is the improper checking
of the maximum number of passwords, but the bug was (probably)
introduced by the addition of new features (in this case
security features). It is well known that "*Complexity is the
worst enemy of security*". A system with more features
requires more code and has more interactions between
sub-systems, which results in harder to test systems and so more
bugs.

**Security is a non-functional requirement which must be
analyzed globally**. In this case, the "recovery" actions
taken in the case of system errors should be revised and
updated to match the security requirements.

### About physical access

It is common to assume that once
the attacker has physical access to the computer, the game is
over. The attackers can do whatever they want. And although
this was true 30 years ago, today it is not.

There are many "*levels*" of physical access. Just to mention a few:

* Access to the internal parts of the computer. The
  attacker can remove or replace the disk, ram, insert new
  devices, etc. For example, your own computer.
* Access to all the interfaces. The attacker can plug a
  USB, Ethernet, HDML or Firewire device. For example, the
  computers used to provide network access in public
  facilities.
* Access to the front interfaces. Typically, the USB and
  the keyboard. For example, Some systems to print your
  photos.
* Access to the keyboard and mouse/touchpad. For example,
  tourist information points, or the electronic check-in
  services in the airports.
* Access to a limited keyboard or other simple user
  interface. Like a smart doorbell.

These are some of the scenarios where we can find a
Linux system, but the IoT will increase the diversity further.

In order to protect the computer in these scenarios: the
BIOS/UEFI has one or two passwords to protect the booting or
the configuration menu; the GRUB also has the possibility to
use multiple passwords to protect unauthorized operations.

And in the case of an encrypted system, the initrd shall block the
maximum number of password trials and prevent the access to the
computer in that case.

### About default configuration

In general, the GNU/Linux ecosystem (kernel, system apps, distros,
...) has been designed by developers for developers. Therefore, in
the case of a fault, the recovery action is very "developer
friendly", which is very convenient while developing or in controlled
environments. But then Linux is used in more hostile environments,
this helpful (but naive) recovery services shall not be the default
option.

UEFI and GRUB contain two complete and very powerful shell
facilities. Initrd system has powerful busybox with complete access to
the network.

May be all this "just in case" functionality shall be remove, or
seriously reconsidered, for the sake of security.

This wording appears to have caused a lot of misunderstanding.  afaict,
the binary executable 'cryptsetup' has nothing to do with this bug.
Rather, it is completely in the initrd's script for decrypting a
partition containing the rootfs.

On Debian based systems, the initrd script is in the cryptsetup package,
but if one looks at the upstream repository for cryptsetup:

  <https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup.git>

There are no initrd scripts provided.  So, this is in distro-provided
scripting.  *Not* in cryptsetup [0].

We could argue that those scripts should be in a 'cryptsetup-initramfs'
package by itself, but Debian has their way of doing things, and I'm not
volunteering, so... :-P

How does this differ from an attacker setting 'init=/bin/sh' on the
kernel command line?  Or, booting from attacker provided media?  Or, in
OS X, booting in single user mode?

Your Discussion section at the end mentions facilities (GRUB passwords,
BIOS passwords, etc) for preventing this "Developer friendliness".  How
do you envision the installer enabling these while providing a failsafe
that an attacker can't exploit?

> In cloud environments it is also possible to remotely exploit this

This is straining to add 'cloud' and 'remotely exploit' into this
summary.  I presume all cloud providers who also provide console access
to VM bootup also protect that access behind user credentials or ssh
keys...

On a side note, I recommend encrypting the *entire* internal hard disk,
and configuring the BIOS/UEFI to boot from USB.  Then, put grub, /boot,
and the LUKS header on the USB drive.  Which you keep on your physical
keychain.  After boot is complete, you should be able to remove the USB
drive.  Just make sure to plug it back in during system updates. ;-)

thx,

Jason.

[0] note: the authors of cryptsetup have since updated their readme to
clarify the situation around this CVE.

Subject: Re: [FD] CVE-2016-4484: - Cryptsetup Initrd root Shell

Hello,

It would be more precise to say "2:1.7.3-2" rather than "2:1".
This number refers to the Debian package. It seems that Debian is using
different version numbers for the "cryptsetup" package:

<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4484>

We are not sure whether the last part of the version number (2:1.7.3-2)
of the Debian package (1.7.3-2) is used to match with the cryptsetup
version.

Just to avoid confusion, the bug is on the scripts (initramfs) and not
in the cryptsetup encryption/decryption algorithms.

Regards,
Hector Marco & Ismael Ripoll.
