{
  "CVE-2016-4484": {
    "Description": "The Debian initrd script for the cryptsetup package 2:1.7.3-2 and earlier allows physically proximate attackers to gain shell access via many log in attempts with an invalid password.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of the password check within the `/scripts/local-top/cryptroot` script. The script allows a user to retry password attempts multiple times. After the maximum allowed attempts for a single LUKS password prompt are exhausted, the script does not stop the boot process but instead allows the process to continue. The `/scripts/local` script tries to mount the encrypted partition multiple times. After all these attempts to mount the partition fail, a root shell is dropped to the user via the `panic()` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper handling of password checks",
      "Failure to halt the boot sequence after multiple failed password attempts",
      "Dropping to a root shell upon multiple failures during boot sequence",
	  "Incorrectly handled error causing a shell to be launched instead of halting"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with physical console access, or remote console access in a cloud environment, can gain a root initramfs shell by repeatedly entering incorrect passwords at the LUKS password prompt during boot. This allows the attacker to copy, modify, or destroy the hard disk, as well as set up the network to exfiltrate data. The attacker could also elevate privileges by creating a setuid executable on the unencrypted boot partition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical console access (keyboard)",
      "Remote console access in cloud environments"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the console of the computer and be able to reboot it. For cloud environments, access to the console is required via the cloud provider's infrastructure. No specific technical knowledge or skills other than knowledge of pressing the [Enter] key is required."
