{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `setroubleshoot-plugins` package's `allow_execstack` plugin executes external commands using `commands.getoutput()` without sanitizing untrusted input from SELinux AVC messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Shell command injection due to insecure usage of `commands.getoutput()`."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker, by triggering a specific SELinux denial related to `execstack`, can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on systems running RHEL 7.0 or 7.1 and with privileges of setroubleshoot user on RHEL 7.2 and later.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local user can trigger an SELinux `execstack` denial using a file with a specially crafted name which is then passed as an argument to `commands.getoutput()`",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create files with controlled names and trigger specific SELinux denials related to `execstack` on the system"
