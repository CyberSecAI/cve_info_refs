{
  "CVE-2016-4953": {
    "root_cause": "The ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (ephemeral-association demobilization) by sending a spoofed crypto-NAK packet with incorrect authentication data at a certain time.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by demobilizing ephemeral associations. The service becomes unavailable due to the demobilization.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker sends a spoofed CRYPTO-NAK packet with incorrect authentication data to an NTP server."

    "additional_details": "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause denial of service via ephemeral-association demobilization. Improved packet timestamp checks are added for 4.2.8p8 to prevent the bulk of crypto-NAK forgeries."
