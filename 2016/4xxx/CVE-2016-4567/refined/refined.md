Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4567:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2016-4567 is related to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the `flashmediaelement.swf` file, which is part of the MediaElement.js library used by WordPress.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure URL Sanitization:** The `flashmediaelement.swf` file attempts to sanitize parameters passed via the URL's query string to prevent malicious code injection. However, it fails to properly handle invalid URL escape characters in parameter names. Specifically, the SWF strips invalid URL escape characters but the check for the parameter's existence is done against the unstripped name causing a bypass in the parameter sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Flash file also uses a blacklist to prevent certain characters (like parenthesis) that could be used for JavaScript code execution. However, it fails to block backticks (`) which are used in ECMAScript 6 for template literals and can be used for code execution.
*   **Chrome's Handling of Direct SWF Loading:** When a SWF file is accessed directly via the browser (instead of being embedded in a webpage via `<embed>` or `<object>`), Chrome automatically generates an `<embed>` tag with an `id` attribute. The Flash file uses the presence of this id attribute for an additional security check, which is unintentionally bypassed when Chrome creates the `id`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This is a reflected XSS vulnerability as the malicious payload is sent through the URL and immediately reflected back and executed in the client's browser.
*   **Bypassed Security Checks:** The SWF file includes flawed security checks which can be bypassed by an attacker using a combination of invalid characters, ES6 backticks and leveraging Chrome's SWF handling.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they access the malicious URL.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker can use this to steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information from the user.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website or inject code that installs malware on their machine.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker can modify the content of the page viewed by the victim.
*   **Account Takeover:** If successful, the attacker could possibly use the XSS to gain access to the user's account.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** The primary attack vector is via a specially crafted URL that directly targets the vulnerable `flashmediaelement.swf` file. This URL would contain the malicious JavaScript payload in a parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker might use social engineering to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
*   **Phishing:** An attacker can send a phishing email containing the malicious link.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Ability to Disseminate Malicious URL:** The attacker needs a means to distribute this URL to potential victims.
*   **Target using Chrome:** The vulnerability is easier to exploit on Chrome because of its SWF handling, although it would still be exploitable in other browsers under different circumstances.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects WordPress versions 4.2 through 4.5.1
*   The vulnerability is fixed in WordPress 4.5.2.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Mario Heiderich, Masato Kinugawa, and Filedescriptor from Cure53.

The provided information from the changelog of MediaElement.js confirms the fix was implemented by changing the way the flash file parsed the querystring and using a regex to match against allowed characters.
