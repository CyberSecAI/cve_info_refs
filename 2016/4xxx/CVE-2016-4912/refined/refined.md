Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4912:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `_xrealloc()` function (later renamed to `slp_xrealloc`) within the OpenSLP library. This function is used for memory reallocation.
- The core issue is a missing check for a null return value from the internal `_xmalloc` function (later `slp_xmalloc`) when reallocating memory. If `_xmalloc` fails to allocate the requested memory and returns NULL, the code proceeds to dereference the returned NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. When `_xmalloc` fails to allocate memory, it returns a NULL pointer. The code then attempts to use this NULL pointer as a valid memory location, triggering a segmentation fault (crash).
- **Unchecked `malloc` Return Value:** The root cause is the failure to check the return value of `_xmalloc` before using it. This is a classic programming error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service. By sending a large number of requests, they can potentially exhaust server memory, causing `_xmalloc` to fail and leading to a crash due to the null pointer dereference.
- **Unspecified Impacts:** Gentoo's advisory notes that there could be "other unspecified impacts" beyond just DoS, although no other impacts are specified in other sources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The attack is remotely triggerable by sending specifically crafted or a high volume of requests to the vulnerable OpenSLP service.
- **Network-Based:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via the network, targeting the service's network-facing interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable OpenSLP service.
- **Ability to Send Requests:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the service, which could be either normal SLP requests or requests designed to trigger memory allocation failures.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is present in the vulnerable code paths that do not require authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Debug builds:**  A Red Hat comment indicates the affected `_xrealloc` function is only present in debug builds of OpenSLP. This would suggest that the vulnerability is less likely to be present in production deployments, which would often use non-debug builds.
- **Portability:** The oss-security email mentions OpenSLP's portability to many operating systems, suggesting the issue may impact systems beyond just Linux.
- **Upstream Fix:** The issue was fixed in an upstream OpenSLP commit.
- **Red Hat WONTFIX Status:** Red Hat closed the bug as WONTFIX, likely due to the debug-only nature of the vulnerable code. However, they did provide updates for affected Fedora versions.
- **Gentoo fix:** Gentoo issued a security advisory which resulted in a fix for affected versions.

In summary, CVE-2016-4912 describes a vulnerability in OpenSLP where a missing check on the return value of `_xmalloc` could result in a null pointer dereference and denial-of-service. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and is triggered by sending network requests that result in memory allocation failure within OpenSLP's `_xrealloc` function.
