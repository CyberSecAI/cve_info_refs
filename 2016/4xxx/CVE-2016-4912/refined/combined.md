Subject: Re: CVE Request: null pointer deref in openslp, can be triggered remotely

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> return value from malloc isn't checked

Our guess is that this probably wasn't an intentional design choice,
and thus it's a security-related bug for some deployments. Use
CVE-2016-4912.

> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1329295>

The oss-security message and the rhbz document seem to describe the
impact in different ways, i.e., "Basically return value from malloc
isn't checked ... This can be triggered remotely by sending a large
number of requests, which could possibly lead malloc to fail at one
point, causing crash via null pointer deref" versus "A remote attacker
could potentially deplete the memory of the server." For purposes of
CVE, this type of scenario is often not interpreted as two independent
problems. Roughly speaking, it is interpreted as "The unchecked malloc
return value is the primary problem. This problem becomes reachable
for reasons that aren't fully described, but those reasons might
involve a design limitation in which the memory consumption of
requests is not strictly controlled."

<http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/UsersGuide/Security.html> says "The
OpenSLP daemon (slpd) must run as root initially in order to bind to
the well known SLP port. However, slpd will relinquish root privileges
and suid() to the daemon user (if it exists)." Thus, maybe the
affected code is running as root with large or unbounded resource
limits in some situations.

> Because of the way memory works on modern linux systems, this one seems
> to be difficult to exploit

Maybe there is a relevant non-Linux case?
<http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/faq.html> says "the OpenSLP code has
proven to be very portable. It currently works on many operating
systems including: Linux, BSD, Solaris, Tru64, HPUX, UnixWare, OSR5,
and Win32."

Finally, although perhaps not related to the issue of whether a CVE ID
should exist, that Security.html page says "If you find a security
hole in OpenSLP, please bring it to the attention of the OpenSLP
maintainer" and names John Calcote. Possibly Red Hat could do this
upstream notification if that hasn't already happened.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1329295#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-04-21 14:40:35 UTC  ``` A null pointer dereference vulnerability was found in function _xrealloc() in xlsp_xmalloc.c in OpenSLP. A remote attacker could potentially crash the server when large number of packets are sent.  Vulnerable code:  void * _xrealloc(const char * file, int line, void * ptr, size_t size) { xallocation_t * x;  if (!ptr) return _xmalloc(file, line, size);  if (!size) { _xfree(file, line, ptr); return 0; }  x = _xmalloc_find(ptr); if (x != 0) { void * newptr = ptr; if (x->size != size) { newptr = _xmalloc(file, line, size);   //*** return 0 if failed from _xmalloc memcpy(newptr, ptr, x->size);  //*** it'll cased a null pointer reference _xfree(file, line, x); } return newptr; }  if (G_xmalloc_fh) fprintf(G_xmalloc_fh, "*** xrealloc called on " "non-xmalloc'd memory ***\n");  return 0; }   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1329295#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-04-21 14:40:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Yuguang Cai (Qihoo 360)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1329295#c3)  Huzaifa S.

That is, it is only implemented in DEBUG builds of OpenSLP. Given this fact, it's unlikely to be a security issue in any deployment.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1329295#c11)  John Calcote    2017-04-07 18:17:26 UTC  ``` Sorry - I meant _xrealloc (now slp_xrealloc).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1329295#c12)  John Calcote    2017-04-07 18:26:25 UTC  ``` I've fixed the issue in openslp mercurial commit 1781.   ``` |  |
