Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant` handle the configuration file updates for the WPA/WPA2 passphrase parameter when this parameter contains control characters, specifically newline characters. This can be introduced through a WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper input validation: The software fails to properly sanitize or reject control characters, particularly newlines, when processing passphrase updates received via WPS.
- Configuration file manipulation:  By embedding newlines in the passphrase, an attacker can potentially manipulate the configuration file, leading to denial-of-service.
- Lack of proper sanitization in the SET_CRED and SET commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service: An attacker can cause `hostapd` or `wpa_supplicant` to fail to start, as the manipulated configuration file prevents the software from functioning correctly.
- (Specifically for CVE-2016-4477): Local privilege escalation: In `wpa_supplicant`, the ability to insert newlines allows an attacker to modify other parts of the config file, which could lead to loading local libraries and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of `wpa_supplicant`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup): An attacker within radio range or with access to the IP network can act as a WPS External Registrar and inject a passphrase with control characters via a WPS operation. This requires local user action to authorize the WPS operation.
- Control Interface: Similar issue can be triggered by using the SET_CRED or SET commands, or via the SET_NETWORK if the connection manager does not filter control characters from the psk value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **WPS Vector:**
    - The attacker must be within radio range of the device or have access to the IP network to act as a WPS External Registrar.
    - Local user interaction is required to authorize the WPS operation.
- **Control Interface Vectors:**
    - For the control interface based attack, access to the control interface is needed.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant` versions 0.6.7 up to 2.5 when compiled with `CONFIG_WPS` enabled. For wpa_supplicant the option `update_config=1` needs to be enabled in the config file.
- Patches have been released to address this vulnerability by rejecting credentials with invalid passphrases and sanitizing the configuration file output.
