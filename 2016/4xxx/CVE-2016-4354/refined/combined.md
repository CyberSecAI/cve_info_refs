# libksba: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201604-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libksba, allowing a
possible Denial of Service and unspecified other vectors through integer
overflows.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libksba** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.3** |

### Background

Libksba is a X.509 and CMS (PKCS#7) library.

### Description

libksba is vulnerable to two integer overflows and a Denial of Service
vulnerability. Please read the references for additional details.

### Impact

Remote attackers could cause Denial of Service or unspecified other
vectors through various integer overflows.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libksba users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libksba-1.3.3"

```

## Details

Hanno Böck discovered that Libksba incorrectly handled decoding certain BER

data. An attacker could use this issue to cause Libksba to crash, resulting

in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-4353](/security/CVE-2016-4353))

Hanno Böck discovered that Libksba incorrectly handled decoding certain BER

data. An attacker could use this issue to cause Libksba to crash, resulting

in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-4354](/security/CVE-2016-4354),

[CVE-2016-4355](/security/CVE-2016-4355))

Hanno Böck discovered that Libksba incorrectly handled incorrect utf-8

strings when decoding certain DN data. An attacker could use this issue to

cause Libksba to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-4356](/security/CVE-2016-4356))

Pascal Cuoq discovered that Libksba incorrectly handled incorrect utf-8

strings when decoding certain DN data. An attacker could use this issue to

cause Libksba to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-4574](/security/CVE-2016-4574))

Subject: CVE request: three issues in libksba

Hi,

Can CVEs please be assigned to these three issues (unless they've
already been assigned and I failed to find them):

Denial of Service due to stack overflow in src/ber-decoder.c
<http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=07116a314f4dcd4d96990bbd74db95a03a9f650a>

Integer overflow in the DN decoder src/dn.c

A Gentoo advisory lists them as being fixed in version 1.3.3 and higher:

Use CVE-2016-4353. (This CVE is about changing the type of error
handling after a decoder stack overflow. It is not about changing the
decoder so that a decoder stack overflow occurs in fewer cases.)

> Integer overflow in the BER decoder src/ber-decoder.c
> <http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=aea7b6032865740478ca4b706850a5217f1c3887>

We consider this two separate issues.

Use CVE-2016-4354 for the use of an incorrect integer data type.

Use CVE-2016-4355 for the cases in which the code was simply making no
attempt to check for an integer overflow (the "+ 100" cases and the
"+= d->val.length" case).

> Integer overflow in the DN decoder src/dn.c
> <http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3>

This might be an error in the original
<https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201604-04> advisory. We did not notice
any obvious relationship between
243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3 and an integer overflow fix.
The 243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3 commit message seems to
focus on "read access out of bounds." Also, there is no other recent
commit at
<http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=history;f=src/dn.c>
that refers to an integer overflow. Possibly there was an inapplicable
copy-and-paste of "Integer overflow in the" from the previous report
about the BER decoder.

Use CVE-2016-4356 for the 243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3
issue that is described as "Fix encoding of invalid utf-8 strings in
dn.c" and "read access out of bounds."
