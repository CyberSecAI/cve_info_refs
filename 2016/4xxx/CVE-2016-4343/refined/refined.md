  "CVE-2016-4343": {
    "Description": "The bcpowmod function in ext/bcmath/bcmath.c in PHP before 5.5.35, 5.6.x before 5.6.21, and 7.x before 7.0.6 accepts a negative integer for the scale argument, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted call.",
    "Root cause": "The `bcpowmod` function in PHP's `bcmath` extension does not properly validate the scale argument, allowing a negative integer which leads to memory corruption.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Uninitialized pointer"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service or possibly other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a call to the `bcpowmod` function with a negative scale argument."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute code that calls the `bcpowmod` function within PHP.",
    "Additional Details": {
      "SUSE": "The SUSE content provides additional context indicating that the vulnerability involves modifying data structures (copies of _zero_, _one_, or _two_ global variables) without considering if they're copies or originals. They also rated the vulnerability as 'low' severity (2.1) according to CVSS v2, while NVD rated it as 'high' (9.8) using CVSS v3, based on a network attack vector.  The SUSE content includes a list of affected products and their respective fixed package versions, as well as related SUSE Bugzilla entries and security advisories.",
      "RedHat": "The Red Hat content indicates that the vulnerability is present in `rh-php56` and its components.  They mention that a negative scale integer allows a heap buffer overflow, and this can corrupt the `_one_` definition.  The provided RHSA advisory also lists several other CVEs that were addressed in the same update, including a use-after-free, out-of-bounds reads, buffer over-writes and integer overflow vulnerabilities in PHP, and multiple flaws in the PCRE library. The Red Hat content also contains a list of affected products, fixed package versions and the references to the resolved CVEs and Bugzilla entries."
