Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-4989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `setroubleshoot` and `setroubleshoot-plugins` packages contained flaws in how they executed external commands. Specifically, they did not properly sanitize untrusted input originating from SELinux AVC messages when used as arguments to shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Shell Command Injection:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `subprocess.check_output`, `commands.getstatusoutput`, and `commands.getoutput` with unsanitized inputs. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the shell command.
    *   Specifically, the `_set_tpath()` function in `audit_data.py` used the `locate` command with a path taken from AVC denial messages, creating a command susceptible to injection via a specially crafted path.
    *   The `run_fix()` function in `SetroubleshootFixit.py` was also vulnerable, as it was using string formatting to create a command which was then executed via `commands.getoutput`.
*   On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 and 7.1, setroubleshoot was run with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker could exploit these command injection flaws to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `setroubleshoot` user.
    *   On older systems (RHEL 6, and RHEL 7.0 and 7.1), where setroubleshoot ran with root privileges, the attacker could gain full root access.
    *   On RHEL 7.2 and later, while `setroubleshootd` is running as dedicated non-root user `setroubleshoot`,  the `SetroubleshootFixit` DBus service was running with root privileges.
*   **Container Breakout:** An attacker inside a container could exploit the vulnerability to achieve execution in the `setroubleshoot` domain with uid 0 on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **SELinux Denial Trigger:** The attacker needs to trigger specific SELinux denials that cause setroubleshoot to process the malicious AVC message.
*   **Crafted Input:**  A crafted path or other input from an AVC message is required to perform code injection when processed by `setroubleshoot`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger SELinux denials and supply crafted input.
*   For versions prior to RHEL 7.2, root access is possible due to setroubleshoot running as root.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in setroubleshoot and setroubleshoot-plugins packages.
*   The issue was also reported by Sebastian Krahmer (SuSE Security Team) independently.
*   Patches were released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHSA-2016:1267) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHSA-2016:1293).
*   Upstream commits addressing the vulnerability can be found on Github in the `setroubleshoot` project.
