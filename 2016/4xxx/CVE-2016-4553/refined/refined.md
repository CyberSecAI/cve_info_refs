  "CVE-2016-4553": {
    "description": "Squid before 3.5.18 and 4.x before 4.0.10 does not properly ignore the Host header when an absolute-URI is provided, which allows remote attackers to conduct cache-poisoning attacks via an HTTP request.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect data validation of intercepted HTTP Request messages.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Squid does not properly ignore the Host header when absolute-URI is provided.",
          "Incorrect handling of intercepted HTTP Request messages allows bypassing protection against CVE-2009-0801 related issues."
      ],
       "impact": "Cache poisoning. Any client can bypass local security and poison the proxy cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary source.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker can send HTTP requests that pass through a shared transparent cache.",
         "additional_info": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request with an absolute URI while also setting a Host header. Squid incorrectly uses the Host header for verification while using the URI host for caching."
