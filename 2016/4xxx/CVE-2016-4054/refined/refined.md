  "CVE-2016-4054": {
    "description": "Buffer overflow and input validation flaws were found in the way Squid processed ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy, or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a remote attacker able to control ESI components on an HTTP server could use these flaws to crash Squid, disclose parts of the stack memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Squid.",

      "root_cause": "Buffer overflow and input validation flaws in Squid's ESI response processing.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution, denial of service, and/or disclosure of parts of stack memory.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker controls ESI components on an HTTP server and interacts with a vulnerable Squid instance through reverse proxying or TLS/HTTPS interception.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker needs to control ESI components on an HTTP server.",
     "affected_configurations": "Squid instance must be configured as reverse proxy or used for TLS/HTTPS interception; enabled ESI"
