We already assigned CVE-2016-4456 for using insecure getenv() on
GNUTLS_KEYLOGFILE when we got a report for this issue. Not sure why it's
not included in the advisory. I'm dealing with that now.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1343505#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-07 12:00:20 UTC  ``` It was reported that gnutls 3.4.12 uses an environment variable (GNUTLS_KEYLOGFILE) to write the keys of the running sessions. This variable is obtained insecurely via getenv(), meaning that any set-uid program using gnutls can be used to overwrite any file on the filesystem.  Upstream patch:  <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/compare/fb2a6baef79f4aadfd95e657fe5a18da20a1410e...86076c9b17b9a32b348cafb8b724f57f7da64d58>  External References:  <http://gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2016-1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1343505#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-07 12:00:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1343505#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-07 12:01:01 UTC  ```  Created gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-23 [[bug 1343508](show_bug.cgi?id=1343508 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-4456 gnutls: various flaws [fedora-23]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1343505#c3)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-07 12:01:38 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1343342](show_bug.cgi?id=1343342 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - gnutls: file overwrite by setuid programs (GNUTLS-SA-2016-1)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1343505#c4)  Fedora Update System    2016-06-08 22:52:31 UTC  ``` gnutls-3.4.13-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

This issue was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.12 with the GNUTLS_KEYLOGFILE environment variable handling via getenv() and fixed in GnuTLS 3.4.13 by switching to secure_getenv() where available. Recommendation: Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.13, or later versions.
