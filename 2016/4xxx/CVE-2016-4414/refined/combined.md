Subject: CVE request - Quassel IRC denial of service

Hi,

It was found that quasselcore is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack by unauthenticated clients. The protocol negotiation did not
take into account lack of a match, in which case
PeerFactory::createPeer returns a nullptr, which is immediately
dereferenced [1].
This issue was introduced in commit d1bf207 [2] (version 0.10.0 and
later), and fixed in commit e678873 [3] (tagged as version 0.12.4).

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue?

[2] <https://github.com/quassel/quassel/commit/d1bf207>
[3] <https://github.com/quassel/quassel/commit/e678873>

Handle invalid handshake data properly in the core

```
Clients sending invalid handshake data could make the core crash
due to an unchecked pointer. This commit fixes this issue by having
the core close the socket if a peer could not be created.

Thanks to Bas Pape (Tucos) for finding this one!

Handle invalid handshake data properly in the core

```
Clients sending invalid handshake data could make the core crash
due to an unchecked pointer. This commit fixes this issue by having
the core close the socket if a peer could not be created.

Thanks to Bas Pape (Tucos) for finding this one!

Most notably, Tucos (thanks a lot!) has figured out that invalid handshake data may cause the core to crash. Another annoying issue was the lack of support for the STATUSMSG feature available in some IRC networks. This one was recently abused by idio^Wpeople to pop up tons of spam queries for some of our users.  Both issues are fixed in [version 0.12.4](/pub/quassel-0.12.4.tar.bz2). We highly recommend people to upgrade their cores, and distros to backport the related patches to older versions they still maintain. As a bonus, translations have been updated for this release, and support for non-compliant IRC networks has been improved. You can find the usual artifacts on our [downloads page](/downloads).  Here's hoping that my next blog finally talks about new features instead of new bugs!  All the best, ~ Sput on behalf of the Quassel Team  »  * [Sputnick's blog](/blog/1 "Read Sputnick's latest blog entries.") |
