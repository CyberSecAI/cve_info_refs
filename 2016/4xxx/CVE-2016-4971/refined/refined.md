  "CVE-2016-4971": {
    "description": "GNU wget before 1.18 allows remote servers to write to arbitrary files by redirecting a request from HTTP to a crafted FTP resource.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient checks in GNU Wget when handling HTTP redirects to FTP resources. Specifically, wget uses the filename provided in the FTP redirect URL, rather than the original HTTP request, to save the file, potentially allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path and name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of filename sanitization and validation",
      "Improper handling of redirects",
      "Trust of server-supplied filenames during redirects"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can write arbitrary files on the system running wget. This can lead to:\n- Arbitrary code execution by creating executable files, scripts, or configuration files in sensitive locations.\n- Modification of user settings by overwriting .bash_profile, .wgetrc files\n- Data exfiltration by writing sensitive data to attacker-controlled locations.\n- Configuration manipulation and proxy redirection by writing to .wgetrc files, allowing future wget requests to be routed through attacker-controlled servers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTTP response with redirect to a malicious FTP resource",
      "Man-in-the-middle attack to modify HTTP responses with malicious redirects"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs a way to serve a crafted HTTP response when a victim uses wget.\n\nAttacker controlled HTTP server to send malicious 30x redirects.\n\nAttacker needs to control a FTP server to host malicious files.\n\nMay require the ability to intercept network traffic or have some access to the target system (e.g. via compromised application or website)."
