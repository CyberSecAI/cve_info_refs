Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient permission checks in NetCommons.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with "CLERK" (secretariat) privileges can create a new user with "SYSTEM_ADMIN" (administrator) privileges. This is a direct privilege escalation.
- **CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls:**  The vulnerability falls under this category, highlighting the inadequate access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Impact: High:** An attacker gaining administrator privileges can access sensitive information.
- **Integrity Impact: Low:** While not as high as confidentiality, there is some risk of unauthorized modification of data and system configuration.
- **Availability Impact: None:** The described vulnerability does not directly lead to a denial of service.
- A successful exploit allows a low-privileged user to gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges Required:** An attacker needs an account with "CLERK" privileges in NetCommons.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any actions from other users to be successful.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The exploit is likely straightforward to execute once the vulnerability is understood.
