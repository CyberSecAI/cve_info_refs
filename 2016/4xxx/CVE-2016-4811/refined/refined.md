Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper security measures in the "Japan Connected-free Wi-Fi" application, which allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to execute arbitrary APIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application is vulnerable to arbitrary API execution.
- Lack of proper validation or security measures that can prevent execution of arbitrary API commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Android:** An attacker can execute arbitrary APIs if the app has the necessary permissions granted in the Android manifest.
- **iOS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary APIs without any permission checks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the server using a malicious wireless LAN access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MitM attack, typically by controlling or operating a malicious Wi-Fi access point.
- No special privileges on the target device itself are required. The attacker exploits the vulnerability through network manipulation.
