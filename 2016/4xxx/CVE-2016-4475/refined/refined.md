{
  "CVE-2016-4475": {
    "Description": "A number of API and UI actions/URLs for viewing and managing organizations and locations are not limited to the orgs/locations assigned directly to the user, instead they are only restricted by permissions assigned to the user's roles.",
    "Root cause": "The API and UI did not properly restrict access to organization and location resources based on user associations, relying only on role-based permissions. Specifically, the API index calls (GET /api/v2/organizations, GET /api/v2/locations), API show/update/destroy calls, and UI edit/update/destroy calls were affected.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Users could view, edit, and delete organizations and locations they were not associated with, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of system configurations.",
    "Attack vector": "Network access via API or UI.",
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker would need to have a valid user account on the vulnerable system, with permissions to manage orgs/locations.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is present in Red Hat Satellite and Foreman. The fix includes overriding methods for resource scopes to limit access based on user associations with organizations and locations. A similar vulnerability was found in API and UI actions for Foreman, which was also addressed by applying fixes in Foreman version 1.12.0-RC3 and 1.11.4"
