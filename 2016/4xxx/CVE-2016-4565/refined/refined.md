```
Root cause of vulnerability: The InfiniBand (IB) stack in the Linux kernel incorrectly relied on the write system call.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The use of `write()` as a replacement for bi-directional `ioctl()` is unsafe. This allows for the return structure, which is normally written to user space, to instead be directed to user-specified kernel memory.
Impact of exploitation: Local users can cause a denial of service (kernel memory write operation) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
Attack vectors: Exploitation occurs via a uAPI interface.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Local user access is required. The uAPI interfaces are available if hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.

```
Root cause of vulnerability: A flaw in the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem used `write()` as a bi-directional `ioctl()` replacement. This resulted in insufficient memory security checks when invoked using the `splice()` system call.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unprivileged users could use the vulnerability to overwrite kernel memory
Impact of exploitation: Local unprivileged users on a system with either InfiniBand hardware or the `rdma_ucm` module could escalate their privileges.
Attack vectors: Vulnerable to exploitation by calling `write()` via the `splice()` system call.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Local unprivileged users with Infiniband hardware or the `rdma_ucm` module loaded.
