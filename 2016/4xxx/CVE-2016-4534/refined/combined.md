Security Advisory       @ Mediaservice.net Srl
(#01, 13/04/2016)        Data Security Division

         Title:  McAfee VirusScan Enterprise security restrictions bypass
   Application:  McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.8 and prior versions
      Platform:  Microsoft Windows
   Description:  A local Windows administrator is able to bypass the
    security restrictions and disable the antivirus engine
    without knowing the correct management password
        Author:  Maurizio Agazzini <inode@mediaservice.net>
 Vendor Status: Fixed
    References: http://lab.mediaservice.net/advisory/2016-01-mcafee.txt
                http://lab.mediaservice.net/code/mcafee_unprotector.c

1. Abstract.

McAfee VirusScan Enterprise has a feature to protect the scan engine
from local Windows administrators. A management password is needed to
disable it, unless Windows is running in "Safe Mode".

>From our understanding this feature is implemented insecurely: the
McAfee VirusScan Console checks the password and requests the engine to
unlock the safe registry keys. No checks are done by the engine itself,
so anyone can directly request the engine to stop without knowing the
correct management password.

2. Example Attack Session.

The attack can be reproduced in different ways, here are some examples.

Example 1:

Open the McAfee VirusScan Console and Sysinternals Process Explorer.

Under Process Explorer:

- Locate the mcconsol.exe process
- Type CTRL+L (show lower pane)
- Search for all "HKLM\SOFTWARE\McAfee\DesktopProtection" keys
- Close all the handles of this registry key

Go back to the McAfee Console and:

- Go to: Tools -> General Options
- Select the "Password Options" tab
- Select "No password" and apply settings

Now it is possible to stop the antivirus engine.

Example 2:

A specific tool has been written to request to disable password
protection. After running the tool you can disable it via the VirusScan
Console.

Code: http://lab.mediaservice.net/code/mcafee_unprotector.c

3. Affected Platforms.

All McAfee Viruscan Enterprise versions prior to 8.8 without SB10151 are
affected. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that an attacker
has local Windows administrator privileges.

4. Fix.

On 25 February 2016, version SB10151 hotfix has been relased by McAfee,
which fixes the described vulnerability.

https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10151

5. Proof Of Concept.

See Example Attack Session above.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# McAfee VirusScan Enterprise security restrictions bypass

Security Advisory                       @ Mediaservice.net Srl
(#01, 13/04/2016)                       Data Security Division

         Title: McAfee VirusScan Enterprise security restrictions bypass
   Application: McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.8 and prior versions
      Platform: Microsoft Windows
   Description: A local Windows administrator is able to bypass the
                security restrictions and disable the antivirus engine
                without knowing the correct management password
        Author: Maurizio Agazzini <inode () mediaservice net>
 Vendor Status: Fixed
    References: <http://lab.mediaservice.net/advisory/2016-01-mcafee.txt>
                <http://lab.mediaservice.net/code/mcafee_unprotector.c>

1. Abstract.

McAfee VirusScan Enterprise has a feature to protect the scan engine
from local Windows administrators. A management password is needed to
disable it, unless Windows is running in "Safe Mode".

```
> ```
> From our understanding this feature is implemented insecurely: the
>
> ```

```
McAfee VirusScan Console checks the password and requests the engine to
unlock the safe registry keys. No checks are done by the engine itself,
so anyone can directly request the engine to stop without knowing the
correct management password.

2. Example Attack Session.

The attack can be reproduced in different ways, here are some examples.

Example 1:

Open the McAfee VirusScan Console and Sysinternals Process Explorer.

Under Process Explorer:

- Locate the mcconsol.exe process
- Type CTRL+L (show lower pane)
- Search for all "HKLM\SOFTWARE\McAfee\DesktopProtection" keys
- Close all the handles of this registry key

Go back to the McAfee Console and:

- Go to: Tools -> General Options
- Select the "Password Options" tab
- Select "No password" and apply settings

Now it is possible to stop the antivirus engine.

Example 2:

A specific tool has been written to request to disable password
protection. After running the tool you can disable it via the VirusScan
Console.

Code: <http://lab.mediaservice.net/code/mcafee_unprotector.c>

3. Affected Platforms.

All McAfee Viruscan Enterprise versions prior to 8.8 without SB10151 are
affected. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that an attacker
has local Windows administrator privileges.

4. Fix.

On 25 February 2016, version SB10151 hotfix has been relased by McAfee,
which fixes the described vulnerability.

<https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10151>

5. Proof Of Concept.

See Example Attack Session above.
