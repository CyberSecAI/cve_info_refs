  "CVE-2016-4534": {
    "Description": "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise has a feature to protect the scan engine from local Windows administrators. A management password is required to disable it, unless Windows is running in \"Safe Mode\". The vulnerability arises because the McAfee VirusScan Console checks the password and requests the engine to unlock the safe registry keys, but the engine itself does not perform any checks. This allows anyone to directly request the engine to stop without knowing the correct management password.",
    "Root cause": "Insecure implementation of password protection for the scan engine. The McAfee VirusScan engine does not validate requests to disable password protection, relying solely on the console application for authentication.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper authorization checks within the McAfee VirusScan engine itself.",
      "Trusting the console application for enforcement of security restrictions.",
	  "Missing checks on device io control codes"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local Windows administrator can bypass security restrictions and disable the antivirus engine without knowing the correct management password.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Directly sending a crafted device io control request to the McAfee scan engine's driver.",
      "Manipulating registry keys via tools like Process Explorer to bypass the password prompt in the console."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local Windows administrator privileges."
  }
