{
  "CVE-2016-4459": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the mod_manager module of mod_cluster in JBoss. When processing a request with a JVMRoute longer than 80 characters via strcpy, the strcpy operation overflows the buffer. This can lead to a segmentation fault causing the server to crash.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `mod_manager` module in `mod_cluster` uses `strcpy` to copy the JVMRoute, which is attacker-controlled, into a buffer of 80 bytes without proper bounds checking. If the provided JVMRoute exceeds 80 characters, a buffer overflow occurs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Unsafe string copy using strcpy"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploitation can lead to a segmentation fault and a server crash. This would impact availability of the service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious HTTP request",
        "MCMP Service Message with oversized JVMRoute"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a request with a JVMRoute that is longer than 80 characters to trigger the vulnerability. The affected VirtualHost must be exposed to the attacker."

     "affected_products":[
        "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6",
