| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c0)  Timothy Walsh    2016-06-01 10:18:03 UTC  ``` Configuration of mod_cluster via JVMRoute longer than 80 characters will cause segfault.  A segmentation fault can occur in Apache HTTPD 2.2.   The crash is due to a strcpy buffer overflow in mod_cluster's mod_manager.  <https://github.com/modcluster/mod_cluster/blob/1.2.9.Final/native/mod_manager/node.c#L227> [Open URL]  If clients send a request with a JVMRoute longer than 80 characters (the size of the strcpy destination), the strcpy segfaults.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c6)  Timothy Walsh    2016-06-02 03:49:36 UTC  ```   Acknowledgments:  Name: Robert Bost (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-10-12 17:02:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.10  Via RHSA-2016:2056 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2056.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-10-12 17:09:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:2054 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2054.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-10-12 17:20:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2016:2055 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2055.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-15 22:20:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2016:2957 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-25 20:05:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:0194 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0194](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0194)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1341583#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-25 20:07:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:0193 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0193](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0193)   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0194)

## Topic

An update is now available for JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release adds the new Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 packages that are part of the JBoss Core Services offering.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.6 and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for creating a virtual host mapping rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow. (CVE-2016-6808)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)
* An error was found in protocol parsing logic of mod\_cluster load balancer Apache HTTP Server modules. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process. (CVE-2016-8612)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Bock, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2055)

## Topic

Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.10 natives, fix several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

This release includes bug fixes and enhancements, as well as a new release of OpenSSL. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)
* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)

Red Hat would like to thank Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

## Issue

* How to install JBoss Native components in EAP 6 installed on RHEL6
* How to install and configure Apache Portability Runtime (`APR`) in EAP6?
* What is the standard and supported way to enable Apache Portable Runtime (`APR`) native connector protocol in EAP6?
* Cannot download Native components for EAP 6.
* I'm looking for installing native libs (at least Tomcat's) on my JBoss install. The following error is seen :

```
2015-07-11 18:55:30,149 INFO  [org.apache.catalina.core] (MSC service thread 1-95) : JBWEB001065: The native library which allows optimal performance in production environments was not found on the java.library.path: /usr/java/packages/lib/amd64:/usr/lib64:/lib64:/lib:/usr/lib

```

What files are needed for JBoss to load ?

## Environment

* Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)
  + 6.x
* EAP installed with zip or installer (not RPMs)

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0193)

## Topic

Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.23 and fix several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release adds the new Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 packages that are part of the JBoss Core Services offering.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.6, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for creating a virtual host mapping rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow. (CVE-2016-6808)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)
* An error was found in protocol parsing logic of mod\_cluster load balancer Apache HTTP Server modules. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process. (CVE-2016-8612)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Bock, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes
described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library
must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Pointer arithmetic undefined behaviour ([CVE-2016-2177](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2177)) ======================================================  Severity: Low  Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic  A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: "p + len > limit"  Where "p" points to some malloc'd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE  "len" here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message).  The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that "p + len" is only well defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour.  For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for "p" such that "p + len" actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len < limit.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c0)  Timothy Walsh    2016-04-12 12:11:43 UTC  ``` It is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod_cluster via service messages (MCMP).  Only the VirtualHost explicitly enabled by an administrator to receive service messages from worker nodes (Tomcat or EAP workers).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1331402#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 13:14:05 UTC  ``` Quoting form the draft of OpenSSL upstream advisory:  Memory corruption in the ASN.1 encoder ([CVE-2016-2108](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2108)) ======================================================  Severity: High  This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of the bug was not known at the time.  In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in i2c_ASN1_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create "negative zeroes" when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug.  However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i_ASN1_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY structures.  Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations.  Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSL's default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2c OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1o  This vulnerability is a combination of two bugs, neither of which individually has security impact. The first bug (mishandling of negative zero integers) was reported to OpenSSL by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat) and independently by Hanno Böck in April 2015. The second issue (mishandling of large universal tags) was found using libFuzzer, and reported on the public issue tracker on March 1st 2016. The fact that these two issues combined present a security vulnerability was reported by David Benjamin (Google) on March 31st 2016. The fixes were developed by Steve Henson of the OpenSSL development team, and David Benjamin.  The OpenSSL team would also like to thank Mark Brand and Ian Beer from the Google Project Zero team for their careful analysis of the impact.  The fix for the "negative zero" memory corruption bug can be identified by commits  3661bb4e7934668bd99ca777ea8b30eedfafa871 (1.0.2) and 32d3b0f52f77ce86d53f38685336668d47c5bdfe (1.0.1)  End of quote.

# RHSA-2016:2054 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.10 natives update on RHEL 7

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2054)

## Topic

Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.10 natives, fix several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

This release includes bug fixes and enhancements, as well as a new release of OpenSSL. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)
* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)

Red Hat would like to thank Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
