Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `plupload.flash.swf` file used by WordPress for file uploads. The SWF file attempts to remove `flashVars` set as GET parameters but fails to do so correctly. Specifically, a "GET Killer" mechanism designed to remove parameters from the URL was bypassed via the vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Same-Origin Method Execution (SOME):** The core weakness is the insecure handling of URL parameters within the SWF file. The `ExternalInterface.call` function within the SWF can be manipulated to call arbitrary methods on the DOM within the same origin by setting the `target` parameter.
*   **Insecure URL Sanitization:** The URL sanitization within `plupload.flash.swf` is not strict enough. Although it removes non-word characters from the `uid` parameter and only allows word characters and dots in the `target` parameter, it's still vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Bypassing "GET Killer":** The attempt to remove GET parameters before using `ExternalInterface.call` was flawed. The method used to parse URL parameters could be bypassed by exploiting how the parameters were split and trimmed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could potentially achieve RCE by crafting a malicious payload that uses the SOME vulnerability to trigger actions on the vulnerable WordPress site, such as installing a plugin.
*   **Arbitrary DOM Manipulation:** The attacker can control the callback function of the SWF file and traverse the DOM to click buttons, trigger actions, etc., within the same origin using `opener.document.body...` style parameters.
*   **Plugin Installation:** The provided example shows how an attacker can navigate to a plugin installation page and trigger the installation of a malicious plugin, ultimately leading to RCE on the server.
*   **Clickjacking/Reverse Clickjacking:** The SOME attack can be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim without their knowledge, by forcing clicks on elements they are not aware of.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker creates a malicious URL containing crafted `target` and `uid` parameters that, when loaded in the victim's browser, exploits the vulnerability in the SWF file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious URL, often through a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of DOM structure:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the target website's DOM structure in order to craft the `target` parameter correctly to trigger specific actions.
*   **Ability to induce user interaction:**  The attacker needs to make a logged-in user visit the malicious URL, often through social engineering.
*   **No direct network access is necessary:** The attack can be performed with the victim simply visiting a malicious URL in their browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in WordPress versions 4.5.1 and earlier and was fixed in version 4.5.2.
*   The issue was discovered by the Cure53 team and reported through HackerOne.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can trigger an arbitrary click, and how the SOME vulnerability can be chained to achieve RCE via plugin installation.
*   Browser-based XSS filters do not detect this type of attack.

In summary, this is a critical vulnerability due to the ease of exploitation and the potential for Remote Code Execution through a cleverly crafted URL.
