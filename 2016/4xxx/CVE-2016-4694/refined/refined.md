Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-4694:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the HTTP_PROXY environment variable was handled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The HTTP_PROXY environment variable was being set from CGI, which allowed for potential manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could potentially proxy traffic through an arbitrary server. This could lead to the attacker intercepting or redirecting communications meant for the legitimate server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the handling of the HTTP_PROXY environment variable in the context of CGI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the HTTP_PROXY environment variable in a CGI context, which typically implies they can send a request that interacts with a vulnerable application/script.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is addressed by not setting the HTTP_PROXY environment variable from CGI.
- This vulnerability affects macOS Server 5.2, and OS X Lion v10.7.5 and later.
