Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in Cybozu Office. This is indicated by the CWE mapping to "Improper Input Validation" (CWE-20).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the insufficient input validation within the Cybozu Office application, making it susceptible to denial-of-service attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This means the application becomes unavailable to legitimate users as the attack consumes system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Privileges Required:** The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability according to CVSS v3. In CVSS v2, Single instance of authentication (Au:S) is needed.
-   **User Interaction:** No user interaction is needed (UI:N). The attack can be carried out without any required action from a user.
-   **Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**
Cybozu Office versions 9.0.0 to 10.4.0 are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to improper input validation. An attacker with network access and low privileges can exploit this by sending crafted requests to consume system resources, rendering the application unavailable.
