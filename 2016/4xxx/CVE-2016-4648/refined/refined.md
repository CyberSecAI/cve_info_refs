Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `DspFuncLib` extension within Apple OS X. Specifically, the issue stems from the failure to properly handle error conditions. This improper handling leads to a dangling pointer, which is a pointer that points to memory that has already been freed. Subsequent reuse of this freed memory can lead to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when memory that has been freed is accessed again.
- **Dangling Pointer:** A dangling pointer is created because of improper error handling, which leads to the use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can escalate privileges to execute code under the context of root, effectively gaining full control of the system.
- **Disclosure of Kernel Memory Layout:** The Apple advisory mentions that this vulnerability can also allow a local user to determine kernel memory layout, which can be used to further exploit the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the target system.
- **Malicious File:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious file that exploits the weakness within the `DspFuncLib` extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires a user to open a malicious file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apple OS X.
- Apple has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple by Jack Tang and Moony Li of Trend Micro, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative. The Apple security update also credits Juwei Lin(@fuzzerDOTcn) of Trend Micro for reporting the vulnerability, however, the ZDI advisory indicates that this researcher was involved in reporting a different, but related, audio vulnerability (CVE-2016-4647).
- The CVSS score is 6.9, with a vector of AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, indicating a local attack with medium complexity, no authentication, and complete confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
