- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the Smart DNS function due to a lack of parameter verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the Smart DNS function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Denial of Service (DoS)
  - Potential execution of arbitrary code
- **Attack vectors**: A malformed packet with illegitimate parameters in the Smart DNS function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have access to the device network.
    - The Smart DNS function must be active.
