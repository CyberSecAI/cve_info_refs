      "description": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Roundcube Webmail before 1.1.5 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for requests that download attachments and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) via unspecified vectors.",
      "vulnerability_details": [
        {
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of CSRF protection on attachment download URLs.",
