Subject: Re: CVE Request: Roundcube: XSS issue in SVG image handling and protection for download urs against CSRF

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Changelog>
> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases>

> Fix XSS issue in SVG images handling (#4949):
> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/4949>
> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/40d7342dd9c9bd2a1d613edc848ed95a4d71aa18>
> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/7bbefdb63b12e2344cf1cb87aeb6e3933b4063e0>

Use CVE-2015-8864 for the issue that was fixed by these commits. Use
CVE-2016-4068 for the remaining SVG XSS issues that were not fixed
(i.e., the SVG XSS issues that remain present in versions 1.0.9,
1.1.5, and 1.2-rc), as described in the
<https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/40d7342dd9c9bd2a1d613edc848ed95a4d71aa18#commitcomment-15294218>
comment:

   thomascube commented on 40d7342 Jan 6, 2016

   Good start! Removing script nodes, however, is just the beginning.
   XSS code can also be in node attributes like onclick, onmouseover,
   href="javascript:, etc. or even in CSS url() as we learned with
   HTML messages.

   So traversing the entire DOM is probably necessary to provide
   protection that goes beyond the one example we received.

> Protect download urls against CSRF using unique request tokens (#4957):
> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/4957>
> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/4a408843b0ef816daf70a472a02b78cd6073a4d5>
> <https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/699af1e5206ed9114322adaa3c25c1c969640a53>

Use CVE-2016-4069. This is not a typical type of impact associated
with CSRF; however, it is still probably best to categorize this as a
CSRF issue, not an SSRF issue.

[![@rcubetrac](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17438468?u=5b98ad5b5c260bccd9885d58020feb38a8d7efc1&v=4&size=48)](/rcubetrac)[rcubetrac](https://github.com/rcubetrac)opened [on Jan 16, 2016](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/4957#issue-142212657)

*Reported by [@thomascube](https://github.com/thomascube) on 16 Jan 2016 16:36 UTC as Trac ticket #1490642*

Message attachments are downloaded via GET requests (with `_download=1`) and therefore can be triggered by a 3rd party site with guessed URLs and an active session in the victims browser. While this doesn't disclose any data to the attacker site, it triggers unwanted file downloads and puts load on the server as well as fills the victims disk if executed repeatedly.

We already have CSRF protection means with session-based request tokens. Requiring such tokens on download urls would add the necessary protection against these unwanted downloads.
