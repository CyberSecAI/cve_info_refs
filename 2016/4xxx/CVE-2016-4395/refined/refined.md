      "The process copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer without proper bounds checking.",

      "Send a POST request to `/proxy/SetSMHData`",

      "The `sscanf()` function is used within a loop to convert a user-supplied hex string to binary bytes and store into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.",
