{
  "CVE-2016-4483": {
    "Description": "The xmlBufAttrSerializeTxtContent function in xmlsave.c in libxml2 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a non-UTF-8 attribute value, related to serialization.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `xmlBufAttrSerializeTxtContent` function due to improper handling of non-UTF-8 attribute values during XML serialization in libxml2.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service due to an application crash. In some cases, it might also be possible to achieve code execution, though this is less commonly reported.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted XML document with non-UTF-8 attribute values"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted XML document with non-UTF-8 attribute values to the vulnerable application. The specific position depends on the application, but generally, it involves processing of malicious XML data."
