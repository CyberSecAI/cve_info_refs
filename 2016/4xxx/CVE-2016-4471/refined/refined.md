Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the ManageIQ application where an attacker with access to the appliance filesystem can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the application. This issue was introduced by an upstream commit f077196c99feb874e5cba8b93c1f8dfe26421c1b.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Privilege Escalation: The core vulnerability is that an attacker can escalate their privileges to those of the application itself.
- Arbitrary Code Execution:  The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete system compromise: Due to the ability to run arbitrary code with application privileges, the attacker could potentially gain full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File system access: The attacker must have access to the appliance filesystem to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the filesystem: The attacker requires a method to access the filesystem of the appliance where ManageIQ is running.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in CloudForms 4.1 in erratum RHBA-2016:1348.
- The upstream fix was made in the ManageIQ project, specifically with commit dbb97fcc8e89df363f79c73e4f5787067094a208, which removed the unused `RssFeed.import_from_hash` method. While the fix seems to be related to removing unused code, this code was likely a vector for the described filesystem-based attack.
