Debian Bug     : 823968

Several security issues have been discovered in the Squid caching proxy.

CVE-2016-4051:

  CESG and Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that Squid cachemgr.cgi was
  vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing remotely supplied
  inputs relayed through Squid.

CVE-2016-4052:

  CESG discovered that a buffer overflow made Squid vulnerable to a
  Denial of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses.

CVE-2016-4053:

  CESG found that Squid was vulnerable to public information
  disclosure of the server stack layout when processing ESI responses.

CVE-2016-4054:

  CESG discovered that Squid was vulnerable to remote code execution
  when processing ESI responses.

CVE-2016-4554:

  Jianjun Chen found that Squid was vulnerable to a header smuggling
  attack that could lead to cache poisoning and to bypass of
  same-origin security policy in Squid and some client browsers.

CVE-2016-4555, CVE-2016-4556:

  "bfek-18" and "@vftable" found that Squid was vulnerable to a Denial
  of Service (DoS) attack when processing ESI responses, due to
  incorrect pointer handling and reference counting.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u3.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 3.5.19-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1329136#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-04-21 09:37:00 UTC  ```  Due to buffer overflow issues Squid is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing ESI responses.  Due to incorrect input validation Squid is vulnerable to public information disclosure of the server stack layout when processing ESI responses.  Due to incorrect input validation and buffer overflow Squid is vulnerable to remote code execution when processing ESI responses.

## Synopsis

Moderate: squid security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1138)

## Topic

An update for squid is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Squid cachemgr.cgi utility processed remotely relayed Squid input. When the CGI interface utility is used, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4051)
* Buffer overflow and input validation flaws were found in the way Squid processed ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy, or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a remote attacker able to control ESI components on an HTTP server could use these flaws to crash Squid, disclose parts of the stack memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Squid. (CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054)
* An input validation flaw was found in Squid's mime\_get\_header\_field() function, which is used to search for headers within HTTP requests. An attacker could send an HTTP request from the client side with specially crafted header Host header that bypasses same-origin security protections, causing Squid operating as interception or reverse-proxy to contact the wrong origin server. It could also be used for cache poisoning for client not following RFC 7230. (CVE-2016-4554)
* An incorrect reference counting flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid is configured as reverse-proxy, for TLS/HTTPS interception, an attacker controlling a server accessed by Squid, could crash the squid worker, causing a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-4556)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2016:6
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2016:6
Date: April 20, 2016
Summary: Multiple issues in ESI processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.x -> 3.5.16
Squid 4.x -> 4.0.8
Fixed in version: Squid 3.5.17, 4.0.9
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016\_6.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4052
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4053
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4054
CESG REF: 56284998 / VULNERABILITY ID: 393536
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to buffer overflow issues Squid is vulnerable to a denial
of service attack when processing ESI responses.
Due to incorrect input validation Squid is vulnerable to public
information disclosure of the server stack layout when processing
ESI responses.
Due to incorrect input validation and buffer overflow Squid is
vulnerable to remote code execution when processing ESI
responses.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
These problems allow ESI components to be used to perform a
denial of service attack on the Squid service and all other
services on the same machine.
Under certain build conditions these problems allow remote
clients to view large sections of the server memory.
However, the bugs are exploitable only if you have built and
configured the ESI features to be used by a reverse-proxy and if
the ESI components being processed by Squid can be controlled by
an attacker.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
These bugs are fixed by Squid version 3.5.17 and 4.0.9.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for stable releases
can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.2:
Squid 3.3:
Squid 3.4:
Squid 3.5:
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
Use the command 'squid -v' to view version and build details of
your proxy;
All Squid 2.x are not vulnerable.
All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.
All Squid built without --enable-esi are not vulnerable.
Check squid.conf or use the (version 3.4+) command
(squid -k parse 2>&1) | grep "Processing: http.\*\_port"
to view the active configuration settings for your proxy;
Unpatched Squid 3.x and 4.x built with --enable-esi and
configured with 'accel' or 'vhost' or 'defaultsite=' or
'ssl-bump' on an http\_port or https\_port are vulnerable.
All Squid configured without reverse-proxy or ssl-bump are
not vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workaround:
Build Squid with --disable-esi if ESI is not needed.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your
primary support point. For subscription details see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
http://bugs.squid-cache.org/.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list. It is a closed list
(though anyone can post) and security related bug reports are
treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 276 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2136219.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2136219.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 13 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Message-ID: <57179246.30207@treenet.co.nz>
Date: Thu, 21 Apr 2016 02:29:26 +1200
From: Amos Jeffries <squid3@...enet.co.nz>

Subject: CVE Request: Squid HTTP Caching Proxy multiple issues

Hi,
 several vulnerabilities have been reported in Squid proxy.

A buffer overflow in the cachemgr.cgi tool reported by CESG (CESG REF:
56397140 / VULNERABILITY ID: 394201) allows remote clients to perform an
indirect denial of service attack on the proxy administrator. It could
be used trivially to hide other activities from inspection. Or be used
to perform remote code execution on systems without overflow protection.

This bug was also independently reported by Yuriy M. Kaminskiy.

The cachemgr.cgi tool is vulnerable when built from;
Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.16,
Squid-4.x up to and including 4.0.8, and
Squid-2.x all versions.

Upstream report will be at:
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_5.txt>>

Patches at:
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-14643.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID-2016_5.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/changesets/SQUID-2016_5.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.3/changesets/SQUID-2016_5.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/SQUID-2016_5.patch>>

Multiple on-stack buffer overflow from incorrect bounds calculation in
Squid ESI processing has been reported by CESG (CESG REF: 56284998 /
VULNERABILITY ID: 393536) which allows remote code execution or denial
of service if depending on the OS overflow protections which are active.

Further investigation has found that when compiler optimization is
applied incorrect use of assert() leads to information disclosure of
stack contents to remote clients and a second buffer overflow leads to
further remote code execution possibilities.

Squid-2.x are not vulnerable.
Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.16,
Squid-4.x up to and including 4.0.8,
 when built with --enable-esi and used for either CDN reverse-proxy or
TLS MITM are vulnerable.

Upstream report will be at:
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_6.txt>>

Patches at:
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-14648.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-14034.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/changesets/squid-3.4-13235.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.3/changesets/squid-3.3-12697.patch>>
 <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/squid-3.2-11841.patch>>

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [squid3](/security/cves?package=squid3) - Web proxy cache server

## Details

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that the Squid pinger utility incorrectly

handled certain ICMPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to

cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly cause

Squid to leak information into log files. ([CVE-2016-3947](/security/CVE-2016-3947))

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that the Squid cachemgr.cgi tool incorrectly

handled certain crafted data. A remote attacker could use this issue to

cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-4051](/security/CVE-2016-4051))

It was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain Edge Side Includes

(ESI) responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-4052](/security/CVE-2016-4052), [CVE-2016-4053](/security/CVE-2016-4053), [CVE-2016-4054](/security/CVE-2016-4054))

Jianjun Chen discovered that Squid did not correctly ignore the Host header

when absolute-URI is provided. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to conduct cache-poisoning attacks. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-4553](/security/CVE-2016-4553))

Jianjun Chen discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain HTTP Host

headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to conduct

cache-poisoning attacks. ([CVE-2016-4554](/security/CVE-2016-4554))

It was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain Edge Side Includes

(ESI) responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4555](/security/CVE-2016-4555),

[CVE-2016-4556](/security/CVE-2016-4556))

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

## Synopsis

Moderate: squid security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1139)

## Topic

An update for squid is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Squid cachemgr.cgi utility processed remotely relayed Squid input. When the CGI interface utility is used, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4051)
* Buffer overflow and input validation flaws were found in the way Squid processed ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy, or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a remote attacker able to control ESI components on an HTTP server could use these flaws to crash Squid, disclose parts of the stack memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Squid. (CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054)
* An input validation flaw was found in the way Squid handled intercepted HTTP Request messages. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the protection against issues related to CVE-2009-0801, and perform cache poisoning attacks on Squid. (CVE-2016-4553)
* An input validation flaw was found in Squid's mime\_get\_header\_field() function, which is used to search for headers within HTTP requests. An attacker could send an HTTP request from the client side with specially crafted header Host header that bypasses same-origin security protections, causing Squid operating as interception or reverse-proxy to contact the wrong origin server. It could also be used for cache poisoning for client not following RFC 7230. (CVE-2016-4554)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a malicious server could use this flaw to crash the Squid worker process. (CVE-2016-4555)
* An incorrect reference counting flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid is configured as reverse-proxy, for TLS/HTTPS interception, an attacker controlling a server accessed by Squid, could crash the squid worker, causing a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-4556)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.

## Synopsis

Moderate: squid34 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1140)

## Topic

An update for squid34 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The "squid34" packages provide version 3.4 of Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects. Note that apart from "squid34", this version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux also includes the "squid" packages which provide Squid version 3.1.

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Squid cachemgr.cgi utility processed remotely relayed Squid input. When the CGI interface utility is used, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4051)
* Buffer overflow and input validation flaws were found in the way Squid processed ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy, or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a remote attacker able to control ESI components on an HTTP server could use these flaws to crash Squid, disclose parts of the stack memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Squid. (CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054)
* An input validation flaw was found in the way Squid handled intercepted HTTP Request messages. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the protection against issues related to CVE-2009-0801, and perform cache poisoning attacks on Squid. (CVE-2016-4553)
* An input validation flaw was found in Squid's mime\_get\_header\_field() function, which is used to search for headers within HTTP requests. An attacker could send an HTTP request from the client side with specially crafted header Host header that bypasses same-origin security protections, causing Squid operating as interception or reverse-proxy to contact the wrong origin server. It could also be used for cache poisoning for client not following RFC 7230. (CVE-2016-4554)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid was used as a reverse proxy or for TLS/HTTPS interception, a malicious server could use this flaw to crash the Squid worker process. (CVE-2016-4555)
* An incorrect reference counting flaw was found in the way Squid processes ESI responses. If Squid is configured as reverse-proxy, for TLS/HTTPS interception, an attacker controlling a server accessed by Squid, could crash the squid worker, causing a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-4556)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_5.txt>
>
> A buffer overflow in the cachemgr.cgi tool reported by CESG (CESG REF:
> 56397140 / VULNERABILITY ID: 394201) allows remote clients to perform an
> indirect denial of service attack on the proxy administrator. It could
> be used trivially to hide other activities from inspection. Or be used
> to perform remote code execution on systems without overflow protection.
>
> This bug was also independently reported by Yuriy M. Kaminskiy.

Use CVE-2016-4051.

> <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_6.txt>
>
> Multiple on-stack buffer overflow from incorrect bounds calculation in
> Squid ESI processing has been reported by CESG (CESG REF: 56284998 /
> VULNERABILITY ID: 393536) which allows remote code execution or denial
> of service if depending on the OS overflow protections which are active.

Use CVE-2016-4052.

> Further investigation has found that when compiler optimization is
> applied incorrect use of assert() leads to information disclosure of
> stack contents to remote clients

Use CVE-2016-4053.

> a second buffer overflow leads to
> further remote code execution possibilities.

Use CVE-2016-4054.

bsc#968393, bsc#968394, bsc#968395)
- CVE-2016-3947: Buffer overrun issue in pinger ICMPv6 processing.
(bsc#973782)
- CVE-2015-5400: Improper protection of alternate path. (bsc#938715)
- CVE-2015-3455: Squid http proxy configured with client-first SSL bumping
did not correctly validate server certificate. (bsc#929493)
- CVE-2016-3948: Fixed denial of service in HTTP Response processing
(bsc#973783)
- CVE-2016-4051: fixes buffer overflow in cachemgr.cgi (bsc#976553)
- CVE-2016-4052, CVE-2016-4053, CVE-2016-4054: Fixed multiple issues in
ESI processing (bsc#976556)
- CVE-2016-4553: Fixed cache poisoning issue in HTTP Request handling
(bsc#979009)
- CVE-2016-4554: Fixed header smuggling issue in HTTP Request processing
(bsc#979010)
- Fixed multiple Denial of Service issues in ESI Response processing.

may never be reached.
- squid.init: wait that squid really dies when we kill it on upgrade
instead
of proclaiming its demise prematurely (bnc#963539)

It could also be used for cache poisoning for client not following RFC 7230. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2016-06-09 12:43:31 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |
