Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-4043

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass Restricted Python within the Plone CMS through crafted templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Bypass of Restricted Python:** The core weakness is that the restricted Python environment, meant to limit code execution, can be circumvented by users with sufficient privileges.
*   **Template Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious code through templates, specifically affecting the Chameleon template engine (five.pt).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While the vulnerability requires initial administrative or template editing access, it effectively allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to full system control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Template Editing:** An attacker needs the ability to create or edit templates within Plone.
*   **Specific Template Engine:** This vulnerability is specific to the Chameleon template engine (five.pt).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Access (usually):** Typically, the attacker needs administrator privileges, providing access to the Zope Management Interface (ZMI).
*   **Template Editing Permission:** Alternatively, users granted permission to edit PloneFormGen templates can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Plone 5 by default because it uses the vulnerable Chameleon package, and Plone 4 if the Chameleon package is added.
*   The provided information is more detailed than the CVE description, specifying the exact mechanism of the bypass and the affected Plone versions.
