**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: Specifically, an invalid font file can trigger memory corruption when processed by Adobe Acrobat/Reader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Remote code execution: A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
-  Access to dynamically allocated memory: The vulnerability allows an attacker to access parts of dynamically allocated memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Remote attack vector: The attack is delivered through a specially crafted PDF file.
-  User interaction required:  The user must open the malicious PDF file for the exploit to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious PDF: The attacker must be capable of creating a PDF document with an embedded malicious TrueType font.
-  Ability to deliver the malicious PDF: The attacker needs a method to deliver the malicious PDF to the victim, such as via email or a website.
-  No special network position: The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, as the PDF file is typically delivered remotely.
