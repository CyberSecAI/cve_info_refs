- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An access control issue in the Address Book.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how the Address Book manages access permissions, allowing an application to maintain access even after that access was revoked in Settings. This indicates a problem in the file-link validation mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An application can continue to access and potentially exfiltrate contact information even after the user has explicitly revoked access through device settings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via a malicious application installed on the device which exploits this vulnerability to retain unauthorized access to the address book.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a malicious application installed on the target device. The application must have previously been granted access to the address book before the user attempts to revoke access.
