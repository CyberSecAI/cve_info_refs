  "CVE-2016-4992": {
    "related": true,
    "description": "An information disclosure flaw was found in 389 Directory Server. A user with no access to objects in certain LDAP sub-tree could send LDAP ADD operations with a specific object name. The error message returned to the user was different based on whether the target object existed or not.",
    "root_cause": "The 389 Directory Server, when handling LDAP ADD operations, incorrectly returns different error messages depending on whether a target object exists. This behavior allows an unprivileged user to infer the existence of entries they shouldn't have access to.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can infer the existence of RDN component objects, which they shouldn't have access to. This could potentially lead to further attacks if the revealed information is sensitive.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access via LDAP"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires network access to the LDAP server and the ability to send LDAP ADD operations, but does not require any prior privilege on the server. The attacker needs to know (or be able to guess) the potential object name to be tested."
