Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-4071:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a format string error in the `php_snmp_error()` function within the PHP SNMP extension. This function takes the `snmp_object->snmp_errstr` directly and passes it to `zend_throw_exception_ex()` without proper sanitization, specifically lacking a `%s` format specifier.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of the input string (`snmp_errstr`) within `zend_throw_exception_ex()`, which allows format string specifiers to be interpreted, leading to potential code execution.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The `snmp_errstr` from the SNMP object is not properly sanitized before being used in `zend_throw_exception_ex()`.
*   **Integer Overflow:** It was identified in at least one SUSE advisory that a related vulnerability existed in `php_raw_url_encode()`.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious format string specifiers through a specially crafted SNMP request.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting the vulnerability could also lead to a crash of the PHP application, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Heap Overflow:** A related vulnerability in libgd allows for a heap overflow when processing compressed gd2 data, when a negative chunk size is provided.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a malformed SNMP request with a specially crafted `snmp_errstr`.
*   **SNMP Requests:** The attack vector involves utilizing the SNMP extension in PHP.
*   **Malicious GD2 Data:** A related vulnerability can be triggered by sending malformed compressed gd2 data.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SNMP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SNMP:** The attacker needs to understand how the SNMP extension works in PHP to craft a malicious request.
*   **Ability to trigger the error:** The attacker must be able to cause an error to occur in php\_snmp\_error(), where the crafted string will be used.

**Additional Details from the Analysis:**

*   The `gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx()` and `gdImageCreateFromGd2PartCtx()` functions in `libgd` are susceptible to a heap overflow if a negative chunk size is present in the compressed gd2 data. The vulnerability is caused by the use of a signed integer to store chunk sizes which, when negative, results in undersized allocations for compressed image data.
*   The `php_raw_url_encode` function in PHP is also vulnerable to an integer overflow when handling very large strings.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) exploit exists that demonstrates how to use the libgd vulnerability to achieve remote code execution. This exploit is available on GitHub and uses Python.
*   The vulnerability impacts several versions of PHP, including versions 5.5.x, 5.6.x, and 7.x and the bundled libgd library.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by sanitizing the `snmp_errstr` parameter before being used in `zend_throw_exception_ex()` and rejecting invalid filenames when parsing phar archives.
*   The issue is a signedness vulnerability in the bundled libgd library that may lead to a heap overflow.
*   The size is subsequently interpreted as a size\_t by `fread()` or `memcpy()`, depending on how the image is read
*   The size is read by `gdGetInt()`

**Content that seems unrelated to the CVE:**

*   The SUSE CVE page mentions CVE-2016-4070, CVE-2016-4073, CVE-2015-8866, and CVE-2015-8867. These are separate CVEs, although they are related to the same set of PHP updates as well as CVE-2016-3074.
*   The various release notes and changelogs for PHP versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 describe fixes for a large number of bugs and vulnerabilities. While many of them are related to security, they are not directly connected to CVE-2016-4071.
*  The SUSE CVE page mentions  `www.zerodayinitiative.com` advisories that seems to be for a different vulnerability `CVE-2016-4070`.
