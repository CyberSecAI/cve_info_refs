Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-4158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unquoted service path in the Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unquoted Service Path Enumeration:** The service path for the Creative Cloud Desktop Application was not enclosed in quotes. This weakness allows for the possibility of privilege escalation by exploiting how Windows handles service paths with spaces.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This allows the attacker to gain control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to introduce a malicious executable into a directory within the service's unquoted path. When the service tries to start, it may be tricked into executing the attacker's malicious code instead of intended executables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to a location within the search path used by the vulnerable service, which is typically a location where standard users would not have write access. This might require a foothold in the system first.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Creative Cloud Desktop Application version 3.6.0.248 and earlier versions on Windows.
- The fix is included in version 3.7.0.272 and later.
- The vulnerability was reported by Cyril Vallicari / Ug\_0 Security and Security team Netservice de Toekomst.
