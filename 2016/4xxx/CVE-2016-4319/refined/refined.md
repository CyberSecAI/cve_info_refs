Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/auditing/settings` resource in Jira Server was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application did not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to potentially forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially manipulate audit log settings, likely by sending a forged request that the application would interpret as a legitimate action by a logged-in administrator.
*   The specific impact depends on what settings could be changed through the vulnerable endpoint. The provided text doesn't specify the exact settings.
*  Since the audit logs keep track of administrative changes, manipulating these logs could hinder the detection of unauthorized activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  An attacker would trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link that sends a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the request format that is sent to `/auditing/settings`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Target User Authentication:** The attacker does not need the direct credentials for a Jira admin, but needs to target a Jira admin while they are logged in.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to lure a Jira administrator to click a malicious link or visit a malicious webpage that would trigger the CSRF attack.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jira server the victim is using.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in JIRA Server versions up to 7.1.4 and was fixed in version 7.1.9 and is available in Jira Cloud.
*   The issue is labeled with "csrf" and "xsrf" suggesting both terms are used to identify the issue.
* The issue was reported by lukasz.plonka324392336.
