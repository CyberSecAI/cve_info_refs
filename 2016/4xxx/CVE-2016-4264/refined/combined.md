I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Adobe ColdFusion <= 11 XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
"Adobe ColdFusion 11 Enterprise Edition offers a single platform to
rapidly build and deploy scalable, high-performing web and mobile
applications. Leverage unique capabilities to develop, test, and debug
mobile applications end to end. Generate high-quality PDF files and
manipulate them easily."
http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html
ColdFusion is widely deployed. A google search for a ColdFusion index file
(index.cfm) exposes over 30 million websites of various sectors that make use
of ColdFusion platform in a visible way:
https://www.google.com/?q=inurl:%2Findex.cfm
including various government websites:
https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:index.cfm+site:gov
III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
An independent research revealed that Adobe ColdFusion in versions 11 and below
is vulnerable to XXE Injection when processing untrusted office documents.
Depending on web application's functionality and the attacker's ability to
supply a malicious document to be processed by a vulnerable ColdFusion
application, this vulnerability may potentially be exploited by both
low-privileged and unauthenticated remote attackers.
This vulnerability can allow various attacks including:
- reading arbitrary files (stored on the server and within the network shares)
- listing web/system directories
- SSRF attacks / unauthorized access to restricted services running on the localhost
as well as within the victim's server network
- SMB relay attacks
- temporary file uploads which may be used by attackers in combination with LFI
vulnerabilities to supply malicious code
This advisory provides a PoC exploit that demonstrates how a remote attacker
could read arbitrary files from the target server, as well as list directories.
Ability to read arbitrary files could for example let attackers extract sensitive
information such as ColdFusion password hashes of the management console or stored
database credentials.
This could allow unauthorized access to weakly protected ColdFusion management
interfaces and let attackers upload malicious code which could be used to fully
compromise the server.
IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The XXE vulnerability was found in the Office Open XML (OOXML) processing
functions which are utilised when opening documents that use XML structure.
Documents that are commonly stored in this format include:
- DOCX (Word documents)
- XLSX (Excel spreadsheets)
- PPTX (PowerPoint presentations)
More information about the format can be found in:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office\_Open\_XML
The vulnerability is caused by an unrestricted XML parser which allows
for external XML entities processing when parsing such document.
Many web applications often accept OOXML documents from their users to process
documents of various purposes, for example:
- invoices
- bank statements
- bills
- tax forms
- inventory
- CVs / cover letters
- application forms
etc.
Such upload functionality is often exposed to low-privileged or even
unauthenticated remote users.
If an attacker is able to upload a specially crafted OOXML document
which is later processed by an application written in Adobe ColdFusion,
they may be able to perform various malicious actions including
arbitrary file reading and directory listing as mentioned in the
introduction.
This could for example be used by malicious users to read sensitive
ColdFusion config files such as:
- neo-security.xml , which stores ColdFusion admin's password hash salt
- password.properties , which stores admin's password hash
- neo-datasource.xml , which stores database credentials
that are stored in c:\ColdFusion11\cfusion\lib\ directory by default on Windows
installations.
Attackers might also access the application sourcecodes within the documentroot:
c:\ColdFusion11\cfusion\wwwroot
or access other sensitive system files available within the system.
As the vulnerability also allows browsing the filesystem and its directories,
attackers may easily find interesting files and ColdFusion config/webroot
directories even if the paths differ from the default ones.
Attackers who have gained access to password hashes could then proceed
to cracking them in order to gain unauthorised access to the databases and
ColdFusion administrator panels to fully compromise the target.
More information on hashes used by ColdFusion 11 can be found in the references
below.
The next section presents a PoC exploit that can be used for file/directory
retrieval.
The exploit will work even if the target ColdFusion application does not return
any data back to the attacker upon processing a malicious document file.
The extracted data will be sent over the network back to the attacker as soon
as the document file is processed.
V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
-------------------------
An example vulnerable ColdFusion application written in CFML language
which loads a spreadsheet document could look as follows:
---[ vulnerable.cfm ]---

#xlsdoc#
------------------------
For simplicity, this ColdFusion application will load cf\_poc\_exploit.xlsx
document from the current directory.
In a real-world situation the application would allow a user to upload a
document from their disk or alternatively fetch it from a URL.
Attacker could use the exploit below to prepare a malicious document and
supply it to a vulnerable ColdFusion application.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
The vulnerability can be abused by low-privileged or unauthenticated remote
attackers depending on application's functionality and lead to sensitive
information disclosure. It can allow attackers to read arbitrary files or
expose internal services running on the server and within the local network.
Attackers could for example read stored password hashes or database credentials
which may aid attackers with gaining access to ColdFusion admin interface.
Extracting application sourcecodes could also be of use to attackers and help
them to find other vulnerabilities to fully compromise an affected target.
VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
ColdFusion installations before:
- ColdFusion 11 Update 10
- ColdFusion 10 Update 21
are affected by this vulnerability.
VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Update to ColdFusion 11 Update 10 which include critical hotfixes released by
the vendor upon initial private disclosure to Adobe. Alternatively users can
upgrade their installation to ColdFusion 2016 which is not affected.
The vulnerability fix/advisory has been assigned APSB16-30 id by Adobe.

You can see the exploit in action in a PoC video at:

http://legalhackers.com/videos/ColdFusion-XXE-PoC-Exploit

There are also two examples below:

A) Reading c:/ColdFusion11/cfusion/lib/neo-security.xml file which contains admin hash salt:

root@trusty:~/exploit# ./cf_xxe_exploit.py 192.168.57.10 c:/ColdFusion11/cfusion/lib/neo-security.xml

(CVE-2016-4264) ColdFusion <= 11   XXE / Arbitrary File Read PoC exploit

This exploit produces a PoC OOXML spreadsheet document with XXE payload that can be
uploaded to a vulnerable ColdFusion application.
It starts up an ftp/data receiver (port 9090) as well as a web server (port 8080)
in order to retrieve an arbitrary file from the victim (upon processing the PoC spreadsheet).

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

The vulnerability can be abused by low-privileged or unauthenticated remote
attackers depending on application's functionality and lead to sensitive
information disclosure. It can allow attackers to read arbitrary files or
expose internal services running on the server and within the local network.

Attackers could for example read stored password hashes or database credentials
which may aid attackers with gaining access to ColdFusion admin interface.
Extracting application sourcecodes could also be of use to attackers and help
them to find other vulnerabilities to fully compromise an affected target.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

ColdFusion installations before:

- ColdFusion 11 Update 10
- ColdFusion 10	Update 21

are affected by this vulnerability.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

Update to ColdFusion 11 Update 10 which include critical hotfixes released by
the vendor upon initial private disclosure to Adobe. Alternatively users can
upgrade their installation to ColdFusion 2016 which is not affected.

The vulnerability fix/advisory has been assigned APSB16-30 id by Adobe.

Links to the critical Adobe hotfix patches can be found in the references below.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)
