Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4083:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the MS-WSP dissector of Wireshark. The dissector is responsible for parsing and interpreting network packets using the MS-WSP protocol. A flaw in this dissector can lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The specific weakness is not detailed, but it is described as a crashing issue in the MS-WSP dissector when handling malformed packets. The root cause is likely an error in the parsing logic of the dissector, which could cause a segmentation fault, buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
Attackers can trigger this vulnerability either by:
1. Injecting a malformed MS-WSP packet onto the network that Wireshark is monitoring.
2. Convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file containing a malformed MS-WSP packet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to either inject network traffic or provide a manipulated capture file to the victim. An attacker within the same network segment could perform the injection. Otherwise the attacker must find a way to deliver a malicious packet capture file to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue affects Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.2.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Wireshark version 2.0.3.
- The issue is also documented as Wireshark issue 12341.
- The bug was found by a fuzzer.
