The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs related to Apache Ambari, and **CVE-2016-4976** is among them.

Here's the extracted information for CVE-2016-4976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Ambari executes the kadmin command for managing principals in an MIT KDC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- KDC administrator credentials could be captured by a user with access to the Ambari server host because the password was being passed as a command-line argument.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the Ambari server host could potentially capture the KDC administrator's credentials. This would allow the attacker to gain complete control over the Kerberos environment in the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to the Ambari server host. This suggests that an attacker needs some level of access to the system where the Ambari server is running.
- The attacker then captures the kadmin command execution with the password as a command-line argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Ambari server host to be able to intercept the kadmin command and its arguments.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was to change the way Ambari sends passwords to the kadmin command. Instead of including the password in the command-line arguments, Ambari now sends passwords through the command's STDIN channel.
- The vulnerable versions are Ambari 2.0.0 to 2.2.2. The fixed version is 2.4.0.
