Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability present in the `ber-decoder.c` file of the libksba library. Specifically, there are cases in the code where no attempt is made to check for integer overflows when performing addition operations, e.g. when adding 100 to a value during memory allocation, and when incrementing a length variable (`+= d->val.length`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code directly adds a constant (100) or another variable (`d->val.length`) to a size-related variable without ensuring the result doesn't exceed the maximum value of the data type. This can lead to a wraparound, resulting in a small or negative value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The integer overflow can lead to incorrect memory allocation sizes, which could potentially cause a crash when writing to the allocated memory. It can also corrupt internal data structures if the size calculation is used for indexing or other operations.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In some scenarios, integer overflows can lead to memory corruption that can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The Ubuntu advisory mentions that this issue could "possibly execute arbitrary code".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted BER Data:** An attacker can craft specific BER data with lengths that, when processed by the vulnerable code in `ber-decoder.c`, trigger the integer overflow during memory allocation or size calculations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted BER data to a service or application using the vulnerable libksba library. This means the attacker can be either:
    *  Local if the malicious input comes from a local file.
    * Remote if the vulnerable code is processing data coming from the network.
    *  An attacker with the ability to inject malicious input into the system.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was identified and reported by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
*   The fix involves not just using the correct data type (CVE-2016-4354) but also implementing explicit overflow checks using `sum_a1_a2_ge_b` function and additional checks before `malloc` calls.
*   The issue affects multiple Ubuntu versions (12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 15.10, 16.04).
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and can lead to a denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.

In summary, CVE-2016-4355 highlights a critical integer overflow vulnerability in libksba's BER decoder due to the lack of proper bounds checking when incrementing sizes during processing BER data.
