{
  "CVE-2016-4443": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in RHEV Manager, where it wrote sensitive data to the engine-setup log file. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive information such as encryption keys and certificates (which could then be used to steal other sensitive information such as passwords).",
    "Root cause": "The Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHEV-M) wrote sensitive information, including encryption keys and certificates, to the engine-setup log file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive information disclosure",
       "Logging of sensitive data"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could gain access to sensitive information such as encryption keys and certificates, which could then be used to steal other sensitive information like passwords, and gain unauthorized access to the system.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the server where RHEV-M is installed"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the server and read access to the engine-setup log file."
