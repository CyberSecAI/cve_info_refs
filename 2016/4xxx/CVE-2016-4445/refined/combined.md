CVE-2016-4989 was assigned to the issues above.

There are additional similar problems in setroubleshoot and
setroubleshoot-plugins:

- CVE-2016-4445, setroubleshoot, affecting 'sealert --fix'.  Problem was
  already fixed in version 3.2.23.

  <https://github.com/fedora-selinux/setroubleshoot/commit/2d12677629ca319310f6263688bb1b7f676c01b7>

- CVE-2016-4444, setroubleshoot-plugins, allow_execmod plugin.  Also
  previously fixed in versoin 3.2.23.

  <https://github.com/fedora-selinux/setroubleshoot/commit/5cd60033ea7f5bdf8c19c27b23ea2d773d9b09f5>

- CVE-2016-4446, setroubleshoot-plugins, allow_execstack plugin.
  Similar to the previous one, only using commands.getoutput instead of
  commands.getstatusoutput.

## Synopsis

Important: setroubleshoot and setroubleshoot-plugins security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1267)

## Topic

An update for setroubleshoot and setroubleshoot-plugins is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The setroubleshoot packages provide tools to help diagnose SELinux problems. When Access Vector Cache (AVC) messages are returned, an alert can be generated that provides information about the problem and helps to track its resolution.

The setroubleshoot-plugins package provides a set of analysis plugins for use with setroubleshoot. Each plugin has the capacity to analyze SELinux AVC data and system data to provide user friendly reports describing how to interpret SELinux AVC denials.

Security Fix(es):

* Shell command injection flaws were found in the way the setroubleshoot executed external commands. A local attacker able to trigger certain SELinux denials could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2016-4445, CVE-2016-4989)
* Shell command injection flaws were found in the way the setroubleshoot allow\_execmod and allow\_execstack plugins executed external commands. A local attacker able to trigger an execmod or execstack SELinux denial could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2016-4444, CVE-2016-4446)

The CVE-2016-4444 and CVE-2016-4446 issues were discovered by Milos Malik (Red Hat) and the CVE-2016-4445 and CVE-2016-4989 issues were discovered by Red Hat Product Security.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1339183#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-24 10:49:55 UTC  ``` It was discovered that sealert executed external fix commands using commands.getstatusoutput() without properly sanitizing untrusted inputs used as command arguments.  These inputs originated from SELinux AVC messages.  A local user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as root if they could trigger an SELinux denial using a file with a specially crafted name.  The use of commands.getstatusoutput() was already removed upstream via the following commit:  <https://github.com/fedora-selinux/setroubleshoot/commit/2d12677629ca319310f6263688bb1b7f676c01b7>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1339183#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-24 10:53:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Red Hat Product Security   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1339183#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2016-06-21 11:36:48 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1339183#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-21 21:24:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:1267 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1267](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1267)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1339183#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2016-06-22 09:04:59 UTC  ``` This issue was fixed upstream in version 3.2.23.  The setroubleshoot packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 were updated from version 3.2.17 to version 3.2.24 via RHBA-2015:2287, released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2015-2287.html>  Therefore, this issue was corrected in that update.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-24 13:17:49 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the allow_execstack setroubleshoot plugin executes external commands using the commands.getoutput() without properly sanitizing untrusted inputs used as command arguments.  These inputs originated from SELinux AVC messages.  A local user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as root if they could trigger an SELinux execstack denial using a file with a specially crafted name.  The similar problem was reported for allow_execmod plugin too, related to the use of commands.getstatusoutput(), see [bug 1339183](show_bug.cgi?id=1339183 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-4445 setroubleshoot: insecure use of commands.getstatusoutput in sealert").   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-24 13:17:54 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Milos Malik (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-25 12:58:22 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect the default SELinux configuration, as the execstack is allowed by default for unconfined_t domain.  SELinux booleans allow_execstack (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6) or selinuxuser_execstack (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) can be set to off to disallow execstack, and hence make it possible to generate execstack AVC, which triggers this bug.  The impact of this issue on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 and later is reduced, as setroubleshootd does not run with root privileges, but with privileges of a dedicated non-root user setroubleshoot.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2016-06-21 11:39:15 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2016-06-21 11:46:16 UTC  ```  Created setroubleshoot-plugins tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1348527](show_bug.cgi?id=1348527 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-4446 setroubleshoot-plugins: insecure commands.getoutput use in the allow_execstack plugin [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2016-06-21 20:52:55 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/fedora-selinux/setroubleshoot/commit/eaccf4c0d20a27d3df5ff6de8c9dcc80f6f40718>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-21 21:25:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:1267 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1267](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1267)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-23 08:53:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:1293 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1293](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1293)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1339250#c11)  Fedora Update System    2016-06-23 17:52:57 UTC  ``` setroubleshoot-plugins-3.3.5.1-1.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.
