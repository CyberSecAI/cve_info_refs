  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-4445",
    "description": "Shell command injection flaws were found in the way the setroubleshoot executed external commands. A local attacker able to trigger certain SELinux denials could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "affected_components": [
      "setroubleshoot"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `sealert` tool in setroubleshoot used `commands.getstatusoutput()` to execute external fix commands without properly sanitizing untrusted inputs (derived from SELinux AVC messages) used as command arguments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with root privileges.",
    "attack_vector": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger specific SELinux denials with specially crafted file names.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is fixed in setroubleshoot version 3.2.23. The vulnerability exists because the `sealert` tool uses `commands.getstatusoutput` to execute external commands with unsanitized input from SELinux AVC messages.\n\nsetroubleshoot versions prior to 3.2.23 are vulnerable."
