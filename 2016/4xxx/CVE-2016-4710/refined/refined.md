Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4710:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a type confusion error within the CoreGraphics module in Apple OS X WindowServer. Specifically, the issue arises from the failure to properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Type confusion: The vulnerability exists because the WindowServer does not properly validate the type of data received from a user, leading to a type confusion.
- Insufficient input validation:  User-supplied data is not properly validated, which allows for the type confusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A successful exploit allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to the context of the WindowServer. This effectively grants the attacker root privileges.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: With the escalated privileges, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This means an attacker must already have some level of access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Code Execution: The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
- Low Privileges: The attacker can begin from a low privilege level.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the CoreGraphics module.
- Apple has released a patch to correct the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple on 2016-06-14, and the advisory was released on 2016-11-15.
- The vulnerability is described as "Apple OS X WindowServer \_XSetPreferencesForWorkspaces Type Confusion Privilege Escalation Vulnerability".
- The vulnerability is also listed in the macOS Sierra 10.12 security content document, confirming its impact and remediation.
