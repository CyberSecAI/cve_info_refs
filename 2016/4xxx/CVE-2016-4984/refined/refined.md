The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `openldap-servers` package, specifically within the `/usr/libexec/openldap/generate-server-cert.sh` script.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The script generates a password file and initially creates it with insecure permissions, which are then corrected after the fact. This creates a window of opportunity for a local attacker to read the password file before permissions are updated. Also the password generated is the same for all instances, not unique for each one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure file creation: The password file is created with world-readable permissions before the permissions are changed to more restrictive ones.
- Lack of unique passwords: The generated password is not unique per instance or install because it is created at RPM install time, not at first run.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: An attacker could potentially read the password file during the time window where it has world-readable permissions.
- Shared password across all instances: all containers and image instances created would share the same password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: A local attacker who has access to the system during the brief window between the file creation and permission change can read the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system
- Ability to observe file creation and changes on disk
