Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the Application Specific Packet Filtering (ASPF) function of several Huawei products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The ASPF function does not properly validate the parameters in network packets, allowing a crafted malformed packet to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the affected device to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Potentially, an attacker could execute malicious code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker sends a malformed network packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the network where the vulnerable device resides. They must be able to send network packets to the device.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a malformed packet containing illegitimate parameters that will trigger the buffer overflow in the ASPF function.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects multiple Huawei products: USG series, NGFW Module, IPS Module, NIP series, and AntiDDoS8000.
- **Specific Versions:** The vulnerability is present in version V500R001C00 of the mentioned products.
- **Fixes:** Huawei has released software updates (V500R001C20SPC100) to address the vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv2 base score of 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), indicating a high severity.
- **Temporary Fix:** As a temporary workaround, deploying Huawei NGFWs or data center firewalls and upgrading the IPS signature database to the latest version (IPS\_H20011000\_2016050400) to detect and defend against exploits.
