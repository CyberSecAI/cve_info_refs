Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `read_binary` function within the `buffer.c` file of pgpdump. This function lacks proper error and End-of-File (EOF) checking while reading input from stdin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The `read_binary` function does not validate the input stream correctly, specifically not checking for errors or EOF conditions. This allows a specially crafted input to cause a denial-of-service.
- **Infinite Loop/Denial of Service:** When pgpdump receives a specific input, such as `\xa3\x03`, the missing error checks in `read_binary` cause the program to enter an infinite loop, consuming 100% of CPU resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the pgpdump program to enter an endless loop and consume all available CPU resources, effectively rendering the program unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input to pgpdump:** The primary attack vector is through providing maliciously crafted input to the pgpdump application, specifically to its stdin. This can be done by piping input from a command line or through an interface where user input is provided to pgpdump.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `pgpdump` program. This could be through direct command-line execution, via an application that uses `pgpdump` or potentially on a webserver, though the latter is considered rare for this specific vulnerability based on the provided text.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in pgpdump version 0.30.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Klaus Eisentraut of SySS GmbH.
-  A patch was created by SySS GmbH and provided to the maintainer as a pull request on github.
- The CVE was assigned despite initial reservations due to the relatively low impact and unusual nature of the vector.

This vulnerability is related to how pgpdump handles input, making it susceptible to a denial-of-service attack with crafted input.
