Symphony is a XSLT-powered open source content management system.
Vulnerability Type:
===================
Session Fixation
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-4309
Vulnerability Details:
=====================
Symphony CMS is prone to "Session Fixation" allowing attackers to preset a users PHPSESSID "Session Identifier".
If the application is deployed using an insecure setup with PHP.INI "session.use\_only\_cookies" not enabled, attackers can then send
victims a link to the vulnerable application with the "PHPSESSID" already initialized as Symphony does not use or call
"session\_regenerate\_id()" upon successful user authentication.
Note: as per php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php "session.use\_only\_cookies=1" is default since PHP 4.3.0.
e.g.
"http://localhost/symphony/?PHPSESSID=APPARITION666".
As Symphonys Session ID is not regenerated it can result in arbitrary Session ID being 'Fixated' to a user, if that user authenticates using
this attacker supplied session fixated link, the attacker can now access the affected application from a different Computer/Browser
and have the same level of access to that of the victim. Default Cookie lifetime for Symphony CMS is up to two weeks.
Reproduction steps:
=====================
Edit PHP.INI and change following settings to 'session.use\_only\_cookies=0' if applicable, as POC test.
1) Telnet localhost 80
2) make HTTP request with a prefixed PHPSESSID
GET /symphony-2.6.7/symphony/?PHPSESSID=PWN3D666 HTTP/1.1

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Better php.ini overrides for insecure setups

This change is to protect our users against a poorly setup server. PHP
can allow pretty scary things security-wise, so it's best to make sure
things that can only have one valid setting should be enforced.

Thanks to [@hyp3rlinx](https://github.com/hyp3rlinx) for this.

I have always switched off `trans_sid` if possible. Regarding the other two parameters, I don't know much about 'em. But I like making PHP stuff more secure!

I have no idea if this will improve security, because I don't know **what** is hashed (by PHP/Symphony) into a session ID.

> I don't know what is hashed

Looks to me like it's random bytes from urandom: <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/d5914d19eb5c78b9c1d4e3dc6048cfaeb5b39e68/ext/session/session.c#L866>

> session.hash\_function allows you to specify the hash algorithm used to generate the session IDs

I don't get it, despite the long explanation on Stackoverflow. If it's just an ID generated from hashed random numbers, how can this make a difference? If an attacker gets your session ID, are you not lost anyway?

Nevertheless, it surely wouldn't be bad to use a stronger algorithm. (The fact that I don't get it does probably not mean that it's useless!)

> The fact that I don't get it does probably not mean that it's useless

LOL. I, too, do not fully get why a stronger hash on random data would be better. But, as far as I can tell, it's only a matter of "risk of collision", meaning, how hard it is to "guess" or "predicts" valid session ids. It's not a matter of not being able to "steal" it. Since the id persists a lot of time, one could try them all and brute force their way into it. Sha1 produces longer ids, hence, it would be harder to brute force.

Hmmm, I wonder why my Symphony session IDs are 26 characters only. An MD5 hash should be 32 characters, a SHA-1 hash would be 40 characters long.

[@hyp3rlinx](https://github.com/hyp3rlinx) [@brendo](https://github.com/brendo) Should we set it to 5 or 6 ? The goal here is to provide sensible defaults, so should we check the current value and only act when it's not considered "secure/safe" ?

We could take learnings from the `HttpFoundation` component and move all of this to the user's control. Theoretically the defaults set by [php](http://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php) are already the sensible defaults, so the changes we are making are already assuming that we know better than the defaults (sometimes true!).

> component and move all of this to the user's control.

Isn't this what we already have, i.e. via custom php.ini files ? Some host do not allow them, so should it be config values ? I would do it for values that can have multiple secure-wise valid values...

> why my Symphony session IDs are 26 characters only.

I have 32 chars ones and my `session.hash_bits_per_character = 4` so the value works as expected. Funny that one would only want half of the bytes to mean something ;)

After a bunch of reading and testing, hash config should be a server thing. We are not making more secure as custom values can be even more secure. Default values are sensible enough. I will change my php.ini settings accordingly. Case closed. Thanks 👍
