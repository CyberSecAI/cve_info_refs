Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Symphony CMS not regenerating the session ID upon successful user authentication. This allows an attacker to fixate a user's session ID by sending a crafted link with a pre-set `PHPSESSID`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The application does not call `session_regenerate_id()` after a user logs in.
- **Insecure PHP configuration:** The vulnerability is exploitable if the PHP configuration `session.use_only_cookies` is disabled (set to 0). While this is not the default, it is a potential configuration issue on vulnerable deployments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** If a user logs in using a manipulated link with a preset session ID, the attacker can then use that same ID to access the application from a different browser or computer with the victimâ€™s access level.
- **Full Account Access:** The attacker gains the same level of access as the authenticated user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that include a specific `PHPSESSID` parameter. This link can be delivered to a victim via phishing emails, social media, or other methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** Attackers need to be able to create and distribute links containing the `PHPSESSID` parameter.
- **Victim Interaction:** The victim must click the malicious link and log into the vulnerable application.
- **Vulnerable PHP configuration:** The targeted server needs to have `session.use_only_cookies` set to 0.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided GitHub commit addresses the issue by enforcing `session.use_only_cookies` to be set to '1', along with `session.use_trans_sid` to '0' and `session.use_strict_mode` to '1' in Symphony CMS code. This fix is a defense in depth measure because the default value for `session.use_only_cookies` is '1' since PHP 4.3.0
- The fix was released on May 23, 2016
- The default cookie lifetime for Symphony CMS sessions is mentioned to be up to two weeks, which increases the potential impact of successful session hijacking.
