# Jenkins Security Advisory 2016-06-20

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in these Jenkins plugins:

* [Async Http Client Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/async-http-client)
* [Build Failure Analyzer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-failure-analyzer)
* [Image Gallery Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/image-gallery)
* [TAP Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/tap)

## Description

### Path traversal vulnerability in TAP Plugin

**SECURITY-85 / CVE-2016-4986**

The plugin did not correctly filter a parameter and allowed reading arbitrary files on the file system.

### Path traversal vulnerability in Image Gallery Plugin

**SECURITY-278 / CVE-2016-4987**

The plugin did not correctly validate form fields and allowed listing arbitrary directories and reading arbitrary files on the file system.

### Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Build Failure Analyzer Plugin

**SECURITY-290 / CVE-2016-4988**

The plugin did not escape a parameter echoed on an HTML page, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.

### Async HTTP Client Plugin does not properly validate certificates

**SECURITY-305 / CVE-2013-7397 and CVE-2013-7398**

Async HTTP Client Plugin provides the Async HTTP Client Java library to other plugins. It is based on the 1.7.x line of AHC, which by default is vulnerable to [CVE-2013-7397](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7397) and [CVE-2013-7398](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7398), allowing man-in-the-middle attacks. The fixes for these vulnerabilities were backported. The system property `jenkins.plugins.asynchttpclient.AHC.acceptAnyCertificate` can temporarily be set to `true` to disable these new validity checks.
