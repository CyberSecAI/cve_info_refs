**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the `viewmyprofile.action` resource of Atlassian Confluence.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when displaying user profile information, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's profile. This code would then execute in the browsers of other users who view the compromised profile. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
- Session hijacking: stealing user session cookies to impersonate the victim
- Defacement: altering the appearance of the viewed profile page or surrounding pages
- Redirecting to malicious sites
- Data theft
- Further attacks on internal systems

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `viewmyprofile.action` resource. An attacker would need to inject malicious code into the vulnerable input fields. This malicious code is then stored and executed when another user views the compromised profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to have an account on the affected Confluence instance, which allows them to modify their profile details.

**Versions Affected:**
- 5.9.9
- 5.9.10
