**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Splunk Web.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, and defacing the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack is carried out via the web interface of Splunk.
* The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application. When another user accesses the page containing the injected code, the script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to log in to the system, either as an administrator or as a user with sufficient privileges to inject the malicious script.
* The attacker needs to manipulate the application to store the XSS payload.
* The target user needs to access the manipulated page for the attack to be successful.
