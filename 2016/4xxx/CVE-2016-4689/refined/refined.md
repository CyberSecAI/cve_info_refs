- **Root cause of vulnerability**: S/MIME policy failed to check if a certificate was valid.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to validate the revocation status of S/MIME certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An email signed with a revoked certificate may appear valid, potentially leading users to trust malicious emails.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted email signed with a revoked certificate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to possess a revoked certificate and be able to send emails to the vulnerable user.
