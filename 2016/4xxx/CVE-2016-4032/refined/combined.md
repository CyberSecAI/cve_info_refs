# Modem interface exposed via USB

* *Authors*: Roberto Paleari ([@rpaleari](https://twitter.com/rpaleari)) and Aristide Fattori ([@joystick](https://twitter.com/joystick))
* *Samsung ID*: SVE-2016-5301
* *ID*: CVE-2016-4030, CVE-2016-4031, CVE-2016-4032
* *Notification date*: 11/12/2015
* *Release date*: 11/04/2016

Some months ago we
[tweeted a video](https://twitter.com/rpaleari/status/674983960162787328)
showing a "lock screen bypass" on a Samsung Galaxy S6 phone. In this post
we provide the technical details behind that attack.

In a nutshell, when connected to a USB master (e.g., a normal laptop), Samsung
Android phones expose (or can be *forced* to expose) a serial interface which can
be exploited to communicate with the USB modem.

This communication channel is active even when both USB tethering and USB
debugging (i.e., ADB) are disabled, and can be accessed even when the device is
locked. An attacker who gains physical access to a (possibly locked) device can
thus use this interface to send arbitrary AT commands to the modem. This
permits to perform several actions that should be forbidden by the lock
mechanism, including placing phone calls or sending SMS messages.

As a foreword, consider that in the following we assume that "USB debugging" is
*not* enabled on the target device. When ADB is enabled, things are way too
easy :-)

## How does it work?

For old Samsung devices and firmware versions, such as the GT-I9192 (Samsung S4
Mini with build I9192XXUBNB1), just plugging the smartphone into a Linux host
exposes a usb-serial modem, accessible using the corresponding Linux device
(e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`). After connecting to the modem through this interface,
it is possible to send certain AT commands, some of which are delivered to the
baseband modem while others are processed by user-space applications.

Exploitation of this vulnerability on more recent firmware versions (e.g.,
latest versions of the Samsung S4 and Samsung S6 software) is not so
straightforward: in the default configuration, when the device is connected
it exposes to the host only a MTP interface, used for file transfer.

However, we discovered that an attacker can still access the modem by switching
to secondary
[USB configuration](http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb5.shtml). As an
example, consider our test Galaxy S6 device. When USB debugging is off, the
device exposes two USB configurations, with the CDC ACM modem accessible via
configuration number 2.

	...

```

Thus, before being able to connect to the modem the attacker has to switch the
device to USB configuration number 2. This operation can be performed by the
host PC without the need to unlock the device.

For our PoC we developed a very rough C tool, [`usbswitcher`](/ud2/advisories/blob/master/android/samsung/nocve-2016-0004/usbswitcher.c),
that switches any attached Samsung device to USB configuration #2 (this is fine
for the devices we tested, but your mileage might vary). The tool uses
[libusb](http://libusb.org/) to do the job, but the same task can probably
be accomplished using the `/sys/bus/usb` pseudo-filesystem.

The trick we used to force the phone to switch the configuration is to first
reset the USB device (via `usb_reset()`), and then switching the configuration
(via `usb_set_configuration()`). Sometimes it doesn't work at the first try, so
just run `usbswitcher` twice to ensure the configuration is switched properly
:-)

## Possible consequences

The most obvious consequence of accessing the modem is the possibility to place
phone calls and send SMS messages. For the former, the following AT command can
be used:

```
ATD+123456;

```

This command starts a phone call to destination `+123456`, even when the device
is locked. This is the very same command we issued for the
[demo video we tweeted](https://twitter.com/rpaleari/status/674983960162787328).

As a response to our tweet, people asked if this vulnerability can be also
exploited to gain access to the device, e.g., to access the phonebook, photos,
and the internal storage. Well, theoretically AT commands should be directly processed by the
baseband processor, which normally should not be able to access the "Android
world". However, as we mentioned before, the journey of an AT command is more
convoluted and some AT commands are eventually interpreted by user-space
applications, so things may be different than what expected.

As an example, during our tests we observed that the S4 mini (build
I9192XXUBNB1) supports several AT commands that could be abused to control some
Android settings. Among these, `AT+USBDEBUG` command permits to enable "USB
debugging" (i.e., ADB), `AT+WIFIVALUE` enables and disables the Wi-Fi, and so
on.

On more recent phones and firmware versions, Samsung probably became aware of
the risks related to such commands and introduced a blacklist-based
mechanism (enforced by the `ddexe` binary application) to filter out dangerous
ones. As an example, issuing an `AT+USBDEBUG` on the Galaxy S6 results in the
following messages to be recorded to the system log:

```
D/DataRouter(  302): write [151] bytes of data to USB fd[9]
D/DataRouter(  302): After the usb select
D/DataRouter(  302): read usb data[len:12]
D/DataRouter(  302): read usb data message:AT+USBDEBUG
D/DataRouter(  302): Not allowed AT cmd!!
D/DataRouter(  302): Before the usb select

```
