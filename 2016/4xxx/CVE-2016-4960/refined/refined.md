Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `NVStreamKMS.sys` service component of NVIDIA's Windows graphics drivers.
*   The root cause is improper validation of user-supplied data through the service's API entry points.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient input validation:** The service fails to properly validate user-supplied data, allowing for potentially malicious input to be processed.
*   **API vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the service's API entry points, meaning it's exploitable through interactions with those APIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. This could allow an attacker to perform actions they would not otherwise be authorized to do, potentially including taking complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via local access, as indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:L` (Local access).
*   **API interaction:** The attack vector involves interacting with the vulnerable API entry points of the `NVStreamKMS.sys` service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Privileged access:** Although not stated in the description, the CVSS vector mentions `Au:S` (Authentication: Single), implying that the attacker needs to have some level of access before they can elevate privileges.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing the specific vulnerable component and cause.
*   The description explicitly states that the `NVStreamKMS.sys` component is improperly validating data, making it the central weak point.
