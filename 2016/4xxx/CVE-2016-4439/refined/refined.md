Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4439:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing input length validation check when writing to the command buffer of the ESP/NCR53C9x Fast SCSI controller emulation within QEMU. This controller utilizes a 16-byte FIFO buffer for command and data transfer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The lack of proper input length validation allows a write operation to exceed the bounds of the 16-byte command buffer (`s->cmdbuf`), leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged user within a guest QEMU environment can exploit the vulnerability to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  There is a potential for a privileged guest user to leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a privileged user within a QEMU guest operating system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to interact with the emulated ESP/NCR53C9x Fast SCSI controller from within the guest OS. They require the privileges to perform the SCSI command operations that trigger the out of bounds write.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `esp_reg_write()` function within the `hw/scsi/esp.c` file of QEMU.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the command length `s->cmdlen` is less than the buffer size `TI_BUFSZ` before writing to `s->cmdbuf`.
- The fix was introduced in the upstream commit: `<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-05/msg03273.html>`.

This vulnerability is present in QEMU versions prior to 2.7.0-r3 (Gentoo).
It affects multiple Ubuntu releases including 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04.
The vulnerability is described as "remote exploitable" in one of the provided documents but the attack vector requires a privileged user inside the guest which is not exactly a remote exploit, this might be a mischaracterization.
