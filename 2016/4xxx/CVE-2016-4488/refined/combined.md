| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c0)  Marcel Böhme    2016-03-31 14:40:56 UTC  ``` In the most recent version, Valgrind reports an invalid write of size 8 due to a use-after-free if the demangler is called with a certain class signature. However, the demangling succeeds in earlier versions.  How to Reproduce: binutils-2.26# valgrind binutils/cxxfilt _Q10-__9cafebabe. ==56086== Memcheck, a memory error detector ==56086== Copyright (C) 2002-2013, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al. ==56086== Using Valgrind-3.10.1 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info ==56086== Command: binutils/cxxfilt _Q10-__9cafebabe. ==56086==  ==56086== Invalid write of size 8 ==56086==    at 0x787D9B: remember_Ktype (cplus-dem.c:4300) ==56086==    by 0x787D9B: demangle_class (cplus-dem.c:2621) ==56086==    by 0x787D9B: demangle_signature (cplus-dem.c:1494) ==56086==    by 0x78DEA9: internal_cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:1204) ==56086==    by 0x75DC6A: cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:887) ==56086==    by 0x4063E1: demangle_it (cxxfilt.c:62) ==56086==    by 0x4059BE: main (cxxfilt.c:227) ..  The root cause: There is a variable ksize storing the amount of allocated memory for the array. ksize being zero (0) indicates that some memory must be allocated upon the first write. When more memory is needed, both ksize and the memory are doubled during reallocation. At some point the memory for the array is freed but the value of ksize remains. Since ksize is not 0, there is no indication that new memory must be allocated when there is another write to the array.  The solution: When freeing the memory of the array set ksize=0.  I am preparing a patch. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c1)  Mikhail Maltsev    2016-03-31 15:02:11 UTC  ``` Likely a dup of [PR67394](show_bug.cgi?id=67394 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - crash due to null pointer deref in demangle_signature()") ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c2)  Marcel Böhme    2016-03-31 15:36:04 UTC  ``` These are two distinct bugs. During fuzzing the btypevec bug appears more often. But it seemed less critical since only NULL is written to the freed memory: work -> btypevec[ret] = NULL;  On the other hand, the ktypevec bug allows to write arbitrary content to the freed memory: work -> ktypevec[work -> numk++] = tem; where tem is "cafebabe."  I used a more efficient version of the AFL fuzzer. Interestingly, I submitted the same patch: <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-03/msg01687.html> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c3)  Jeffrey A. Law    2016-03-31 17:24:28 UTC  ``` Fixed on the trunk. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c4)  Jeffrey A. Law    2016-03-31 17:25:13 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 67394](show_bug.cgi?id=67394 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - crash due to null pointer deref in demangle_signature()") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c5)  Jakub Jelinek    2016-05-19 10:45:04 UTC  ``` Author: jakub Date: Thu May 19 10:44:31 2016 New Revision: 236452  URL: <https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?rev=236452&root=gcc&view=rev> Log: 	Backported from mainline 	2016-05-19  Jakub Jelinek  <jakub@redhat.com>  	[PR c++/70498](show_bug.cgi?id=70498 "RESOLVED FIXED - Libiberty Demangler segfaults (3)") 	* cp-demangle.c (d_expression_1): Formatting fix.  	2016-05-02  Marcel Böhme  <boehme.marcel@gmail.com>  	[PR c++/70498](show_bug.cgi?id=70498 "RESOLVED FIXED - Libiberty Demangler segfaults (3)") 	* cp-demangle.c: Parse numbers as integer instead of long to avoid 	overflow after sanity checks.

Hash: SHA256

> 1) Exploitable Buffer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

As far as we can tell, you sent a CVE request for this vulnerability
to cve-assign@...re.org (from a different email address of yours) on
2016-02-05, and we replied with a CVE ID on 2016-02-06. Is there an
additional aspect of 69687 that you are reporting now?

Our reply at that time was:

  > <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

  >> Since n is a signed int, n wraps over at some iteration. Since,
  >> realloc expects n to be unsigned, we end up allocating less memory
  >> then actually needed. In the beginning though n is too large and
  >> xrealloc simply complains. However, if you play a bit with the length
  >> of arg, you'll quickly turn that integer overflow in a buffer
  >> overflow.

  Use CVE-2016-2226 for this incorrect handling of a signed int.

> 2) Invalid Write due to a Use-After-Free (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70481>

Comment 2 says "two distinct bugs."

Use CVE-2016-4487 for the btypevec bug.

Use CVE-2016-4488 for the ktypevec bug.

> 3) Invalid Write due to Integer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70492>

Use CVE-2016-4489.

> 4) Write Access Violation (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70498>

Use CVE-2016-4490 for this issue described as "Root cause: In
cp-demangle.c sometimes length-variables are of type long ... Other
times they are of type int."

Note that this CVE ID is not about the Comment 1 "case where
consume_count returns -1" -- that comment does not belong in 70498 at
all.

> 5) Various Stack Corruptions (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70909>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00105>

Use CVE-2016-4491 for this issue caused by a lack of checking for "has
itself as ancestor more than once."

> 6) Write Access Violation (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70926>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00223>

Use CVE-2016-4492 for both of the "first read the value of a length
variable len from the mangled string, then strncpy len characters from
the mangled string; more than necessary" issues.

Use CVE-2016-4493 for both of the "read the value of an array index n
from the mangled string, which can be negative due to an overflow"
issues.
