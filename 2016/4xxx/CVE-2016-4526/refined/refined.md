- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An error in the installation script of the ABB DataManagerPro application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installation script allows a local user to elevate their permissions to Administrator by swapping DLL files within a package when an administrative user logs in. This is due to insufficient checks during the installation process when the software runs as an administrator.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could insert and run arbitrary code on the affected system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, including data theft, denial of service, or further lateral movement.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with standard user privileges can exploit this vulnerability. The attack involves placing malicious DLLs in a specific directory within the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system where DataManagerPro is installed. They must have the ability to write files to a specific directory and be able to trick an administrator into logging into the affected system.
