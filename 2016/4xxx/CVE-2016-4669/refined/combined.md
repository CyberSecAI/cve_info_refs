# Apple OS X/iOS - 'mach\_ports\_register' Multiple Memory Safety s

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=882

mach_ports_register is a kernel task port MIG method.

It's defined in MIG like this:

  routine mach_ports_register(
      target_task : task_t;
      init_port_set : mach_port_array_t =
            ^array[] of mach_port_t);

Looking at the generated code for this we notice something kinda weird; here's the mach message structure
which actually gets sent:

  typedef struct {
    mach_msg_header_t Head;
    // start of the kernel processed data
    mach_msg_body_t msgh_body;
    mach_msg_ool_ports_descriptor_t init_port_set;
    // end of the kernel processed data
    NDR_record_t NDR;
    mach_msg_type_number_t init_port_setCnt;
  } Request __attribute__((unused));

The message contains an OOL ports descriptor, which is expected, but also contains a separate init_port_setCnt value
even though the ool_ports_descriptor_t already has the correct length of the descriptor.

When the kernel process this ool ports descriptor in ipc_kmsg_copyin_ool_ports_descriptor it will kalloc a buffer large enough
for all the ports and then copyin and convert them all. It does this using the init_port_set.count value, not init_port_setCnt.

The generated MIG code however calls mach_ports_register like this:

  OutP->RetCode = mach_ports_register(target_task, (mach_port_array_t)(In0P->init_port_set.address), In0P->init_port_setCnt);

without verifying that In0P->init_port_setCnt is equal to init_port_set.count.

This means that when we reach mach_ports_register lots of stuff goes wrong:

  kern_return_t
  mach_ports_register(
    task_t      task,
    mach_port_array_t memory,                       <-- points to kalloc'ed buffer
    mach_msg_type_number_t  portsCnt)               <-- completely controlled, not related to size of kalloc'ed buffer
  {
    ipc_port_t ports[TASK_PORT_REGISTER_MAX];
    unsigned int i;

    if ((task == TASK_NULL) ||
        (portsCnt > TASK_PORT_REGISTER_MAX) ||
        (portsCnt && memory == NULL))
      return KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT;                 <-- portsCnt must be >=1 && <= 3

    for (i = 0; i < portsCnt; i++)
      ports[i] = memory[i];                         <-- if we only sent one OOL port but set portsCnt >1 this will read a mach_port_t (a pointer) out of bounds
    for (; i < TASK_PORT_REGISTER_MAX; i++)
      ports[i] = IP_NULL;

    itk_lock(task);
    if (task->itk_self == IP_NULL) {
      itk_unlock(task);
      return KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < TASK_PORT_REGISTER_MAX; i++) {
      ipc_port_t old;

      old = task->itk_registered[i];
      task->itk_registered[i] = ports[i];
      ports[i] = old;
    }

    itk_unlock(task);

    for (i = 0; i < TASK_PORT_REGISTER_MAX; i++)
      if (IP_VALID(ports[i]))
        ipc_port_release_send(ports[i]);           <-- this can decrement the ref on a pointer which was read out of bounds if we call this function multiple times

    if (portsCnt != 0)
      kfree(memory,
            (vm_size_t) (portsCnt * sizeof(mach_port_t)));   <-- this can call kfree with the wrong size

    return KERN_SUCCESS;
  }

For this PoC I've patched the MIG generated code to always only send one OOL mach port but still set init_port_setCnt to a controlled value - you should see a kernel
panic decrementing an invalid reference or something like that.

This bug however could be exploited quite nicely to cause a mach_port_t UaF which could have all kinds of fun consequences (getting another task's task port for example!)

tested on OS X 10.11.6 (15G31) on MacBookPro10,1

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
