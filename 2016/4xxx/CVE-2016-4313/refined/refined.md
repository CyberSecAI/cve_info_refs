Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-4313

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the eXtplorer's archive (zip) extraction functionality. The software does not properly sanitize filenames within the archive, allowing path traversal through the use of `../` sequences in filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is the ability to specify relative paths like `../` within a ZIP archive, allowing files to be extracted to locations outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Overwriting:** An attacker can overwrite existing files, potentially including critical system or application configuration files (e.g. `.htaccess`).
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overwriting a file with malicious code, or placing a PHP backdoor (RCE.php), an attacker can achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by creating a specially crafted ZIP archive containing files with path traversal sequences in their names.
- This malicious archive is then uploaded and extracted using eXtplorer's built in functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the eXtplorer instance and have access to the file extraction functionality.
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious zip archive.
- The provided script allows for the attacker to define how many directory levels to move up.
- The CVSS score indicates the following:
    - **AV:L:** Local attack vector is required.
    - **AC:L:** Low attack complexity.
    - **PR:H:** High privileges are required.
    - **UI:R:** User interaction is required (to upload the archive and extract it).
    - **S:C:** Scope Changed.
    - **C:H:** High impact to confidentiality.
    - **I:L:** Low impact to Integrity.
    - **A:N:** No impact to availability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit has been tested on Windows.
- The provided PHP script `evil-archive.php` can be used to generate a malicious zip file.
