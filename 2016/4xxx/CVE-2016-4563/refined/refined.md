Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4563:

**Verification:**

The Oracle Security Bulletin directly mentions CVE-2016-4563 as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities fixed in ImageMagick within the Oracle Solaris distribution. This confirms the relevance of the provided content to the CVE. The commit log from the ImageMagick repository also confirms a fix for a buffer overflow issue, that is likely to be the root cause for this CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `DrawStrokePolygon()` function within the `draw.c` file of ImageMagick. This is caused by insufficient bounds checking in the `TraceStrokePolygon` function that calculates the number of strokes and allocates memory.

*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation on the input parameters when processing polygon drawing commands, leading to a potential buffer overflow during memory allocation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could result in arbitrary code execution. Specifically, the overflow in `DrawStrokePolygon` can overwrite memory, potentially allowing an attacker to control program execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through processing a crafted image file with a malicious polygon drawing command.
    *   This attack is exploitable remotely without authentication.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted image file to an application using the vulnerable ImageMagick library.
    *   No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned in the provided sources other than this.

**Technical Details:**

*   The commit `726812fa2fa7ce16bcf58f6e115f65427a1c0950` on the ImageMagick GitHub repository fixes the buffer overflow by adding a check to see if the strokes exceed the allowed maximum in function `TraceStrokePolygon`.
*   The changes include modification to `MagickCore/draw.c` file.
*   The vulnerability resides in a memory allocation routine within the `TraceStrokePolygon` function, called by `DrawStrokePolygon`, where memory is reallocated if needed, but a check was missing to prevent excessive reallocation leading to an integer overflow.
*  The fix limits the number of strokes that are processed to prevent the overflow in the `TraceStrokePolygon` function.
*   The `ChangeLog` entry notes: "Check for buffer overflow in magick/draw.c/DrawStrokePolygon()".

**Affected Versions:**

*  Oracle Solaris 11.3 and 10.
*   ImageMagick versions prior to the commit `726812fa2fa7ce16bcf58f6e115f65427a1c0950`.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-4563 is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in ImageMagick's `DrawStrokePolygon` function, that could allow for arbitrary code execution.
The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file, and was fixed in the commit `726812fa2fa7ce16bcf58f6e115f65427a1c0950`.
