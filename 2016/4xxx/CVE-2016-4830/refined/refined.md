Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Sushiro App fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The primary vulnerability is the lack of SSL server certificate validation. This means the app does not check if the certificate presented by the server is valid, trusted, or matches the expected server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned in the network path (e.g., through a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot) can intercept the encrypted communication between the app and the server.
- **Eavesdropping:** The attacker can decrypt and read the data being exchanged, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Data Manipulation:** In addition to eavesdropping, a MitM attacker could potentially modify the data being transmitted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is executed over a network, primarily through MitM.
- **Malicious Wireless Access Point:** The provided analysis assumes an attacker setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point to perform the MitM attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Positioning:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the user's device and the Sushiro servers. This could be achieved by:
    - Setting up a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.
    - Compromising a router or network device.
- **Ability to Intercept and Modify Traffic:** The attacker must be able to intercept and decrypt the network traffic, also having the ability to modify traffic if desired.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both iOS and Android versions of the Sushiro app, specifically versions 2.1.16 and earlier for iOS and 2.1.16.1 and earlier for Android.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity according to both CVSS v2 and v3.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yuta Teshima of Cyber Defense Institute, Inc.
