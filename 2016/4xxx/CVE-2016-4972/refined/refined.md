Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `YaqlYamlLoader` in OpenStack Murano and python-muranoclient inherited from `yaml.Loader` instead of `yaml.SafeLoader`. This allowed for the use of extended, unsafe YAML tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure YAML Deserialization:** The use of `yaml.Loader` permits the creation of arbitrary Python objects from specially crafted YAML tags. This is inherently unsafe because it allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By embedding malicious YAML tags within Murano application YAML files, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server processing the YAML.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Murano Application YAML Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when Murano processes YAML files, especially the UI definitions of a package, or within the python-muranoclient, when parsing YAML.
- Specifically, when using a yaql-enabled yaml loader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply or modify YAML files that are processed by a vulnerable Murano component (dashboard, engine/API) or by the python-muranoclient. This might involve being a Murano user, or having the ability to introduce files into a vulnerable Murano installation, or control over a client using the python-muranoclient.

**Affected Versions:**

- Murano: <=2015.1.1; <=1.0.2; ==2.0.0
- Murano-dashboard: <=2015.1.1; <=1.0.2; ==2.0.0
- Python-muranoclient: <=0.7.2; >=0.8.0<=0.8.4

**Mitigation:**

- The fix involves changing `YaqlYamlLoader` to inherit from `yaml.SafeLoader` and using `SafeConstructor` instead of `Constructor`. This prevents the creation of arbitrary Python objects from YAML files.
