Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the auto-update function of LINE for Windows. Specifically, the application fails to properly verify downloaded files during the update process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper verification of downloaded files. This implies a lack of integrity checks, such as verifying digital signatures or checksums, on the downloaded update files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned in the network path between the LINE client and the update server can intercept the update process.
- **Malicious File Download and Execution:** The attacker can replace the legitimate update file with a specially crafted malicious file. Since the application doesn't verify the downloaded file properly, it will proceed to execute the attacker's file.
- **Compromised System:** Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the affected system, as the attacker can execute arbitrary code. This could lead to data theft, system corruption, or further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:**  The primary attack vector is a network-based man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the LINE client and the update server. This could be achieved by controlling a network access point (e.g., malicious Wi-Fi hotspot) or compromising a router.
- **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic, including the downloaded update files.
- **Malicious File Creation:**  The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a malicious executable file that can be run by the LINE application.
