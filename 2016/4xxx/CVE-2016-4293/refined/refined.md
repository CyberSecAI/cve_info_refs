The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for CVE-2016-4293.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when copying style names (Table and Pivot styles) from a Hangul Hcell document into a fixed-size buffer within the application's memory. The application trusts the lengths provided in the file without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The application copies a variable-length string into a fixed-size buffer on the heap without checking if the string's length exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the length of the style names read from the file, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large length.
- **Use of unsafe string copy:** The vulnerable code uses `wcscpy_s`, a function which is intended to prevent overflows but relies on a valid size parameter, which the application fails to provide correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The heap-based buffer overflow can overwrite memory on the heap, potentially including function pointers or other critical data structures. This allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.
- **Application Crash:** As demonstrated in the crash analysis, the overflow corrupts memory leading to an access violation and application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Document:** An attacker can craft a specially crafted Hangul Hcell (.cell) document containing an oversized table or pivot style name.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens the malicious document using the vulnerable Hangul Hcell application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create or modify a .cell file.
- The attacker must then entice a user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable version of Hancom Hangul Hcell.
