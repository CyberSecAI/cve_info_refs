Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of rate limiting for PIN authentication attempts within the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) functionality of the Corega CG-WLR300GNV series wireless LAN routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The primary weakness is the absence of a mechanism to limit or block repeated PIN authentication attempts. This allows for brute force attacks against the WPS PIN.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a brute-force attack to recover the WPS PIN.
- Once the PIN is recovered, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the wireless network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attack can be carried out by an attacker within wireless range of the affected router.
- The attacker needs to be within the range of the wireless network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the vulnerable router
- They do not need any prior authentication to the router

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Corega Inc's CG-WLR300GNV and CG-WLR300GNV-W wireless LAN routers.
- The provided CVSS scores indicate a medium (v3) and low (v2) severity of the vulnerability.
- The suggested solution to mitigate the vulnerability is to disable the WPS functionality on the affected devices.
