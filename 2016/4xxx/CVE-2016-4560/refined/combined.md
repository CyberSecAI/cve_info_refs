# Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in InstallAnywhere affects IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center (CVE-2016-4560)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

InstallAnywhere generates installation executables which are vulnerable to a DLL-planting that affects IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center on Windows platforms.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-4560](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4560) Flexera InstallAnywhere could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system, caused by an untrusted search path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a Trojan horse DLL in the current working directory of a setup-launcher executable file to gain elevated privileges on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 7.8

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113016> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

The following levels of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center are affected on the Windows platform:

* 6.3.0.0 through 6.3.5.x
* 6.2 and 6.1 all levels (these releases are EOS)

## Remediation/Fixes

This security exposure occurs only at installation time and does not affect already installed Administration Centers.

If you are not installing a fixed level of the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center (6.3.6), then the installation package is vulnerable to this security issue during installation and you must use the workaround provided below to prevent being exposed to the vulnerability.

| ***Tivoli Storage Manager Server Release*** | ***First  Fixing  VRM Level*** | ***Platform*** | ***Link to Fix / Fix Availability Target*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6.3 | 6.3.6 | Windows | ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/storage/tivoli-storage-management/maintenance/admincenter/v6r3/6.3.6.000/ |
| 6.2 and 6.1 | None | Windows | Upgrade to the fixed level (6.3.6) or use the workaround provided below. |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

This security exposure occurs only at installation time and does not affect already installed Administration Centers.

To prevent exposure to this security vulnerability, download and run the installation package from a clean directory using the following steps:

1. As an administrator, create a new secure directory. The directory must not exist before and only the administrator should have write permission to it.
2. Unzip or copy the files from your installation media into this new directory.
3. Run the installation exe from this directory to install the product. Proceed with the installation as normal.

If installation of an Administration Center package below the fixing level (6.3.6) or installation of a package for release 6.2 or below is required, then the above workaround should be used to avoid exposure to this vulnerability during the installation process. The workaround is not needed if the fixing level (6.3.6) or a higher level of the package is installed.
