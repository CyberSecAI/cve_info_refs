Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Flexera InstallAnywhere generates installation executables. These executables are susceptible to a DLL-planting attack due to an insecure search path. The setup-launcher executable searches for DLL files in its current working directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Untrusted Search Path:** The primary weakness is the use of an insecure DLL search path by the InstallAnywhere generated installers. The application looks for DLLs in the same directory it's executed from, instead of only looking in trusted system locations.

- **DLL Planting/Hijacking:** This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL (Trojan horse) in the same directory as the installer. When the installer runs, it loads and executes the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one, granting the attacker control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. This means they can execute code with administrative or system-level permissions which could result in full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the machine and the ability to create files in a directory where an installation executable will run.
- **Trojan Horse DLL:** The attacker needs to create and place a malicious DLL file with the same name as a DLL the installer is trying to load into the directory where the installer will be executed.
- **Execution of Vulnerable Installer:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable installer is executed in a directory containing the malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:**  The attacker requires local access to the Windows machine where the vulnerable installation will occur.
- **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or copy a malicious DLL file into the directory from which the vulnerable installer will be launched.
- **Understanding of Install Path**: The attacker needs some knowledge of the product installation path, as they must know the location the installer will be executed from.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists only during the installation process. Once the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center or Tivoli Monitoring for Tivoli Storage Manager is installed, it is not vulnerable to this issue.
- The provided fix (6.3.6) is specific to versions of the product. Older versions are vulnerable and require either an upgrade or the specified workaround.
- The workaround is to create a clean directory that only the administrator has write permissions to. The installation files should then be extracted to this clean directory and the installer must be run from that directory.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, especially by clarifying the specific method of exploitation (DLL planting),  the scope of the vulnerability (only at install time), and the required attacker setup and position.
