- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the Kaspersky Internet Security KLIF driver when handling the `NtAdjustTokenPrivileges` system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Integer overflow vulnerability due to improper handling of the `PrivilegeCount` field of the `TOKEN_PRIVILEGES` structure.
  - Insufficient validation of user-supplied data when allocating memory, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local denial of service (BSOD/system crash) due to the kernel driver accessing invalid memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted `NtAdjustTokenPrivileges` call from user mode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the local machine. No special privileges are explicitly required to trigger the vulnerability, however, the token being adjusted requires a process to hold it.
