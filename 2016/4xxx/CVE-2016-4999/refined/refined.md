Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Dashbuilder, specifically when handling SQL dataset lookup requests. The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided string filter parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization of string filter parameters used in SQL queries. The application was vulnerable to SQL injection via the Data Set Authoring UI or the Displayer editor UI
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly escape or sanitize single quotes (') or double quotes (") or backticks(`) within the string filter parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to bypass normal access controls and retrieve sensitive information from the database.
- Data Manipulation: An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
- Potential System Compromise: Depending on the database permissions, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, which could lead to system compromise in the worst case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- Crafted String Filter Parameter: The attack vector is a specially crafted string filter parameter submitted via the Data Set Authoring UI or the Displayer editor UI of Dashbuilder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Network Access: The attacker needs remote network access to the vulnerable Dashbuilder instance.
- Knowledge of API:  The attacker needs knowledge of the Dashbuilder API used for data set lookups.
- Ability to Craft SQL Injection Payload: The attacker needs the ability to craft SQL injection payloads by injecting malicious SQL into string filter parameters.
