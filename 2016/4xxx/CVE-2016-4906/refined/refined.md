- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the "Messages" function of Cybozu Garoon Keitai.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on a user's web browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the "Messages" function of the Cybozu Garoon Keitai interface. The attack vector is network-based and requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts within the "Messages" functionality, and a victim must interact with this injected content to trigger the vulnerability. The CVSS v3 vector string suggests that the attack complexity is high, the attacker does not require privileges, and the scope is changed.
