Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing a user with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary scripts into an administration page. These scripts are then stored and executed when other administrative users access the same page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The vulnerability allows the injection of malicious scripts that are stored within the application and later executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the administrative page. When another user with administrative privileges accesses that page, the script will execute in their browser.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the administrative interface, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker with administrative group privileges can inject the malicious script through a vulnerable input field within the administration interface of baserCMS.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when another user with administrative group privileges accesses the page containing the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker must be logged in to the baserCMS system with administrative privileges to inject the malicious script.
*   **Social Engineering:** No social engineering is required for the actual execution of the script, as it will automatically trigger once another user accesses the affected admin page.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-4880 is a stored XSS vulnerability in baserCMS. An attacker with administrative privileges can inject arbitrary scripts via a vulnerable input in the administration interface. When other administrative users view the injected content, the malicious script executes in their browser, leading to potential compromise of the administrative account.
