The provided content is related to CVE-2016-4573.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the implementation of a "rest_admin" account in FortiSwitch version 3.4.1 when managed by a FortiGate device. The password generation for this account depends on communication with the FortiGate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- If the FortiSwitch cannot establish a network connection with the FortiGate during the initial two reboots or if the FortiSwitch is downgraded to a version prior to 3.4.1, the "rest_admin" account is exposed with a null password.
- The "rest_admin" account has super_admin privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain full administrative control over the vulnerable FortiSwitch device by using the null password of the "rest_admin" account. This access could enable malicious activities on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through network access to the FortiSwitch device.
- The attack can be conducted after a reboot of the affected FortiSwitch or after a downgrade.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the FortiSwitch.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the FortiGate.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability.
