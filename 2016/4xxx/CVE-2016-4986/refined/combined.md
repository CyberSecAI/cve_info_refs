This plug-in reads a job workspace and collects images to produce an image gallery using [colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox) lightbox Javascript library.

## Description

This plug-in reads a job workspace and collects images to produce an image gallery using [colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox) lightbox Javascript library.

This plug-in was created to mimic the behaviour of [Bioportal](http://www.bioportal.uio.no/) (now [Lifeportal](https://lifeportal.uio.no/)) jobs that display images of submitted jobs. The development started in [BioUno](http://www.biouno.org/), a project that uses Jenkins for running bioinformatics tools and managing clusters.

## Gallery Types

### Archived images gallery

This gallery is created from archived images. It means that you have to use the post build step to archive artifacts and give the gallery a pattern that will match these files.

The images in the Screenshot section were taken from a gallery of this type.

### In folder comparative archived images gallery

This gallery is created from archived images. It means that you have to use the post build step to archive artifacts and give the gallery a pattern that will match these files.

This gallery is useful when your build generates images in multiple folder, but with a common base root dir. It receives a base root dir as parameter, and it must be relative to the workspace. Then it will create a navigation tree with the images per folder. The screen shot below should help to clarify the explanation. In the example below the directories 3 and 4 both had images, and a common ancestor directory, used as base root dir.

### Multiple folder comparative archived images gallery

This gallery is created from archived images. It means that you have to use the post build step to archive artifacts and give the gallery a pattern that will match these files.

It is similar to the previous gallery type, but each image will be an entry in the navigation tree. It means that if your directory has three pictures, each one will become an entry in the navigation tree. If you were using the in folder gallery, then you would have a gallery with three pictures. The screen shot below shows the difference between the multiple folder (top) and the in folder (bottom) galleries.

Note that by clicking structure01.png folder in the upper gallery, you would see the picture thumbnail. While, on the other hand, the other gallery displays the two pictures in a single category.

## Using environment variables in your gallery title

Since 1.1 you can use [Jenkins set environment variables](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Building%2Ba%2Bsoftware%2Bproject#Buildingasoftwareproject-JenkinsSetEnvironmentVariables) and other variables in your build in your gallery title.

## Overview

This plug-in adds support to [TAP](https://testanything.org/) test result files to Jenkins. It lets you specify an ant-like pattern for a directory that contains your TAP files and scans and creates views for your test results in Jenkins.

TAP Plug-in depends on [tap4j](https://github.com/tupilabs/tap4j) - a TAP implementation for Java, and on the [Jenkins JUnit Plug-in](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/).

> NOTE: You may get errors if the JUnit Plug-in is not active in your Jenkins instance (see JENKINS-27227 for more).

## Overview

The plug-in looks for TAP files like the following one.

```
1..2
ok 1 - Yahoo!
not ok 2 - org.tap4j.Error...

```

When a TAP stream like the above is found, the plug-in delegates the parsing the tap4j. The results of tap4j parsing are then analysed, organized and displayed to the user as graphs and custom pages.

You can test your TAP streams with tap4j, using [InstantTAP](http://instanttap.appspot.com/).

### Understanding TAP streams in 2 minutes

One of the easiest ways to learn something new is by examples. So here we will show some examples of TAP streams. For being human-friendly, it shouldn't confuse you. We will use comments to explain each line.

```
1..2 # a plan stating that we have two tests cases, from 1 to 2.
ok 1 - Yahoo! # the first test result was executed successfully and has a description of ' - Yahoo!'.
not ok 2 - org.tap4j.Error... # unfortunately, the second test result failed. The description here was used to display some nasty Exception.

```

### Running Perl tests with prove

The plug-in cannot handle prove's default output (since it includes more information than simply TAP, and causes tap4j parser to fail). The best way to handle the prove output is by using Perl module [TAP::Harness::Archive](http://search.cpan.org/~wonko/TAP-Harness-Archive-0.14/lib/TAP/Harness/Archive.pm). Supposing you have your tests under t/ directory, you can create another directory (say, output) and archive your TAP tests with prove by using a command line similar to the below:

```
prove t/ --archive output
```

The result files will be stored under *output/t/*. You can use a pattern in the plug-in configuration like *t/\*****/****.t*.

### Using attachments

The following is a TAP with attachments, using YAMLish. If you are familiar with YAML, this example should be very easy to read.

```
1..2
  ok 1
  not ok 2 - br.eti.kinoshita.selenium.TestListVeterinarians#testGoogle
  ---
extensions:
  Files:
    my_message.txt:
      File-Title: my_message.txt
      File-Description: Sample message
      File-Size: 31
      File-Name: message.txt
      File-Content: TuNvIGNvbnRhdmFtIGNvbSBtaW5oYSBhc3T6Y2lhIQ==
      File-Type: image/png
  ...
```

The Files entry has an array of files. You have to Base64 encode your content data.

### Subtests (grouping or test suites).

Subtests let you group several TAP streams unto a single one. This way, you can organize your tests in similar fashion to JUnit or TestNG test suites. Indentation is important for TAP subtests.

Subtests and YAMLish are not officially in TAP 13 specification

```
  1..3
  ok 1 - First test
  1..2
  ok 1 - This is a subtest
  ok 2 - So is this
  1..2
  ok 1 - This is a subtest
  ok 2 - So is this
  ok 2 - An example subtest
  ok 3 - Third test
```

## Configuration

1. Install the Jenkins TAP Plug-in using the Plug-in Manager or manually by copying the `.hpi` (or `.jpi`) file
2. Check the option to publish TAP, configure a pattern (and other settings)
3. Execute your build and analyze the results

## Languages Supported

1. English (American)
2. Portuguese (Brazil)) Work in Progress
3. Spanish (Thanks to César Fernandes de Almeida) Work in Progress

## Known Limitations

1. If the file type of the TAP report is considered as binary by the Jenkins webserver then the TAP plugin does not consider this file for inclusion in TAP reports (see [#15813](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15813) for further details). To make sure your TAP report is considered for inclusion use e.g. the file name suffix `.tap` ( so instead of a file named `report` use `report.tap`).

## Release Notes

Moved to [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/jenkinsci/tap-plugin/blob/master/./CHANGES.md).

## Roadmap (wish list)

### Version 2.x

1. Update Jenkins API
2. Update tap4j to match the latest protocol specification (13 and 14)
3. Remove deprecated code
4. Simplify code (it's old!)

### Version 1.x

1. Add configurations like validate number of tests with test plan, a TODO causes a test to fail
2. Diagnostics image gallery Done! Fixed as a [new plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Image%2BGallery%2BPlugin)
3. Diagnostics exception code formatting
4. Add a link to open the file in the Build workspace (think about remote and local issues) Done!

## History

The idea of the plug-in surged after tap4j was created. After learning about Smolder, it became evident that Jenkins could be used as a replacement for it. All that was needed was just adding TAP support to Jenkins and implementing a nice UI to display the test results. After some messages in jenkins-dev-list, Max and Nick commented about their need to show test results in a different manner than how Jenkins was doing at that moment. Soon after that Max, Nick, Bruno (tap4j) and Cesar (tap4j) started to work together, exchanging mail messages and discussing an initial design for this plug-in.

In July 2011 the first version of the plug-in was ready to be released. The graph code used here was adapted from TestNG Plugin (big thanks to the development team, great work). The diagnostic (YAMLish) was implemented in Jelly + Java + CSS. And the road map was incremented based on what Gábor Szabó posted about Smolder and testing reports in his blog (see resources for links).

## Simulating TAP streams with a Shell build step

You can use a [heredoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) to write a TAP file with Shell, and use it with the plug-in. This is useful for testing.

```
#!/bin/bash

for x in {1..100}; do

cat > $x.tap <<EOF
ok 1
not ok 2
ok 3 # SKIP
not ok 4
ok 5
ok 6
ok 7
EOF

done ;
```

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2016-06-20

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in these Jenkins plugins:

* [Async Http Client Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/async-http-client)
* [Build Failure Analyzer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-failure-analyzer)
* [Image Gallery Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/image-gallery)
* [TAP Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/tap)

## Description

### Path traversal vulnerability in TAP Plugin

**SECURITY-85 / CVE-2016-4986**

The plugin did not correctly filter a parameter and allowed reading arbitrary files on the file system.

### Path traversal vulnerability in Image Gallery Plugin

**SECURITY-278 / CVE-2016-4987**

The plugin did not correctly validate form fields and allowed listing arbitrary directories and reading arbitrary files on the file system.

### Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Build Failure Analyzer Plugin

**SECURITY-290 / CVE-2016-4988**

The plugin did not escape a parameter echoed on an HTML page, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.

### Async HTTP Client Plugin does not properly validate certificates

**SECURITY-305 / CVE-2013-7397 and CVE-2013-7398**

Async HTTP Client Plugin provides the Async HTTP Client Java library to other plugins. It is based on the 1.7.x line of AHC, which by default is vulnerable to [CVE-2013-7397](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7397) and [CVE-2013-7398](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7398), allowing man-in-the-middle attacks. The fixes for these vulnerabilities were backported. The system property `jenkins.plugins.asynchttpclient.AHC.acceptAnyCertificate` can temporarily be set to `true` to disable these new validity checks. [Learn more about system properties in Jenkins](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/).
