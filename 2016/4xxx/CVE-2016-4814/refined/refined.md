Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal issue present in the `kml2jsonp.php` file within the source code of Old_GSI_Maps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-22: Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to traverse directories on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can potentially obtain arbitrary files from the server where Old_GSI_Maps is running, especially when the product is deployed on Windows. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required. The attacker does not need user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
