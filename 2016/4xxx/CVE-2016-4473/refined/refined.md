{
  "CVE-2016-4473": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An invalid `free()` was used instead of `efree()` in the `phar_extract_file()` function of PHP's phar extension, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use of incorrect memory deallocation function (`free()` instead of `efree()`), leading to a double free or use-after-free",
      "Potential for arbitrary code execution if `cwd` (current working directory) is user-controlled"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a PHP application or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that PHP application.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By processing a specially crafted phar archive using `phar_extract_file()` function",
      "Exploiting a directory traversal vulnerability when extracting Zip-based Phar archives, which may then lead to code execution"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to upload a malicious phar archive to a PHP application where it will be processed by the vulnerable function."
  },
  "CVE-2016-5094": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the php_html_entities() function which can result in a large memory allocation",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflow allowing construction of strings with a length outside the integer range"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a PHP application by allocating large amount of memory",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a sufficiently large input that would cause the PHP internal function php_escape_html_entities_ex() to generate output of more than 2GB.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide large input into the vulnerable function, which may not be feasible due to PHP memory limits."
  },
   "CVE-2016-5399": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `bzread` function in PHP's bz2 extension is prone to an out-of-bounds write due to improper error handling in decompression.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
         "Improper error handling"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could use a crafted bz2 archive to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted bz2 archive to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable `bzread` function for decompression.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to supply a crafted bz2 archive to a php application, potentially through upload or other input means"
   },
    "CVE-2016-6128": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `gdImageCropThreshold` function in libgd does not properly handle an invalid color index leading to a crash.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper handling of an invalid color index leading to an out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a specially crafted image with an invalid color index.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted image to an application that makes use of the vulnerable gd library via the `gdImageCropThreshold` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to send or upload a specially crafted image to an application."
  },
    "CVE-2016-6161": {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds read in the `output` function of libgd when processing a crafted GIF image.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds read when encoding a GIF from a malformed input.",
      "Potential denial of service"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a crafted GIF image.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a malformed image to a PHP application making use of the libgd library, triggering the vulnerable function when encoding a GIF.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to send a crafted GIF image to a php application that makes use of libgd."
