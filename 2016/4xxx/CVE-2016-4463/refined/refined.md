Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-4463:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The Apache Xerces-C XML Parser fails to handle deeply nested DTD (Document Type Definition) structures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Stack overflow due to excessive recursion when processing deeply nested DTDs.
*   The nesting limit is implemented as a compile-time constant, which makes it difficult to modify without breaking ABI compatibility.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of service (DoS) against applications using the Xerces-C library. This could lead to application crashes and service unavailability, due to stack overflow.
*   An unauthenticated attacker can trigger this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Sending a specially crafted XML document containing a deeply nested DTD structure.
*   This attack vector is network-based which means that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send or provide a malicious XML document to an application using vulnerable versions of the Xerces-C library.
*   No authentication or specific privileges are required.
*   The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.

**Additional Information:**
*   Some vendors have also included a patch to disable DTD processing via an environment variable as an additional mitigation.
*   The issue was reported by Brandon Perry.
*   The fix involves implementing a nesting limit to avoid the stack overflow.
*   Some vendors have a severity rating of "moderate", however, the description from Apache indicates that the severity is "important".
*   Some CVSS v2 scores given by SUSE are AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P and SUSE labels it as 'moderate'.
*   CVSS v3 score of 7.5 with vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
*   Red Hat considers it a "moderate" impact.
*   The fix is available in Xerces-C++ 3.1.4.
