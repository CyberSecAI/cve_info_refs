{
  "CVE-2016-4457": {
    "Description": "CloudForms includes a default SSL/TLS certificate for the web server. This certificate is replaced at install time. However if an attacker were able to man-in-the-middle an administrator while installing the new certificate, the attacker could get a copy of the uploaded private key allowing for future attacks.",
    "Root cause": "The use of a default SSL/TLS certificate across all CloudForms installs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of a default SSL/TLS certificate",
      "Lack of proper protection during initial certificate replacement"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could obtain the private key through a man-in-the-middle attack during the initial certificate replacement process, allowing them to conduct future attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack during initial certificate replacement"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network during the installation of CloudForms and the upload of the new certificate."
