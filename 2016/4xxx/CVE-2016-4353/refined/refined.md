Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-4353:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a stack overflow in the `ber-decoder.c` file of the libksba library when decoding certain BER data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability due to insufficient error handling within the BER decoder.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service. An attacker can cause the application using the library to crash, disrupting service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing specially crafted BER data to the vulnerable function within `ber-decoder.c`, an attacker can trigger the stack overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send or supply the specially crafted BER data to an application or service utilizing the vulnerable libksba library. No special privileges or local access is required.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this issue was to improve the error handling mechanism within the BER decoder when a stack overflow occurs.
- This CVE is specifically related to the change of error handling after the overflow, and not the prevention of the stack overflow itself.
- The vulnerability primarily affects Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS.

The provided content indicates that CVE-2016-4353 is part of a group of vulnerabilities found in `libksba` and fixed in version 1.3.3 and higher.
