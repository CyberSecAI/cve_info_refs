Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-4000:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsafe deserialization of a crafted serialized PyFunction object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Arbitrary Code Execution
*   Deserialization of Untrusted Data

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Attackers can execute arbitrary code on systems running affected versions of Jython.
*   Total loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability as stated by CVSS 3.1 score.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network based - sending a crafted serialized function to the deserializer.
*   Remotely exploitable without authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to send a specially crafted serialized Python object to a vulnerable Jython deserializer.
*   No specific user interaction is needed.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is present in `org.python:jython-standalone` package.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed on 19 Jan 2016.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Jython version 2.7.1rc1.
*   Specific versions of `dev-java/jython` in SUSE and Ubuntu are affected and have been patched.
*   Multiple Oracle products were found to be vulnerable.
*   Several vendor security advisories mention the vulnerability.
*   The fix was implemented by not directly deserializing `PyFunction` objects.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')).
*   The CVSS score from snyk is 9.8 (Critical), with attack vector 'Network', low complexity, and no privileges or user interaction required. The scope is Unchanged, with High impacts on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
