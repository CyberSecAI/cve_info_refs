Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-4118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the installer of the Adobe Connect Add-In for Windows. Specifically, it's an "untrusted search path vulnerability". This means the installer is searching for required files in locations that are not secure or controlled by the software, such as user-writable directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Search Path:** The core issue is that the installer does not properly validate the locations from which it loads libraries or other executable components. It can be tricked into loading malicious code by placing it in a directory searched by the installer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves placing a malicious file (likely a DLL or similar) in a location that the vulnerable installer searches during its execution. When the installer attempts to load a legitimate file from the compromised search path, it instead loads and executes the attacker's malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write files to a location that is included in the installer's search path. This could involve exploiting other vulnerabilities or leveraging user-writable locations. The attacker also needs the capability to craft a malicious file that will be executed by the installer.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Connect Add-In versions 11.9.975.228 and earlier on the Windows platform.
- The issue was reported by Anand Bhat.
- The fix is available in version 11.9.976.291 of the Add-In.
- For Hosted Connect customers, the issue is automatically resolved when the account is upgraded to Connect 9.5.3.
