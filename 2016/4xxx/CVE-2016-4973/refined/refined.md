Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how GCC's `libssp` (library for Stack Smashing Protection) is implemented for certain targets. Specifically, targets that rely on `libssp` for SSP (like Cygwin, MinGW, newlib, RTEMS) were not properly utilizing the `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` functionality, which provides object size checking. This is because the required headers were not correctly installed by the compiler, leading to the fortify checks not being performed at compile time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Object Size Checking:**  When `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` is used, the compiler should replace standard functions like `strcpy` with their safer, `_chk` counterparts (e.g. `__strcpy_chk`). These checked versions perform additional bounds checks at runtime to prevent buffer overflows. Due to the improper header installation for non-glibc based targets, this replacement doesn't happen, effectively disabling the protection.
- **Incorrect Header Installation:** The `libssp` headers were installed in a subdirectory, which prevented the compiler from finding them when `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` was specified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Increased Buffer Overflow Risk:** Binaries compiled for affected targets, even when the developer used `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, lack crucial object size checking. This makes them more susceptible to buffer overflow attacks, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
- **Bypassed Security Mitigation:** The intended protection mechanism is completely bypassed, leaving a security gap despite attempts to enable it during compilation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Buffer Overflow Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a binary compiled with a vulnerable version of GCC targeting systems that rely on `libssp` for SSP.  The absence of fortify checks would make the overflow easier to achieve without causing a crash from the built-in checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Trigger a Buffer Overflow:** The attacker needs to be able to cause a buffer overflow in a vulnerable application compiled with the affected GCC versions and target architecture.
- **Knowledge of the Target System:** The attacker benefits from understanding that the target is using one of the affected platforms that use libssp for SSP and relies on `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` for object size checking.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability does not affect systems that have SSP implemented in their libc (e.g., Glibc, Bionic, NetBSD).
- The issue is specifically related to the combination of `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` and targets relying on `libssp` for SSP.
- Patches were proposed, and the root cause was header installation misconfiguration combined with missing linking of lib-ssp when `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` is enabled.
- The issue was resolved upstream by adding proper support for object size checking in the affected libcs.
