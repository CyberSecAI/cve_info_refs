Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-4878:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can force a logged-in administrative user to perform unintended operations within the baserCMS application. This could lead to:
    *   Unauthorized changes to the system
    *   Potentially, further compromise of the server depending on the forged actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack requires luring a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious URL crafted by the attacker.
*   The attacker needs no prior authentication or access to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious URL and have the ability to trick a logged-in administrative user into visiting it.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that CVE-2016-4878 is related to the core baserCMS system, not a specific plugin.
*   The same vulnerability type (CSRF) and exploitation method are also used for several other CVEs listed in the document (CVE-2016-4879, CVE-2016-4881, CVE-2016-4884, CVE-2016-4885, CVE-2016-4886, and CVE-2016-4887).
