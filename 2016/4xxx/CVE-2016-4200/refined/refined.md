Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4200:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the handling of XPath expressions within Adobe Reader DC. Specifically, a "copy-of" element in a PDF document combined with a specially crafted XPath expression can cause the software to write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The core issue is that the application writes data past the boundaries of a designated memory region.
- Memory corruption: The out-of-bounds write leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running Adobe Reader DC).
- Control of the affected system: An attacker could potentially gain control of the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF document: The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted PDF document that contains the vulnerable "copy-of" element and XPath expression.
- User interaction is required: The victim needs to open the malicious PDF document to trigger the vulnerability. This can be done by opening the file locally or visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the opening of the document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious PDF documents.
- Ability to deliver the malicious PDF to the victim (e.g., via email, website).

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and Adobe Acrobat DC.
- This vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
