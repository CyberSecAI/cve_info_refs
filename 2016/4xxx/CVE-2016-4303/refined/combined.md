# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0164

## ESnet iPerf3 JSON parse\_string UTF Code Execution Vulnerability

##### June 8, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-4303

### DESCRIPTION

An exploitable remote code execution vulnerability exists in the JSON handling functionality of ESnet iPerf3. A specially crafted JSON string can lead to buffer overflow on the heap resulting in remote code execution. An attacker can send an unauthenticated packet to any reachable iPerf3 server to trigger this vulnerability.

Note a list of iPerf3 servers are listed here that are currently vulnerable to this attack https://iperf.fr/iperf-servers.php

### TESTED VERSIONS

iperf 3.1.1

### DETAILS

ESnet iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers. For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters.

The vulnerability centers around the mishandling of UTF8/16 strings within cjson.c. When attempting to allocate room for the resulting cstring, a logic error occurs when sscanf reaches a non-hex character (‘”’), however the pointer is incremented by 4 bytes regardless of the result. This skips the quote character causing the while loop to miss the first quote and continue writing until the second quote is found.

This results in an overflow into the next heap structure, clobbering the heap block header. The “key” found in this JSON string does not match any known keys and is later freed. I have commented some of the lines below:

```
236 static const char *parse_string( cJSON *item, const char *str )
237 {
[...snip...]
250     /* Skip escaped quotes. */
251     while ( *ptr != '\"' && *ptr && ++len ) // extract key from 'ptr'
252         if ( *ptr++ == '\\' )
253             ptr++;
254
255     if ( ! ( out = (char*) cJSON_malloc( len + 1 ) ) ) // Malloc Block Size of 0x3 (actually              reserves 0x20 bytes)
256         return 0;
257
258     ptr = str + 1;  // move ptr past the first quote of the key ("\uC" in this case)
259     ptr2 = out;     // ptr2 will store the resulting cstring
260     while ( *ptr != '\"' && *ptr ) { // until the second quote or backslash is found
261         if ( *ptr != '\\' )         // the slash in \uC is found
262             *ptr2++ = *ptr++;       // ptr2 will store the unescaped contents of ptr overflowing the      block allocated for only 3 bytes
263         else {
264             ptr++;                  // skip the slash found and check the escaped char
265             switch ( *ptr ) {
266                 case 'b': *ptr2++ ='\b'; break;
267                 case 'f': *ptr2++ ='\f'; break;
268                 case 'n': *ptr2++ ='\n'; break;
269                 case 'r': *ptr2++ ='\r'; break;
270                 case 't': *ptr2++ ='\t'; break;
271                 case 'u':                       // UTF8/16 found
272                     /* Transcode utf16 to utf8. */
273                     /* Get the unicode char. */
274                     sscanf( ptr + 1,"%4x", &uc ); // sscanf stops at non-hex char '"'
275                     ptr += 4;                     // ptr inc'd by 4 regardless of sscanf result
													  // making ptr point out of bounds of the buffer
[...snip...]
302                     switch ( len ) {
[...snip...]
306                         case 1: *--ptr2 = ( uc | firstByteMark[len] );
307                     }
308                     ptr2 += len;
309                     break;
310                 default:  *ptr2++ = *ptr; break;
311             }
312             ++ptr;
313         }
314     }
315     *ptr2 = 0;      // terminate cstring
316     if ( *ptr == '\"' )
317         ++ptr;
318     item->valuestring = out; // item is a cJSON struct
319     item->type = cJSON_String;
320     return ptr;
321 }

```

This object is then compared against a list of keys, the JSON object is deleted and the string is freed.

```
perf_api.c
1336 static int
1337 get_parameters(struct iperf_test *test)
1338 {
1339     int r = 0;
1340     cJSON *j;
1341     cJSON *j_p;
1342
1343     j = JSON_read(test->ctrl_sck);
1344     if (j == NULL) {
1345     i_errno = IERECVPARAMS;
1346         r = -1;
1347     } else {
1348     if (test->debug) {
1349         printf("get_parameters:\n%s\n", cJSON_Print(j));
1350     }
1351
1352     if ((j_p = cJSON_GetObjectItem(j, "tcp")) != NULL)
1353         set_protocol(test, Ptcp);
1354     if ((j_p = cJSON_GetObjectItem(j, "udp")) != NULL)
1355         set_protocol(test, Pudp);
[...snip...]
1392     if ((j_p = cJSON_GetObjectItem(j, "get_server_output")) != NULL)
1393         iperf_set_test_get_server_output(test, 1);
1394     if ((j_p = cJSON_GetObjectItem(j, "udp_counters_64bit")) != NULL)
1395         iperf_set_test_udp_counters_64bit(test, 1);
1396     if (test->sender && test->protocol->id == Ptcp && has_tcpinfo_retransmits())
1397         test->sender_has_retransmits = 1;
1398     cJSON_Delete(j); // delete the object
1399     }
1400     return r;
1401 }

```

When attempting to delete the object cJSON->valuestring, the corrupted chunk is read in and then freed:

```
3833    static void
3834    _int_free (mstate av, mchunkptr p, int have_lock)

3844
3845   const char *errstr = NULL;
3846   int locked = 0;
3847
3848   size = chunksize (p);
[...]
3960     nextchunk = chunk_at_offset(p, size);

__GI___libc_free (malloc.c:3848)
3848   size = chunksize (p);

>>> p/x size

Based on a patch by [@dopheide-esnet](https://github.com/dopheide-esnet), with input from [@DaveGamble](https://github.com/DaveGamble).

malformed JSON string was passed on the control channel.  This issue,

Based on a patch by [@dopheide-esnet](https://github.com/dopheide-esnet), with input from [@DaveGamble](https://github.com/DaveGamble).

# Vulnerability Spotlight: ESnet iPerf3 JSON parse\_string UTF Code Execution Vulnerability

By
[Edmund Brumaghin](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/author/edmund-brumaghin/)

Wednesday, June 8, 2016 16:07

[Vulnerability Spotlight](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/vulnerability-spotlight/)

This vulnerability was discovered by Dave McDaniel, Senior Research Engineer.

## Summary

iPerf is a network testing application that is typically deployed in a client/server configuration and is used to measure the available network bandwidth between the systems by creating TCP and/or UDP connections. For each connection, iPerf reports maximum bandwidth, loss, and other performance related metrics. It is commonly used to evaluate and quantify the impact of network optimizations and for obtaining baseline metrics related to network performance.

iPerf3, developed by ESnet and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is a complete redesign of the original iPerf application and uses a forked cJSON library. Cisco Talos recently discovered that the forked version of the cJSON library contains a vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on systems running the iPerf3 server daemon. This vulnerability is related to the way in which the forked cJSON library parses UTF-8/16 strings. There are currently several public iPerf3 servers that are accessible from the internet that may be susceptible to remote exploitation using this vulnerability. While the authors of the underlying cJSON library have since released a patch that resolves this vulnerability, the version of cJSON shipped with iPerf3 3.1-1 is vulnerable. The updated version of the iPerf3 application can be obtained [here](http://software.es.net/iperf/news.html#security-issue-iperf-3-1-3-iperf-3-0-12-released).

## Details

When dealing with Unicode strings, the JSON specification calls for the the use of the ‘\u’ token, followed by four hexadecimal digits. The vulnerability in iPerf3 lies within the included cJSON library and is due to the way in which the parse\_string() function handles memory allocation when dealing with UTF-8/16 strings. When a UTF-8/16 string is received, this function attempts to evaluate the string to determine proper heap allocation based upon the size of the input received.

When a UTF-8/16 string containing the ‘ “ ‘ character is encountered, the sscanf() function attempts to read the string. Due to the format requested, sscanf() will stop reading the string once it encounters the first ‘ “ ‘ however the buffer pointer is automatically incremented by four bytes regardless of the actual length of the string provided. This creates a logic error and causes the continued writing to the reserved block until the end of the loop is reached. By providing a long enough string, an attacker can create a heap overflow condition and cause an overwrite of the heap block headers. This could also potentially lead to remote code execution.

The object is later compared against a list of keys, which it does not match and is deleted, freeing the string. When attempting to delete the object, the corrupted chunk of memory is read then subsequently freed.

The application then attempts to consolidate backwards, encountering the previously corrupted heap block headers, which causes the application to crash.

## Tested Versions

The following versions were tested by Talos:

iperf 3.1.1 2015-10-16

iperf3 3.1-1 2015-11-02

## Conclusion

The official cJSON library was previously updated to resolve this vulnerability. Users of the cJSON library can obtain the latest version available from the official cJSON Github repository as it contains several fixes related to security vulnerabilities that have been discovered in cJSON. Users of the iPerf3 application should update to the latest version of iPerf3 as quickly as possible to resolve this vulnerability.

TALOS-2016-0164 is detected by SID 39165.

## Description

The parse\_string function in cjson.c in the cJSON library mishandles UTF8/16 strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a non-hex character in a JSON string, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

These releases address a security issue that could cause a crash of an
iperf3 process (it could theoretically lead to a remote code
execution). Although the risk for common use cases is believed to be
low, all users are encouraged to update to these versions or newer as
soon as possible. More information on the security vulnerability can
be found in the following ESnet Software Security Advisory:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esnet/security/master/cve-2016-4303/esnet-secadv-2016-0001.txt.asc>

This release fixes a few minor bugs.

### 2015-10-16: iperf3 Development Status[¶](#iperf3-development-status "Link to this heading")

Beginning with the release of iperf 3.1, ESnet plans to support iperf3
in “maintenance mode”. At this point, we have no definite plans for
further iperf3 releases, and ESnet will be providing a very limited
amount of resources for support and development, going forward.
However, ESnet could issue new iperf3 releases to deal with security
issues or high-impact bug fixes.

Requests for support, enhancements, and questions should best be
directed to the iperf-dev mailing list. ESnet would be open to adding
project members/committers from the community, in case there are
developers who are interested in doing more active work with iperf3
and/or supporting the user base.

### 2015-10-16: iperf-3.1 released[¶](#iperf-3-1-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/iperf-3.1.tar.gz>

This release adds support for SCTP on supported platforms, better
feature detection on FreeBSD, better compatibility with various
platforms, and a number of bug fixes.

### 2015-01-09: iperf-3.0.11 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-11-released "Link to this heading")

This maintenance release adds a -1 flag to make the iperf3 execute a
single test and exit, needed for an upcoming bwctl release. A few
other bugs are also fixed.

### 2014-12-16: iperf-3.0.10 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-10-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/iperf-3.0.10.tar.gz>
SHA256: `a113442967cf0981b0b2d538be7c88903b2fb0f87b0d281384e41b462e33059d  iperf-3.0.10.tar.gz`

This maintenance release fixes an issue for a situation in which
attempting a UDP test with pathologically large (and illegal) packet
sizes could put the iperf3 server in a state where it would stop
accepting connections from clients, thus causing the clients to crash
when interrupted.

### 2014-09-30: iperf-3.0.8 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-8-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/iperf-3.0.8.tar.gz>

This maintenance release fixes several minor bugs. Of particular
note:

* A bug that caused some problems with bwctl / perfSONAR has been
  fixed.
* A bug that made it possible to disrupt existing, running tests has
  been fixed.

### 2014-07-28: iperf-3.0.6 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-6-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/iperf-3.0.6.tar.gz>
SHA256: `3c5909c9b286b6503ffa141a94cfc588915d6e67f2aa732b08df0af73e21938  iperf-3.0.6.tar.gz`

This maintenance release includes the following bug fixes:

* Several problems with the -B option have been fixed. Also, API
  calls have been added to libiperf to extend this functionality to
  API clients.
* Some portability fixes for OpenBSD and Solaris have been merged from
  the mainline.

As always, more details can be found in the `RELNOTES.md` file in
the source distribution.

### 2014-06-16: Project documentation on GitHub Pages[¶](#project-documentation-on-github-pages "Link to this heading")

iperf3 project documentation can now be found at:

URL: <http://software.es.net/iperf/>

This is a GitHub Pages site. In an ongoing series of steps, content
will be migrated from the iperf3 wiki to GitHub Pages.

### 2014-06-16: iperf-3.0.5 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-5-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/iperf-3.0.5.tar.gz>
SHA256: `e1e1989985b17a4c03b0fa207004ad164b137e37ab0682fecbf5e93bcaa920a6  iperf-3.0.5.tar.gz`

This is the third maintenance release of iperf 3, with few more
enhancements and bug fixes. Highlights:

* A timing issue which caused measurement intervals to be wrong with
  TCP tests on lossy networks has been fixed.
* It is now possible to get (most of) the server-side output at
  the client by using the `--get-server-output` flag.
* A number of bugs with `--json` output have been fixed.

A more extensive list of changes can always be found in the
`RELNOTES.md` file in the source distribution.

Note: An iperf-3.0.4 release was planned and tagged, but not
officially released.

### 2014-06-10: New iperf3 download site[¶](#new-iperf3-download-site "Link to this heading")

iperf3 downloads are now hosted on a new server at ESnet:

URL: <http://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/>

Going forward, new releases will be made available in this directory.
Older releases will, at least for now, continue to also be available
at the previous location.

### 2014-03-26: iperf-3.0.3 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-3-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://stats.es.net/software/iperf-3.0.3.tar.gz>
SHA256: `79daf3e5e5c933b2fc4843d6d21c98d741fe39b33ac05bd7a11c50d321a2f59d  iperf-3.0.3.tar.gz`

This is the second maintenance release of iperf 3.0, containing a few bug fixes and enhancements, notably:

* The structure of the JSON output is more consistent between the
  cases of one stream and multiple streams.
* The example programs once again build correctly.
* A possible buffer overflow related to error output has been fixed.
  (This is not believed to be exploitable.)

More information on changes can be found in the `RELNOTES.md`
file in the source distribution.

### 2014-03-10: iperf-3.0.2 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-2-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://stats.es.net/software/iperf-3.0.2.tar.gz>
SHA256: `3c379360bf40e6ac91dfc508cb43fefafb4739c651d9a8d905a30ec99095b282  iperf-3.0.2.tar.gz`

**Note:** Due to a mistake in the release process, the distribution tarball referred to above is actually not compressed, despite its `.tar.gz` extension. Instead it is an uncompressed tar archive. The file checksum is correct, as are the file contents.

This version is a maintenance release that
fixes a number of bugs, many reported by users, adds a few minor
enhancements, and tracks the migration of the iperf3 project to
GitHub. Of particular interest:

* Build / runtime fixes for CentOS 5, MacOS 10.9, and FreeBSD.
* TCP snd\_cwnd output on Linux in the default output format.
* libiperf is now built as both a shared and static library; by
  default, the iperf3 binary links to the shared library.

More information on changes can be found in the `RELNOTES.md`
file in the source distribution.

### 2014-02-28: iperf migrated to GitHub[¶](#iperf-migrated-to-github "Link to this heading")

The new project page can be found at:

<https://github.com/esnet/iperf>

### 2014-01-10: iperf-3.0.1 released[¶](#iperf-3-0-1-released "Link to this heading")

URL: <http://stats.es.net/software/iperf-3.0.1.tar.gz>
SHA256: `32b419ef634dd7670328c3cecc158babf7d706bd4b3d248cf95965528a20e614 iperf-3.0.1.tar.gz`

During development, there were various distributions of the source
code unofficially released carrying a 3.0.0 version number. Because
of the possibility for confusion, this first public release of iperf3
was numbered 3.0.1.
