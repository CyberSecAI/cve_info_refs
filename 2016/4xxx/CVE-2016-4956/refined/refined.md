Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-4956:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2016-4956. It is consistently mentioned across multiple sources, and the descriptions align with the official CVE description.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   * **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
     - The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1548.  The initial fix did not address broadcast associations, leaving broadcast clients susceptible to being forced into interleave mode.
     - A spoofed broadcast packet can trigger the vulnerable behavior, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
     - Specifically, an attacker can send a broadcast packet with a spoofed source address and non-zero origin timestamp.

   * **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - Incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability ([CVE-2016-1548](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-1548))
     - Improper handling of broadcast packets
     - Lack of proper authentication checks for enabling interleaved mode.

   * **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful attack can cause clients to enter interleaved mode and thus fail to synchronize to the correct time.
     - **Time Change:** Exploitation can result in a time change on the affected client.
     - Clients process packets in the wrong mode and lose synchronization.

   * **Attack Vectors:**
     - Network-based attack using spoofed broadcast packets
   * **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target.
     - The attacker must be able to spoof broadcast packets.
     - The attacker needs to know the target network is using broadcast NTP mode.

**3. Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**

   *   The vulnerability can be triggered even when authentication is enabled on clients.
   *   Clients, once in interleave mode due to an attack, are unable to switch back to non-interleaved mode unless a packet with a zero origin timestamp is received.
   *   Some sources specify that this vulnerability allows an attacker to cause an "interleaved-mode transition and time change" or cause clients to "flip into interleave mode and be exposed to the same vulnerability" as CVE-2016-1548.
    * Mitigation for bug 2978 does not cover interleave (FLAG_XB)

**4. Patch Information**

   * Patched in ntp version 4.2.8p8 and later.
   * Various vendors provide specific update instructions and patch versions.
   * Some vendors recommend workarounds including disabling broadcast mode on clients, implementing BCP38, and other security best practices.

**5. Severity**

   *  Most sources list this vulnerability as having a low to moderate severity.
   *  CVSSv2 scores vary between 2.6 and 5.0.
   * CVSSv3 scores vary between 5.3 and 7.5.

**6. Other Relevant Information:**

   * Several sources emphasize that the vulnerability occurs due to an incomplete fix from a previous CVE.
   * Some vendors note that this vulnerability affects all ntp versions up to and including 4.2.8p7.
   * Multiple vendors released security advisories to address this vulnerability

**7. Summary**

The information across the documents consistently points to CVE-2016-4956 as a vulnerability where a spoofed broadcast packet can cause denial of service by switching broadcast clients to interleaved mode, an incomplete fix of CVE-2016-1548. Exploitation is possible even with authentication enabled. The primary impact is a loss of time synchronization and a potential time shift, and a denial of service. The vulnerability was addressed in NTP version 4.2.8p8.
