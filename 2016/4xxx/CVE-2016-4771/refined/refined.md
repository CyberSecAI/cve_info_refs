*   macOS (OS X Lion v10.7.5 and later)

**Root Cause:** A parsing issue existed in the handling of directory paths.

**Weakness:** Improper path validation.

**Impact:**
*   **iOS:** A local application may be able to access restricted files.
*   **macOS:** A local application may be able to access restricted files.

**Attack Vector:** A local application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a local application on the targeted system.

**Description:** The vulnerability stems from a parsing issue within the operating system's kernel related to handling directory paths. By exploiting this, a local application could potentially bypass access restrictions and gain access to files that should otherwise be protected. The fix involved improving path validation to prevent the bypass.
