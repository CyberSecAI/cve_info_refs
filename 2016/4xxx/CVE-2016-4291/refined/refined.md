The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2016-4291.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow when calculating buffer size leading to heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer Overflow: A 32-bit unsigned integer read from the file is multiplied by 2 and then 4 is added. This operation is not checked for overflow, and can result in a small value due to wrapping around.
- Heap Buffer Overflow: The result of the overflowed calculation is used as the size of the buffer. The application then copies data from the file to this undersized buffer, causing a heap overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Code execution under the context of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
Opening a specially crafted Hangul HShow Document (.hpt).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious .hpt file that triggers the integer overflow when processed by the vulnerable application. No special access is needed to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required in the form of opening the malicious file.
