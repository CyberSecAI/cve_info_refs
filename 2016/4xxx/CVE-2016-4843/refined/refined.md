Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure flaw in Cybozu Mailwise, specifically within the page that displays CGI environment variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The page displaying CGI environment variables inadvertently exposes sensitive session information (cookies). Although these cookies have the `httponly` attribute, preventing access via JavaScript, the CGI environment page makes the values visible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated remote attacker could potentially obtain a user's session information by accessing the vulnerable page.
- **Potential Account Takeover:** With session information, an attacker might be able to impersonate a legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker likely needs a user to visit a specific URL in order to be able to get the session data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Access to Vulnerable Page:** The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the specific CGI environment variable display page.

**Summary**
Cybozu Mailwise versions 5.0.0 through 5.3.2 are vulnerable to information disclosure through the CGI environment variable display page, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain session information. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the cookies are visible on the vulnerable page even if they are not accessible via javascript due to the httponly flag.
