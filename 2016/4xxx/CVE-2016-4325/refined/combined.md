An attacker may use this information to launch attacks without knowing the internal IP address of the device. According to Lantronix, this issue was addressed in version 5.0.1-65 by adding the MAC address of the device to the name.[**CWE-200**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure**The xPrintServer connects to a remote cloud storage, hosted at <http://ltrxips1.appspot.com> and <http://findmyxps.com>.These web applications may expose private information to an unauthenticated attacker. The private information may include file/data uploads, network logs, and the internal IP address of the device. According to Lantronix, this issue was addressed on 5/5/2016 (please see the Resolution below).[**CWE-306**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**An unauthenticated user may be able to upload, modify, or delete files from the xPrintServer remote cloud storage.

Only the private IP address is visible using the findmyxps.com service. The findmyxps.com feature can be disabled in version 5.0.0-66 or above in the Web UI under Printers->Advanced-> Check Disable Internet Services. |
