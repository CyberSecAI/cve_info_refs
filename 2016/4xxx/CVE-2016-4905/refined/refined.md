Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an SQL Injection flaw present in the WP-OliveCart WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially obtain or alter information stored in the database. This could include sensitive data like user details, product information, or order history.
*   The CVSS v3 score suggests a low impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. However, the CVSS v2 score shows a higher impact on all three, potentially indicating that the specific impact may vary depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). This means that the attacker does not require local access to the server to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L). This indicates that the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H), meaning they must be an authenticated user with administrative or similarly elevated access within the WordPress application. This is a critical difference from the other CVEs mentioned in the first document.
*   The attacker does not require user interaction (UI:N).
