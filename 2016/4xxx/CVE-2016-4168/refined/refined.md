**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an input validation issue within Adobe Experience Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is insufficient input validation. This allows for the possibility of injecting malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks can potentially allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement or redirecting to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the injection of malicious input which is not properly validated. This indicates a web-based attack vector where the attacker would be injecting malicious scripts via user input fields or parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply malicious input to the Adobe Experience Manager instance. This suggests they would need a position where they could influence the data submitted to the web application.
