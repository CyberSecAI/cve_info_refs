| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=973759#c0)  Simon Lees   2016-04-04 01:03:06 UTC  ``` There has been several issues raised in imlib2 due to its reliance on giflib providing correct data, due to a giflib bug introduced probably around the giflib 5 series as such it is unlikely that SLED 11 is effected, openSUSE releases are also effected both through imlib2 and evas which uses the same algorithms. While this issue has been reported and fixed in Debian I am yet to see a CVE raised for the issues.  There has been several mailing list threads / patch series for these issues rather then taking them I intend to create new patches based off the upstream authors patches to evas.  <https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/commit/?id=f56e33f429cfc165a5a7e7c75c5b2271ba8b58d8> <https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/commit/?id=dd90b6afadf706aafec9e53a6b1efa8f899ab277>  Original bug report: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=785369>  giflib bug report: <https://sourceforge.net/p/giflib/bugs/94/> giflib fix: <https://sourceforge.net/p/giflib/code/ci/cb88511b50621233ae93858ba38f004726d1bc5d/>  Mailing list threads: [https://www.mail-archive.com/enlightenment-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg80456.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/enlightenment-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg80456.html) [https://www.mail-archive.com/enlightenment-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg80454.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/enlightenment-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg80454.html) [https://www.mail-archive.com/enlightenment-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg80444.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/enlightenment-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg80444.html) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=973759#c1)  Simon Lees   2016-04-04 01:17:55 UTC  ``` From the commit message.

# imlib2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201611-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in imlib2, the worst of
which allows for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/imlib2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.9** |

### Background

imlib2 is an advanced replacement for image manipulation libraries such

several window managers, to display images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in imlib2. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image
file using an application linked against imlib2, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a
Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All imlib2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/imlib2-1.4.9"

```

Debian Bug     : 639414 785369 819818 820206 821732

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in imlib2, an image manipulation
library.

CVE-2011-5326

    Kevin Ryde discovered that attempting to draw a 2x1 radi ellipse
    results in a floating point exception.

CVE-2014-9771

    It was discovered that an integer overflow could lead to invalid
    memory reads and unreasonably large memory allocations.

CVE-2016-3993

    Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that drawing using coordinates from
    an untrusted source could lead to an out-of-bound memory read, which
    in turn could result in an application crash.

CVE-2016-3994

    Jakub Wilk discovered that a malformed image could lead to an
    out-of-bound read in the GIF loader, which may result in an
    application crash or information leak.

CVE-2016-4024

    Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered an integer overflow that could lead to
    an insufficient heap allocation and out-of-bound memory write.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb7u2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.6-2+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your imlib2 packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=973761#c0)  Simon Lees   2016-04-04 02:29:56 UTC  ``` <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=819818>  From Debian Report: 1) I re-compiled imlib2 package with debug information, 2) compiled and installed tests (data, src/bin), 3) run `valgrind imlib2_test`, 4) moved mouse to right lower corner of window;  ==16086== Invalid read of size 1 ==16086==    at 0x4E79C4E: __imlib_MergeUpdate (in  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libImlib2.so.1.4.6) ==16086==    by 0x401773: main (in /usr/bin/imlib2_test) ==16086==  Address 0x9d20360 is 0 bytes after a block of size 1,200 alloc'd ==16086==    at 0x4C28C20: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:296) ==16086==    by 0x4E798E3: __imlib_MergeUpdate (in  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libImlib2.so.1.4.6) ==16086==    by 0x401773: main (in /usr/bin/imlib2_test)  In gdb, it points to src/lib/updates.c:     |                 for (xx = x + 1, ww = 1;                         |   >|                      (T(xx, y).used & T_USED) && (xx < tw); xx++,|    |                 for (yy = y + 1, hh = 1, ok = 1;                 |  xx is 20 and tw is 20, so T(xx, y) addresses one byte out of buffer.  Pretty obvious, off-by-one error due to swapped condition order. In unlucky case, this can result in application crash. Security implications: very minor, DoS at most, only for application  drawing images using coordinates from untrusted source ("drawing images  from untrusted sources" by itself is safe). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=973761#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-04-04 22:00:23 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=973761#c2)  Simon Lees   2016-04-08 07:59:53 UTC  ``` Upstream Commit: <https://git.enlightenment.org/legacy/imlib2.git/commit/?id=ce94edca1ccfbe314cb7cd9453433fad404ec7ef> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=973761#c3)  Sebastian Krahmer   2016-04-11 08:01:27 UTC  ``` CVE-2016-3993 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=973761#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-05-18 12:13:17 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:1330-1: An update that fixes 8 vulnerabilities is now available.
