{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2016-4024",
    "description": "Integer overflow in imlib2 before 1.4.9 on 32-bit platforms allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via large dimensions in an image, which triggers an out-of-bounds heap memory write operation.",
    "affected_components": [
      "imlib2"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when handling image dimensions on 32-bit platforms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Heap Write"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can craft an image with large dimensions, which causes an integer overflow and leads to an out-of-bounds heap write, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted image. An attacker can entice a user to open a malicious image file using an application linked against the vulnerable imlib2 library.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious image file with specific dimensions to trigger the overflow. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is specific to 32-bit platforms due to how integer overflows are handled. This is fixed in imlib2 version 1.4.9."
