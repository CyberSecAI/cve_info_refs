{
  "CVE-2016-4001": {
    "Description": "Qemu emulator built with the Luminary Micro Stellaris Ethernet Controller is vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue. It could occur while receiving network packets in stellaris_enet_receive(), if the guest NIC is configured to accept large(MTU) packets.",
    "Root cause": "Buffer overflow in the stellaris_enet_receive() function when handling large packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can crash the QEMU process on the host, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted network packets to a guest with a Stellaris ethernet controller configured to accept large packets.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the QEMU instance."
