| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1325884#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2016-04-11 12:20:53 UTC  ``` Qemu emulator built with the Luminary Micro Stellaris Ethernet Controller is vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue. It could occur while receiving network packets in stellaris_enet_receive(), if the guest NIC is configured to accept large(MTU) packets.  A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on a host, resulting in DoS.

Donghai Zdh discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Task Priority

Register(TPR). A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue

to possibly leak host memory bytes. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04

LTS, Ubuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-4020](/security/CVE-2016-4020))

Du Shaobo discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB EHCI emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.

| **Date**: | Fri, 8 Apr 2016 11:33:48 +0530 |

---

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

When receiving packets over Stellaris ethernet controller, it
uses receive buffer of size 2048 bytes. In case the controller
accepts large(MTU) packets, it could lead to memory corruption.
Add check to avoid it.

Subject: CVE request: Qemu: net: buffer overflow in stellaris_enet emulator

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the Luminary Micro Stellaris Ethernet Controller is
vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue. It could occur while receiving network
packets in stellaris_enet_receive(), if the guest NIC is configured to accept
large(MTU) packets.

A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on a host,
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-04/msg01334.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1325884>

This issue was discovered by Oleksandr Bazhaniuk of Advanced Threat Research
team at Intel Inc.

Thank you.
