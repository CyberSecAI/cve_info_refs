Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure DLL loading mechanism within the installer of PhishWall Client Internet Explorer version. The installer has a flaw in its DLL search path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading:** The installer does not properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files.
- **DLL Search Path Issue:** The installer's DLL search path is vulnerable, allowing it to load arbitrary DLLs from untrusted locations.
- The installer is built using an old version of InstallShield which contributed to the vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious DLL in a location where the installer searches for DLLs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- Complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CVSS v3: High)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL on the local system where the installer will be executed.
- **User Interaction:** The user must execute the vulnerable installer for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL on the victim's system.
- **Social Engineering (Likely):** The attacker would need to trick the user into running the installer, possibly by having the user place the malicious DLL in the appropriate directory.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of the PhishWall Client Internet Explorer installer up to and including version 3.7.8.1.
- The vendor has released a patched version (3.7.8.2) that addresses the DLL loading issue.
- Users who have already installed PhishWall are not affected, as the vulnerability exists only in the installer
- JPCERT/CC coordinated with the vendor to address this issue.
- This vulnerability was reported by Takashi Yoshikawa of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions.
