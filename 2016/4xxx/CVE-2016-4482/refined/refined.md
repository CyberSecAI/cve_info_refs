Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2016-4482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `proc_connectinfo` function in `drivers/usb/core/devio.c` in the Linux kernel does not properly initialize a `usbdevfs_connectinfo` structure before copying it to user space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The `usbdevfs_connectinfo` structure has padding bytes at the end that are not initialized. When the structure is copied to user space using `copy_to_user`, these uninitialized bytes are also copied, potentially leaking kernel stack memory. This is due to relying on the write system call and not initializing the structure before copying.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Local users can potentially read sensitive data from kernel stack memory by exploiting the information leak.
*   **Denial of Service:** It is also mentioned the possibility of a denial of service (kernel memory write operation) exists, however, the root cause is not well explained. The main vulnerability is the information disclosure through kernel stack memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability via a crafted `USBDEVFS_CONNECTINFO` ioctl call on the `usbfs` device, which is an interface exposed to user space to interact with USB devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Ability to make ioctl calls:** The attacker must have the ability to make ioctl calls to `usbfs` interface.
*   **No special privileges:** An unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Linux kernel versions before 4.5.3, specifically mentioned in the Suse advisory.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "kernel information leak", which would expose kernel stack memory to user space.
*   The upstream fix involves explicitly initializing the structure to zero using `memset`.
*   The Suse information notes that the CVSSv2 rating for SUSE is 6.6 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C) and the CVSSv3 rating is 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   RedHat states that they do not plan to fix this vulnerability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and MRG-2.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in openSUSE Leap 42.1 by updating to kernel version 4.1.26 and in openSUSE Tumbleweed by updating to kernel version 4.8.13.
*   Multiple Linux distributions are affected and have patched this vulnerability.
*   SUSE considers this a moderate security issue, while NVD assigns it a higher severity score.
*  The Suse advisory notes this issue is "Resolved", stating that a patch was issued. The same page contains a note regarding SUSE will no longer be fixing all CVEs in the Linux kernel, but declare some bug classes as "won't fix".
