Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how libarchive handles symbolic links within CPIO archives. Specifically, when a CPIO archive contains a symbolic link with an excessively long target path, memory allocation can fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** If a crafted CPIO archive is processed by an application using a vulnerable version of libarchive, the application could crash due to failed memory allocation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Archive:** An attacker can create a malicious CPIO archive containing a symbolic link with a large target path.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker would need to entice a user or process to open or handle the crafted archive via `libarchive`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Archive:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific type of archive (CPIO) with the malicious symbolic link.
*   **Remote or Local Access:** The attacker may be remote if they can send the malicious archive to the victim.
