Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-4334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Jive social networking platform uses an exit-link tracking mechanism (`external-link.jspa`) for all external links. This mechanism did not validate the target URLs, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of validation on the `url` parameter in the `external-link.jspa` endpoint, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary external websites.
*   **Lack of Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Jive did not initially validate the URLs against a list of authorized URLs nor did it blacklist malicious ones. The platform did not maintain a database of legitimately created links.
*  **Insufficient Remediation:** The initial fix involved an optional warning message via a modal. However, direct GET requests to the exit link bypass the modal, making it ineffective.
*   **Bypass of Email Filtering:** Malicious emails containing these open redirect links may bypass email spam/phishing filters that whitelist the Jive domain (*.jiveon.com).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Spear Phishing:** Attackers can leverage the trust users have in the Jive platform to perform targeted phishing attacks, redirecting them to malicious sites that may steal credentials or infect the user's machine.
*   **Bypass Security Measures:** The redirect can circumvent user awareness training, as users often trust links that start with a familiar domain.
*   **Abuse of User Trust:**  Because Jive uses the redirect for all external links, users are accustomed to the `external-links.jspa` mechanism, which makes malicious redirects more likely to be trusted.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Link Manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs using the `external-link.jspa?url=` endpoint and distribute them through email, social media, or other channels.
*   **Phishing Emails:** Malicious links can be embedded in phishing emails targeting Jive users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of Jive:** Attackers need to be aware of the Jive platform, its exit-link mechanism, and how to construct the malicious redirect URLs.
*   **Target Identification:** Attackers need to identify target Jive instances, often by searching public customer lists or using search queries like "site:jiveon.com".
*   **Ability to Distribute Malicious Links:** Attackers need to distribute malicious links to the target users, for example through phishing emails or other methods.
*   **No Authentication (Initially):**  Initially the vulnerability could be exploited without the user being logged in, but later this appeared to be dependent on instance settings, and the user likely needs to be logged in.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Jive, and an optional configuration setting was added to display a warning page.
*   The initial fix was insufficient as it could be bypassed by direct GET requests, and required the administrators to enable the fix.
*   A later update in version 2016.3.1 added a delay before the redirect. This delay however is not considered helpful.
*   The attacker is more likely to be successful on targeted attacks as users are more likely to be logged in when clicking links on the Jive platform.
*   The report also suggested that Jive could improve security by maintaining a list of permitted URLs or blacklisting known malicious ones.
