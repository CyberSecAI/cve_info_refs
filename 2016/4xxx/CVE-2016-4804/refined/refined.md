Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-4804:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `read_boot` function in `boot.c` of `dosfstools` did not properly handle excessively large FAT size specifications.
- The variable used to store the FAT size (in bytes) was an `unsigned int`, which, when multiplied by the sector size, could result in a value of zero due to integer overflow, despite excessive offsets remaining. This ultimately leads to segmentation faults when accessing FAT entries because insufficient memory was allocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow**: A crafted filesystem with a large FAT size can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in the `read_fat` function. This occurs because the FAT size is not properly validated, and an excessively large allocation is attempted.
- **Out-of-bounds heap read**: A malformed filesystem can also cause an out-of-bounds heap read in the `get_fat` function, due to the inaccurate FAT size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to crashes due to segmentation faults, causing a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu security notice mentions "or possibly execute arbitrary code." While not explicitly detailed, heap overflows can be leveraged to potentially execute arbitrary code, in addition to causing a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted, malformed filesystem to `dosfstools`. The specific vector includes providing a filesystem with an excessively large FAT size specification which is not correctly handled during the parsing of the boot sector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a crafted filesystem to `dosfstools`. This generally means:
    - The attacker can mount a crafted filesystem.
    - The attacker can provide the crafted filesystem via an attached storage medium.

**Additional Notes:**

- Patches were implemented to check that the FAT size is not zero and that there is room for data clusters, and by changing the data types used to store FAT size to `off_t`.
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop and Address Sanitizer.

In summary, CVE-2016-4804 highlights an integer overflow vulnerability that leads to heap corruption in `dosfstools`, triggered by a malformed filesystem with an oversized FAT specification, leading to a denial of service and potential arbitrary code execution. The fix involves validating the FAT size and using a larger data type to store the size to avoid integer overflows.
