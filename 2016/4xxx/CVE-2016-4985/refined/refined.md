{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the `/v1/drivers/$DRIVER_NAME/vendor_passthru` resource of the ironic-api service allowed clients to bypass Keystone authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Ironic API did not properly enforce authentication for requests made to the `vendor_passthru` endpoint. Specifically, the `lookup` function within `vendor_passthru` was returning node details without verifying the user's identity.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the ironic-api service could retrieve full details of any node registered with Ironic, including management passwords.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted POST request sent to the `/v1/drivers/$DRIVER_NAME/vendor_passthru/lookup` endpoint. The request body included an inventory containing the MAC address of a network card belonging to a node.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the ironic-api service and must know or be able to guess the MAC address of a network card associated with a registered Ironic node."
