| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-14 08:56:05 UTC  ``` A client with network access to the ironic-api service can bypass Keystone authentication and retrieve all information about any Node registered with Ironic, if they know (or are able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to that Node, by sending a crafted POST request to the /v1/drivers/$DRIVER_NAME/vendor_passthru resource.  The response will include the full Node details, including management passwords, even when /etc/ironic/policy.json is configured to hide passwords in API responses.  This vulnerability has been verified in all currently supported branches (liberty, mitaka, master) and traced back to code introduced in commit 3e568fbbbcc5748035c1448a0bdb26306470797c during the Juno development cycle. Therefore, it is likely that both juno and kilo branches (and their releases) are also affected.  Affected versions: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=4.2.4, >=4.3.0 <=5.1.1   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-14 08:56:14 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the OpenStack Ironic project Upstream: Devananda van der Veen (IBM)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c6)  Summer Long    2016-06-20 04:12:59 UTC  ``` Eric, could you please do a doc text check on this? thanks, Summer   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c7)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-22 07:18:09 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/579>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c8)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-22 07:21:21 UTC  ```  Created openstack-ironic tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1348817](show_bug.cgi?id=1348817 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-4985 openstack-ironic: Ironic Node information including credentials exposed to unauthenticated users [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c9)  Adam Mariš    2016-06-22 07:21:31 UTC  ```  Created openstack-ironic tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1348818](show_bug.cgi?id=1348818 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-4985 openstack-ironic: Ironic Node information including credentials exposed to unauthenticated users [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-07-04 05:49:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty)  Via RHSA-2016:1378 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1378](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1378)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1346193#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-07-04 05:49:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:1377 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1377](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1377)   ``` |  |

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1378)

## Topic

An update for openstack-ironic is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Bare Metal (ironic) is a tool used to provision bare metal (as opposed to virtual) machines. It leverages common technologies such as PXE boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware. It also supports pluggable drivers to allow added, vendor-specific functionality.

Security Fix(es):

* An authentication vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic. A client with network access to the ironic-api service could bypass OpenStack Identity authentication, and retrieve all information about any node registered with OpenStack Bare Metal. If an unprivileged attacker knew (or was able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to a node, the flaw could be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the node's /v1/drivers/$DRIVER\_NAME/vendor\_passthru resource. The response included the node's full details, including management passwords, even if the /etc/ironic/policy.json file was configured to hide passwords in API responses. (CVE-2016-4985)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Ironic project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Devananda van der Veen (IBM) as the original reporter.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1377)

## Topic

An update for openstack-ironic is now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security
impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Bare Metal (ironic) is a tool used to provision bare metal (as
opposed to virtual) machines. It leverages common technologies such as PXE
boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware. It also supports pluggable
drivers to allow added, vendor-specific functionality.

Security Fix(es):

* An authentication vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic. A client with network access to the ironic-api service could bypass OpenStack Identity authentication, and retrieve all information about any node registered with OpenStack Bare Metal. If an unprivileged attacker knew (or was able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to a node, the flaw could be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the node's /v1/drivers/$DRIVER\_NAME/vendor\_passthru resource. The response included the node's full details, including management passwords, even if the /etc/ironic/policy.json file was configured to hide passwords in API responses. (CVE-2016-4985)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Ironic project for reporting
this issue. Upstream acknowledges Devananda van der Veen (IBM) as the
original reporter.

### Bug Description

Environment:

- servers are Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.4 LTS

- ironic is deployed as part of an OpenStack cloud, configured to use keystone auth

- ironic is running current master (early Newton) + Neutron integration patches (should be completely unrelated)

- agent\_ipmitool driver is enabled

Steps to reproduce:

- enable any of the "agent" class of drivers. For the examples below, let's assume that "agent\_ipmitool" is enabled, but this works if any driver that includes the AgentVendorPassthru interface is loaded, even if the Node is not configured to use that driver.

- register a Node in Ironic with any driver

- register a Port in Ironic and associate it to that Node

- send an \*unauthenticated\* POST request to ${IRONIC\_URL}/v1/drivers/agent\_ipmitool/vendor\_passthru/lookup with the following request body: '{"version": "2", "inventory": { "interfaces": [ { "name": "", "mac\_address": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" } ] } }'

Result:

- receive the complete Node record (an unauthenticated user should not be able to do that)

- bypass ironic API policy enforcement and retrieve the un-masked management credentials for the Node

- also receive the "heartbeat\_timeout" value

Expected result:

- receive only the node UUID and heartbeat\_timeout, because this should be all that the IPA ramdisk requires to continue operating

Example curl command:

curl -X POST -H 'X-OpenStack-Ironic-API-Version: 1.16' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \

  -d '{"version": "2", "inventory": { "interfaces": [ { "name": "", "mac\_address": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" } ] } }' \

  <https://some.url:6385/v1/drivers/agent_ipmitool/vendor_passthru/lookup> | json\_pp

Example result:

{

   "heartbeat\_timeout" : 300,

   "node" : {

      "target\_provision\_state" : null,

      "raid\_config" : {},

DRAFT

-----

Title: Ironic Node information including credentials exposed to unauthenticated users

Reporter: Devananda van der Veen

Products: OpenStack Ironic

Affects: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=5.1.1

Description:

Devananda van der Veen reported the following vulnerability in Ironic.

Anyone with network access to the ironic-api service can bypass Keystone authentication and retrieve all information about any Node registered with Ironic, if they know (or are able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to that Node. The HTTP response will include the full Node details, including management passwords, even when /etc/ironic/policy.json is configured to hide passwords in API responses.

This can be done by sending a request such as the following:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \

'{ "version": "2", "inventory": { "interfaces": [ { "mac\_address": "$ADDRESS" } ] } }' \

[http://$HOST:6385/v1/drivers/$DRIVER/vendor\_passthru/lookup](http://$HOST:6385/v1/drivers/%24DRIVER/vendor_passthru/lookup)

This affects all instances of Ironic where the "enabled\_drivers" setting includes any of the "agent" family of drivers (eg, agent\_ssh, agent\_ipmitool, agent\_ilo). In such an environment, all Nodes may be exposed, even Nodes that are configured with another driver, including even if no Nodes are configured to use any of the agent\_\* drivers.

This vulnerability has been verified in all currently supported branches (liberty, mitaka, master) and traced back to code introduced in commit 3e568fbbbcc5748035c1448a0bdb26306470797c during the Juno development cycle. Therefore, it is likely that both juno and kilo braches (and their releases) are also affected.

Well, since all drivers now use IPA, this probably affects any drivers, right? (other than... fake? maybe?)

Let's update the draft to reflect that.

The master patch LGTM but needs unit tests.

For whatever reason, the mitaka patch doesn't apply for me.

I fetched it with wget, same as the master patch, so not sure what's going on here :/

Forgot to mention, I also tested the master patch, works as expected.

I also tested with enabled\_drivers=pxe\_ssh, just to confirm my theory, and the bug is still present.

@jroll,

I also encounter the unit test failure you hit. I have fixed it on mitaka, and tested the fix against master (works) and liberty (works, but was missing an import, which I have added).

I'm going to upload all three patch files as they're slightly different on the different branches.

Patches LGTM, though to be honest I would just remove the whole driver\_info from the representation. We do not and should not use it in IPA.

Dmitry, while I agree that IPA shouldn't be using that info, I don't know what folks might be doing with downstream HardwareManagers in IPA. As this is part of the API we're currently providing, and this patch needs to be backported to stable branches, my view in developing these patches was to make the least possible change (just mask the password).

There's still a risk that someone, somewhere, has used the IPMI password in the agent, and this change will break them -- and I'm willing to accept that risk in order to close this hole.

These patches apply cleanly with 'git apply foo', and pass 'tox -re pep8,py27' just fine. They need to be rebuilt with 'git format-patch', though, so 'git am' can be used to apply the patches and retain the commit message, etc.

+1 from me if rebuilt.

Dmitry, I think for an embargoed security bug we should change as little as possible, and talk about dropping driver\_info entirely later on with the rest of the community.

Looking at the affected versions in comment #1, assuming the stable/liberty backport will appear in a 4.2.5 point release and the stable/mitaka backport in a 5.1.2 point release (and noting that 4.3.0 is in the stable/mitaka series) I think this becomes:

Affects: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=4.2.4, >=4.3.0 <=5.1.1

Also, the impact description goes into deeper technical detail than the VMT usually would. Rule of thumb is that an impact description should contain enough detail for a user/deployer to determine whether their configuration is affected such that they should upgrade, and to be able to sufficiently disambiguate the current reported vulnerability from future similar vulnerabilities.

Thanks for the feedback, fungi. New draft follows:

------------------

Title: Ironic Node information including credentials exposed to unauthenticated users

Reporter: Devananda van der Veen

Products: OpenStack Ironic

Affects: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=4.2.4, >=4.3.0 <=5.1.1

Description:

Devananda van der Veen (IBM) reported the following vulnerability in Ironic.

A client with network access to the ironic-api service can bypass Keystone authentication and retrieve all information about any Node registered with Ironic, if they know (or are able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to that Node, by sending a crafted POST request to the /v1/drivers/$DRIVER\_NAME/vendor\_passthru resource.

The response will include the full Node details, including management passwords, even when /etc/ironic/policy.json is configured to hide passwords in API responses.

This vulnerability has been verified in all currently supported branches (liberty, mitaka, master) and traced back to code introduced in commit 3e568fbbbcc5748035c1448a0bdb26306470797c during the Juno development cycle. Therefore, it is likely that both juno and kilo braches (and their releases) are also affected.

We don't usually bother looping release management into the disclosure process. As long as there are sufficient core reviewers involved to be able to preapprove and fast-track fixes into the gate at the time of disclosure, the advisory can just reference change URLs. Having a new release ready soon after disclosure would still be good, but the advisory publication timeline doesn't need to depend on it.

Oh, though that said, we do already include a couple of stable branch managers in the pre-disclosure list so they can be aware priority backports are on the way.

All 3 of us here are stable cores, so it should not be a problem.

What worries me that the patch in question does not cover ssh\_key\_contents (or does it?). I know that the ssh drivers are not to be used in production, but they are.

This patch does what we do for the regular node API, so I think I'm okay with it... that said, mask\_password would not cover ssh\_key\_contents (I really wish that wasn't a thing): <https://github.com/openstack/oslo.utils/blob/master/oslo_utils/strutils.py#L55>

I fail to see how the SSH driver could be used in production - it provides no method of controlling an actual bare metal machine.... are people running ironic to provision VMs or?

Yes, people run Ironic to provision VMs, don't ask why please :)

I'm fine with leaving the patches as they are, just making sure people are aware of the SSH issue.

Just to be sure everyone here is in the loop: pre-disclosure is out, this goes public Tuesday June 21 at 1500 UTC.

Deva will submit patches, Dmitry and I will approve them, I'll submit release requests when they are done.

Hopefully won't be too disruptive to the midcycle. :)

Mask password on agent lookup according to policy

We currently mask passwords in driver\_info for all API responses,

    except for agent lookups. This is because driver\_vendor\_passthru

    just expects a dict to return as JSON in the response, and doesn't

    modify it at all.

Change lookup to follow the defined policy when returning the node

    object in the response, the same way we do for other API responses.

Subject: Ironic node information including credentials exposed to
 unathenticated users

=============================================================================
Ironic node information including credentials exposed to unathenticated users
=============================================================================

:Date: June 21, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2016-4985

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Ironic: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=4.2.4, >=4.3.0 <=5.1.1

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Devananda van der Veen (IBM) reported the following vulnerability in Ironic.

A client with network access to the ironic-api service can bypass Keystone
authentication and retrieve all information about any Node registered with
Ironic, if they know (or are able to guess) the MAC address of a network card
belonging to that Node, by sending a crafted POST request to the
/v1/drivers/$DRIVER_NAME/vendor_passthru resource.

The response will include the full Node details, including management
passwords, even when /etc/ironic/policy.json is configured to hide passwords in
API responses.

This vulnerability has been verified in all currently supported branches
(liberty, mitaka, master) and traced back to code introduced in commit
3e568fbbbcc5748035c1448a0bdb26306470797c during the Juno development cycle.
Therefore, it is likely that both juno and kilo braches (and their releases)
are also affected.

### Bug Description

Environment:

- servers are Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.4 LTS

- ironic is deployed as part of an OpenStack cloud, configured to use keystone auth

- ironic is running current master (early Newton) + Neutron integration patches (should be completely unrelated)

- agent\_ipmitool driver is enabled

Steps to reproduce:

- enable any of the "agent" class of drivers. For the examples below, let's assume that "agent\_ipmitool" is enabled, but this works if any driver that includes the AgentVendorPassthru interface is loaded, even if the Node is not configured to use that driver.

- register a Node in Ironic with any driver

- register a Port in Ironic and associate it to that Node

- send an \*unauthenticated\* POST request to ${IRONIC\_URL}/v1/drivers/agent\_ipmitool/vendor\_passthru/lookup with the following request body: '{"version": "2", "inventory": { "interfaces": [ { "name": "", "mac\_address": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" } ] } }'

Result:

- receive the complete Node record (an unauthenticated user should not be able to do that)

- bypass ironic API policy enforcement and retrieve the un-masked management credentials for the Node

- also receive the "heartbeat\_timeout" value

Expected result:

- receive only the node UUID and heartbeat\_timeout, because this should be all that the IPA ramdisk requires to continue operating

Example curl command:

curl -X POST -H 'X-OpenStack-Ironic-API-Version: 1.16' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \

  -d '{"version": "2", "inventory": { "interfaces": [ { "name": "", "mac\_address": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" } ] } }' \

  <https://some.url:6385/v1/drivers/agent_ipmitool/vendor_passthru/lookup> | json\_pp

Example result:

{

   "heartbeat\_timeout" : 300,

   "node" : {

      "target\_provision\_state" : null,

      "raid\_config" : {},

      "instance\_info" : {},

Title: Ironic Node information including credentials exposed to unauthenticated users

Reporter: Devananda van der Veen

Products: OpenStack Ironic

Affects: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=5.1.1

Description:

Devananda van der Veen reported the following vulnerability in Ironic.

Anyone with network access to the ironic-api service can bypass Keystone authentication and retrieve all information about any Node registered with Ironic, if they know (or are able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to that Node. The HTTP response will include the full Node details, including management passwords, even when /etc/ironic/policy.json is configured to hide passwords in API responses.

This can be done by sending a request such as the following:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \

'{ "version": "2", "inventory": { "interfaces": [ { "mac\_address": "$ADDRESS" } ] } }' \

[http://$HOST:6385/v1/drivers/$DRIVER/vendor\_passthru/lookup](http://$HOST:6385/v1/drivers/%24DRIVER/vendor_passthru/lookup)

This affects all instances of Ironic where the "enabled\_drivers" setting includes any of the "agent" family of drivers (eg, agent\_ssh, agent\_ipmitool, agent\_ilo). In such an environment, all Nodes may be exposed, even Nodes that are configured with another driver, including even if no Nodes are configured to use any of the agent\_\* drivers.

This vulnerability has been verified in all currently supported branches (liberty, mitaka, master) and traced back to code introduced in commit 3e568fbbbcc5748035c1448a0bdb26306470797c during the Juno development cycle. Therefore, it is likely that both juno and kilo braches (and their releases) are also affected.

Well, since all drivers now use IPA, this probably affects any drivers, right? (other than... fake? maybe?)

Let's update the draft to reflect that.

The master patch LGTM but needs unit tests.

For whatever reason, the mitaka patch doesn't apply for me.

I fetched it with wget, same as the master patch, so not sure what's going on here :/

Forgot to mention, I also tested the master patch, works as expected.

I also tested with enabled\_drivers=pxe\_ssh, just to confirm my theory, and the bug is still present.

Also, pep8 and unit tests pass on the master patch, even without updating unit tests.

@jroll,

I also encounter the unit test failure you hit. I have fixed it on mitaka, and tested the fix against master (works) and liberty (works, but was missing an import, which I have added).

I'm going to upload all three patch files as they're slightly different on the different branches.

Patches LGTM, though to be honest I would just remove the whole driver\_info from the representation. We do not and should not use it in IPA.

Dmitry, while I agree that IPA shouldn't be using that info, I don't know what folks might be doing with downstream HardwareManagers in IPA. As this is part of the API we're currently providing, and this patch needs to be backported to stable branches, my view in developing these patches was to make the least possible change (just mask the password).

There's still a risk that someone, somewhere, has used the IPMI password in the agent, and this change will break them -- and I'm willing to accept that risk in order to close this hole.

These patches apply cleanly with 'git apply foo', and pass 'tox -re pep8,py27' just fine. They need to be rebuilt with 'git format-patch', though, so 'git am' can be used to apply the patches and retain the commit message, etc.

+1 from me if rebuilt.

Dmitry, I think for an embargoed security bug we should change as little as possible, and talk about dropping driver\_info entirely later on with the rest of the community.

Looking at the affected versions in comment #1, assuming the stable/liberty backport will appear in a 4.2.5 point release and the stable/mitaka backport in a 5.1.2 point release (and noting that 4.3.0 is in the stable/mitaka series) I think this becomes:

Affects: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=4.2.4, >=4.3.0 <=5.1.1

Also, the impact description goes into deeper technical detail than the VMT usually would. Rule of thumb is that an impact description should contain enough detail for a user/deployer to determine whether their configuration is affected such that they should upgrade, and to be able to sufficiently disambiguate the current reported vulnerability from future similar vulnerabilities.

Thanks for the feedback, fungi. New draft follows:

------------------

Title: Ironic Node information including credentials exposed to unauthenticated users

Reporter: Devananda van der Veen

Products: OpenStack Ironic

Affects: >=2014.2, >=4.0.0 <=4.2.4, >=4.3.0 <=5.1.1

Description:

Devananda van der Veen (IBM) reported the following vulnerability in Ironic.

A client with network access to the ironic-api service can bypass Keystone authentication and retrieve all information about any Node registered with Ironic, if they know (or are able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to that Node, by sending a crafted POST request to the /v1/drivers/$DRIVER\_NAME/vendor\_passthru resource.

The response will include the full Node details, including management passwords, even when /etc/ironic/policy.json is configured to hide passwords in API responses.

This vulnerability has been verified in all currently supported branches (liberty, mitaka, master) and traced back to code introduced in commit 3e568fbbbcc5748035c1448a0bdb26306470797c during the Juno development cycle. Therefore, it is likely that both juno and kilo braches (and their releases) are also affected.

We don't usually bother looping release management into the disclosure process. As long as there are sufficient core reviewers involved to be able to preapprove and fast-track fixes into the gate at the time of disclosure, the advisory can just reference change URLs. Having a new release ready soon after disclosure would still be good, but the advisory publication timeline doesn't need to depend on it.

Oh, though that said, we do already include a couple of stable branch managers in the pre-disclosure list so they can be aware priority backports are on the way.

All 3 of us here are stable cores, so it should not be a problem.

What worries me that the patch in question does not cover ssh\_key\_contents (or does it?). I know that the ssh drivers are not to be used in production, but they are.

This patch does what we do for the regular node API, so I think I'm okay with it... that said, mask\_password would not cover ssh\_key\_contents (I really wish that wasn't a thing): <https://github.com/openstack/oslo.utils/blob/master/oslo_utils/strutils.py#L55>

I fail to see how the SSH driver could be used in production - it provides no method of controlling an actual bare metal machine.... are people running ironic to provision VMs or?

Yes, people run Ironic to provision VMs, don't ask why please :)

I'm fine with leaving the patches as they are, just making sure people are aware of the SSH issue.

Just to be sure everyone here is in the loop: pre-disclosure is out, this goes public Tuesday June 21 at 1500 UTC.

Deva will submit patches, Dmitry and I will approve them, I'll submit release requests when they are done.

Hopefully won't be too disruptive to the midcycle. :)

commit affec224977174581d19a2b914772cb0409f633e

Mask password on agent lookup according to policy

We currently mask passwords in driver\_info for all API responses,

    except for agent lookups. This is because driver\_vendor\_passthru

    just expects a dict to return as JSON in the response, and doesn't

    modify it at all.

Change lookup to follow the defined policy when returning the node

    object in the response, the same way we do for other API responses.
