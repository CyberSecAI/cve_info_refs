Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a static out-of-bounds write in the `dissect_ber_integer` function, specifically within the PKTC dissector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A malformed packet can trigger an out-of-bounds write in the `dissect_ber_integer` function.
- The PKTC dissector is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is that Wireshark can crash. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the user attempting to analyze network traffic or a capture file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed packet onto the network that, when captured and analyzed by Wireshark, triggers the crash.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted capture file containing the malformed packet, and then trick a user into opening it with Wireshark, leading to a crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to either inject a specifically crafted network packet onto the wire, or create and distribute a malformed packet capture file, to be opened using Wireshark.
- No specific user privileges are required for exploitation on the victim's system, as the vulnerability is within the Wireshark application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
- The issue was originally reported as bug 12206 in the old Wireshark bug tracker.
- Reproducer capture file provided `asan_static-oob_7fa5ee02e58c_1571_67ca7df7471680864d1d97d14b03c437d2d749d8bba7a3f3.cap`
- Fixed in Wireshark versions 2.0.3 and 1.12.11.
