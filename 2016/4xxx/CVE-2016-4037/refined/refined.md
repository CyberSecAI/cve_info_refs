Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-4037:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the QEMU's USB EHCI (Enhanced Host Controller Interface) emulation. Specifically, the issue is triggered during the processing of split isochronous transfer descriptors (siTDs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Infinite Loop:** A closed loop within the siTD list can cause the QEMU EHCI emulation to enter an infinite loop, consuming excessive CPU cycles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest operating system can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DoS on the host machine by exhausting CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   A malicious guest operating system needs to manipulate the siTD list to create a circular dependency and trigger the infinite loop in the QEMU's EHCI emulation.
-   The attacker requires the ability to configure USB transfers within the virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must have privileged access within the guest operating system. This is because control over USB device transfers usually requires elevated permissions within the guest.
-   The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the USB transfer descriptors, specifically the split isochronous transfer descriptors (siTDs).

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2015-8558, which involved the same type of infinite loop but was triggered using iTDs (isochronous transfer descriptors) instead of siTDs.
- A patch was created to apply a limit to the number of processed iTD/siTD descriptors per frame to mitigate this.
- The issue was discovered by Du Shaobo of Qihoo 360 Inc.
- This issue was considered to have a "Low" security impact and was not addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates but was addressed in Fedora and Ubuntu updates.
