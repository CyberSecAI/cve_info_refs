{
  "CVE-2016-4803": {
    "Description": "The email functionality in dotCMS before 3.5 and 3.3.2 allows email header injection.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation on the subject parameter of the `/dotCMS/sendEmail` endpoint, which allows the injection of newline characters (`\\r\\n` or `%0D%0A`).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Email header injection",
      "Lack of input validation",
	  "No validation of From/To addresses"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary email headers, potentially leading to: \n- Sending emails with spoofed 'from' addresses using a trusted server\n- Sending multipart emails with arbitrary content and attachments.\n- Spamming\n- Phishing attacks",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/dotCMS/sendEmail` endpoint",
      "Manipulating the `subject` parameter by injecting newline characters"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/dotCMS/sendEmail` endpoint, and the ability to generate or re-use valid captcha codes.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability does not require authentication. By injecting newline characters into the subject parameter, attackers can add arbitrary headers to the email. The application's lack of validation also allows attackers to specify any `from` and `to` email addresses. The captcha can be bypassed by reusing the same captcha code as many times as required. The vulnerability was tested on dotCMS version 3.2.1.  The fix is present in versions 3.5 and 3.3.2. XSS in HTML emails and lack of validation of From/To addresses were not fixed."
