{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An infinite loop vulnerability exists in Netty's OpenSslEngine when handling renegotiation due to a bug in handling return codes from OpenSSL native calls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ return code leading to an infinite loop."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to high CPU consumption from the infinite loop.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by initiating a connection with renegotiation enabled."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to establish a connection with the vulnerable server and trigger a renegotiation request. This vulnerability is only present when renegotiation is enabled, which is the default setting. Systems using `SslProvider.OpenSsl` are affected."
