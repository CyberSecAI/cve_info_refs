Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4265:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader DC handles FlateDecode streams. A specially crafted FlateDecode stream can cause the application to read beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.
- Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read can expose sensitive information from the application's memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data residing in the application's memory space. This information could be used in further attacks.
- Potential for Code Execution: While this vulnerability by itself is only an information disclosure, the advisory notes that it can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF File: An attacker can embed a crafted FlateDecode stream in a PDF file. When the victim opens the malicious PDF file with a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader DC, the vulnerability can be triggered.
- Malicious Web Page: An attacker can host a malicious page that contains the crafted FlateDecode stream. If a user visits the malicious page with a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader, the vulnerability may be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file or web page to the victim.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the victim's machine.
- User interaction is required; the user must open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat and Reader DC and XI versions for both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Steven Seeley of Source Incite.
- Adobe released security updates on July 7, 2016, to patch this vulnerability.
- The ZDI advisory mentions Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['30599'].
