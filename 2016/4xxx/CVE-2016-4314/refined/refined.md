Relevant to CVE-2016-4314.

Vulnerability: Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Root Cause: The `downloadArchivedLogFiles` operation in the `LogViewer` admin service of WSO2 Carbon 4.4.5 allows authenticated users to download arbitrary files from the file system. The service accepts a file path relative to the Carbon log file directory (i.e., `<WSO2_PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/logs`), but does not properly sanitize or validate the input, allowing attackers to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside of the intended log directory.

Weakness: Insufficient input validation on the `logFile` parameter in the `downloadgz-ajaxprocessor.jsp` endpoint.

Impact:
-Exposure of sensitive information, such as database credentials (e.g., MySQL passwords stored in `registry.xml` or `master-datasources.xml`), truststore keys, and web application configuration files (`web.xml`).
-Compromise of the WSO2 Carbon platform and potentially other systems if exposed credentials are used.

Attack Vector:
-An authenticated user sends a crafted HTTP request to the `downloadgz-ajaxprocessor.jsp` endpoint, providing a malicious `logFile` parameter that includes directory traversal sequences to access arbitrary files.

Required Capabilities:
-The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WSO2 Carbon platform.
-The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the `downloadgz-ajaxprocessor.jsp` endpoint.
