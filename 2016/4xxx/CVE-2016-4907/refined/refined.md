- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cybozu Garoon contains an information disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, a CSRF token can be exposed if a user performs a specific action while an attacker eavesdrops on the communication.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability (CWE-200). Exposure of CSRF tokens.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who can eavesdrop on communication during a specific user action can obtain the CSRF token. This token could potentially be used to perform actions on behalf of the user.

- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. The attacker needs to eavesdrop on network communication.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to eavesdrop on network communication between the user and the Cybozu Garoon server. The attacker also needs the user to perform specific actions that expose the CSRF token.
