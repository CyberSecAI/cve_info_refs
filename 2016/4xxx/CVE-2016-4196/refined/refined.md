Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-4196:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Adobe Reader DC handles XPath expressions within a specific "if" element. This improper handling leads to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core vulnerability is that a specially crafted PDF with a particular "if" element and XPath expression can cause Adobe Reader DC to write data past the allocated memory boundaries. This is a memory corruption issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Adobe Reader DC. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Documents:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted malicious PDF document.
*   **Malicious Web Pages:**  A user could be lured to visit a malicious web page that delivers the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft a Malicious PDF:** The attacker must be able to create a PDF document containing a specific "if" element and a crafted XPath expression that triggers the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires a user to either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page. Thus, this is not a zero-click vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID `24712`.
*   Adobe has released an update to address this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2016-4196 is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to gain remote code execution on a vulnerable system through a crafted PDF file due to an out-of-bounds write error when processing an XPath expression. User interaction is necessary, making social engineering a component of the attack.
