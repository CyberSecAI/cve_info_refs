## Description

lib/http2/connection.c in H2O before 1.7.3 and 2.x before 2.0.0-beta5 mishandles HTTP/2 disconnection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

h2: use after free on premature connection close [#920](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/920)

```
lib/http2/connection.c:on_read() calls parse_input(), which might free
`conn`. It does so in particular if the connection preface isn't
the expected one in expect_preface(). `conn` is then used after the free
in `if (h2o_timeout_is_linked(&conn->_write.timeout_entry)`.
We fix this by adding a return value to close_connection that returns a
negative value if `conn` has been free'd and can't be used anymore.

Credits for finding the bug to Tim Newsham.

### @kazuho **[kazuho](/kazuho)** commented [May 26, 2016](#issue-156888427) • edited Loading

A use-after-free vulnerability has been reported by Tim Newsham and fixed by [Frederik Deweerdt](https://github.com/deweerdt).

CVE-ID for this issue is [CVE-2016-4817](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-32wr-c4w3-hg28 "CVE-2016-4817"). The issue has been fixed in version 1.7.3 and version 2.0.0-beta5. Users are encouraged to update to the latest versions.

The issue is that when H2O tries to disconnect a premature HTTP/2 connection, it calls free(3) to release memory allocated for the connection and immediately after then touches the memory. No malloc-related operation is performed by the same thread between the time it calls free and the time the memory is touched.

Therefore, it is estimated that the exploitability of the issue depends on if an attacker can overwrite the memory chunk at the appropriate moment from another thread (note: the number of threads used to accept incoming connections are governed by [num-threads](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/base_directives.html#num-threads) configuration directive).

In case the issue is exploitable, then it would mean that a remote attacker can mount a DoS attack against H2O, or at worst result in remote code execution.

We would like to thank the aforementioned people for finding and fixing the issue.

Sorry, something went wrong.
