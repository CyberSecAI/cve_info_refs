# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2420273.1).

Many industry experts anticipate that exploits leveraging known flaws in modern processor designs will continue to be disclosed for the foreseeable future (i.e., “Spectre” variants). For information related to these issues, please refer to:

* the January 2018 Critical Patch Update (and later) Advisories,
* the "Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754)" ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)), and
* "Information about processor vulnerabilities CVE-2018-3640 ("Spectre v3a") and CVE-2018-3639 ("Spectre v4")" ([Doc ID 2399123.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2399123.1)).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  13 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2018), [My Oracle Support Note 2379675.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2379675.1).

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 44 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  38 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2394520.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2394520.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

#### Description

If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).

# [R1] Nessus 8.3.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Two separate third-party components (OpenSSL and Moment.js) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled libraries to address the potential impact of these issues in Nessus. Nessus 8.3.0 updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.2r and Moment.js to 2.19.3 to address the identified vulnerabilities.

Note: The CVSSv2 score used in this advisory reflects CVE-2016-4055, as it is considered the highest risk.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus 8.3.0 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus)
