- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Bzip2 parsing functionality of Lexmark Perceptive Document Filters. This occurs because a user-controlled value determines how many bits to read, and this value is used as a counter in a loop. The loop continuously writes null bytes into a buffer, and the counter never changes, causing an infinite loop which results in writing beyond the allocated buffer, thus causing a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to an infinite loop during the processing of a crafted Bzip2 file, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the out-of-bounds write caused by the stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted Bzip2 file can trigger the vulnerability when processed by Lexmark Perceptive Document Filters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted Bzip2 file to the vulnerable software. No specific privileges are required besides being able to submit a malicious file for processing.
