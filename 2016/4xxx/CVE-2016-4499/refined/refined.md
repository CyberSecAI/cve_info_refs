Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-4499:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, a specially crafted project file can cause a heap buffer overrun in a `memcpy` call within the `OPNISAMX` function. Another advisory from the same source notes a heap buffer overflow in the `GetBlock` method of the `HEAPSTREAM` object when processing a project file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122, CWE-787)
*   The program does not properly validate the size of the data being copied, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote code execution: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
*   Application crash: The buffer overflow can lead to the program crashing. While not the primary impact, this denial of service is a consequence of the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Malicious project files: An attacker can craft a malicious project file designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
*   User interaction: The exploit requires the user to open the malicious project file using the vulnerable Panasonic FPWIN Pro software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to create a malicious project file.
*   Ability to convince a user to open the malicious project file. This may involve social engineering techniques.
*   Local Access (as described by the ICS advisory): The user has to be local and interact directly with the malicious file and vulnerable software.
*   Remote Access (as described by the ZDI advisories): While the user still has to open the file, the attacker does not need to be local and could have delivered the malicious project file via other means like a network share or website.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Panasonic FPWIN Pro software.
*   Versions 5.x, 6.x, and 7.122 and prior are affected.
*   Panasonic has released a new version (7.130) to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability with specific filter IDs.

The ZDI advisories indicate that the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution with a CVSS v2 score of 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P), which is a higher risk than the one noted by the ICS advisory CVSS v3 base score of 4.2 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
