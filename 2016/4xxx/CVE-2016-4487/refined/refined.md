{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the demangling of virtual tables within the `gnu_special` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to an invalid write and read due to incorrect memory allocation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Segmentation fault due to writing out-of-bounds.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted mangled C++ symbol names.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a specially crafted mangled symbol to the demangler."
