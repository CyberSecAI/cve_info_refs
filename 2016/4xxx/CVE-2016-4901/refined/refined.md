Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The installer of the e-Tax Software contains a vulnerability due to an insecure DLL search path. This means the installer might load a malicious DLL file if it's placed in a specific location the software searches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL loading:** The software doesn't properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files. It's vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the installer. This could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File System:** The attacker must place a malicious DLL into a directory that the installer searches when loading libraries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into placing a malicious DLL in a specific location.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the target file system. They can't exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Summary of Findings:**
The vulnerability is a classic DLL hijacking issue where the e-Tax installer searches for DLLs in an insecure manner. An attacker can exploit it by getting a user to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the userâ€™s privileges. The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
