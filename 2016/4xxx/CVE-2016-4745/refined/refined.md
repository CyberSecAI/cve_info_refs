- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A timing side channel allowed an attacker to determine the existence of user accounts on a system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Timing side channel vulnerability in the Kerberos v5 PAM module
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can determine the existence of user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker over the network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the target system.
