- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability was due to the usage of the RC4 cryptographic algorithm which has known weaknesses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of the RC4 cipher which has known cryptographic weaknesses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to exploit weaknesses in the RC4 cryptographic algorithm.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability exists within the ServerDocs server component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable ServerDocs service to exploit the RC4 weakness.
