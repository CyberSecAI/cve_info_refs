Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the handling of `DspFuncLib` in Apple OS X.
*   Specifically, a reference was not properly removed after freeing an object in a function table.
*   An earlier version of the advisory mentioned the issue is caused by failing to properly check function IDs before removing items from the function table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to it is still in use, leading to potential corruption or unexpected behavior.
*   Improper memory management. The system fails to properly manage the lifecycle of the object related to function table entries, causing the reference to be dangling after the memory has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code under the context of the kernel.
*   This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local.
*   User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability; the target needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. This likely indicates that a crafted audio file or other type of file format is necessary to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable machine.
*   They need to be able to get the victim to interact with a malicious page or open a malicious file, likely one that contains crafted audio data.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was discovered by Juwei Lin of Trend Micro.
* Apple addressed this vulnerability in OS X El Capitan v10.11.6 and Security Update 2016-004.
* The advisory has a CVSS score of 6.9, with an exploitability vector of AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C.
