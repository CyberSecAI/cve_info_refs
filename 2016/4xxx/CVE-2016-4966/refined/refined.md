{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The diagnosis_control.php page has a tcpdump function that allows capturing and downloading FortiWAN data packets. The application does not properly validate the username parameter, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication by modifying the HTTP GET parameter 'UserName' to 'Administrator'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data (CWE-302)"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated, non-administrative user can download a PCAP file containing all captured packets from the FortiWAN device since the tcpdump function was activated, potentially exposing sensitive network traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the diagnosis_control.php page with a modified 'UserName' parameter.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FortiWAN device with non-administrative privileges and have the ability to modify HTTP GET parameters."
