{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Fernet token provider in OpenStack Keystone was not correctly maintaining audit IDs during token rescoping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect audit IDs in Keystone Fernet tokens leading to a revocation bypass.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially bypass token revocation mechanisms, making it impossible to properly revoke a chain of tokens. This can lead to unauthorized access and persistence.",
  "Attack vectors": "By rescoping a token, an attacker receives a new token with incorrect audit_ids.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have a valid unscoped token and the ability to request a new token with a different scope."
