#### Description

The fix for [3007](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3007) in ntp-4.2.8p7 contained a bug that could cause `ntpd` to crash.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page).
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p8 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* If you cannot upgrade from 4.2.8p7, the only other alternatives are to patch your code or filter `CRYPTO_NAK` packets.
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.

---

#### Credit

This weakness was discovered by Nicolas Edet of Cisco.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has three fixes
is now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p8 to fix five security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2016-4953: Bad authentication demobilizes ephemeral associations
(bsc#982065).
- CVE-2016-4954: Processing spoofed server packets (bsc#982066).
- CVE-2016-4955: Autokey association reset (bsc#982067).
- CVE-2016-4956: Broadcast interleave (bsc#982068).
- CVE-2016-4957: CRYPTO\_NAK crash (bsc#982064).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- Keep the parent process alive until the daemon has finished
initialisation, to make sure that the PID file exists when the parent
returns.
- bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker process to
avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.
- bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().

- bsc#979981: ntp-wait does not accept fractional seconds, so use 1
instead of 0.2 in ntp-wait.service.
- Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems
when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1, which is
needed e.g. by "rcntp addserver".

SUSE Security Update: Security update for ntp
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2016:1584-1
Rating: important
References: #979302 #981422 #982056 #982064 #982065 #982066

Cross-References: CVE-2016-4953 CVE-2016-4954 CVE-2016-4955
CVE-2016-4956 CVE-2016-4957
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Debuginfo 11-SP4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has three fixes
is now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p8 to fix five security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2016-4953: Bad authentication demobilizes ephemeral associations
(bsc#982065).
- CVE-2016-4954: Processing spoofed server packets (bsc#982066).
- CVE-2016-4955: Autokey association reset (bsc#982067).
- CVE-2016-4956: Broadcast interleave (bsc#982068).
- CVE-2016-4957: CRYPTO\_NAK crash (bsc#982064).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- Keep the parent process alive until the daemon has finished
initialisation, to make sure that the PID file exists when the parent
returns.
- bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker process to
avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.
- bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().
- Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems
when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1, which is
needed e.g. by "rcntp addserver".

| [Description](#c0)  Bernd Westermann    2004-07-07 14:21:00 UTC  ``` No ldap and mozilla support in openoffice  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.    Please add --enable-mozilla in openoffice-1.1.1-r1 (etc.) to the configure  part.    ex.: ./configure --enable-gcc3 <..many more..> --enable-mozilla || die ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Wojciech Myrda    2004-07-10 01:19:35 UTC  ``` yes that would be a nice extension to have ex.--enable-mozilla. Question is however, is really nessesery to have it? Does the ./configure script find it on its own? Have you tried checking it? However implementing it would give more control over the building process... I am waiting to see it as well  P.S. Personally I never tried to compile OOo, because lack of space on my /var ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Bernd Westermann    2004-07-12 00:45:37 UTC  ``` Without --enable-mozilla OO will not use mozilla adds like LDAP etc. ./configure is not searching for mozilla libs, because OO has its own mozilla code build in. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Paul de Vrieze (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-03 02:05:25 UTC  ``` Last time I checked it would just fail on missing mozilla libraries. If you tr(y/ied) enabling that option and it actually works (runs even) please report back. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Bernd Westermann    2004-08-03 03:14:52 UTC  ``` Yes it works (for me). I think there are build in mozilla libs/source!? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Andreas Proschofsky (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-23 12:06:25 UTC  ``` There is a good reason this is not enabled, it breaks a lot, so until the code regarding to this gets sane, won't do this ``` |  |

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

Mitigation:         Implement BCP-38.         Upgrade to 4.2.8p8, or later, from the NTP Project Download Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page         If you cannot upgrade from 4.2.8p7, the only other alternatives are to patch your code or filter CRYPTO_NAK packets.         Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has four fixes
is now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p8 to fix five security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2016-4953: Bad authentication demobilizes ephemeral associations
(bsc#982065).
- CVE-2016-4954: Processing spoofed server packets (bsc#982066).
- CVE-2016-4955: Autokey association reset (bsc#982067).
- CVE-2016-4956: Broadcast interleave (bsc#982068).
- CVE-2016-4957: CRYPTO\_NAK crash (bsc#982064).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- Keep the parent process alive until the daemon has finished
initialisation, to make sure that the PID file exists when the parent
returns.
- bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker process to
avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.
- bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().
- bsc#979981: ntp-wait does not accept fractional seconds, so use 1
instead of 0.2 in ntp-wait.service.
- Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems
when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1, which is
needed e.g. by "rcntp addserver".

FreeBSD-SA-16:24.ntp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities of ntp
Category: contrib
Module: ntp
Announced: 2016-06-04
Credits: Network Time Foundation and various contributors listed below
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2016-06-03 08:59:21 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE)
2016-06-04 05:46:52 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p5)

2016-06-04 05:46:52 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p44)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-4957, CVE-2016-4953, CVE-2016-4954, CVE-2016-4955
CVE-2016-4956
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the NTP suite:
The fix for Sec 3007 in ntp-4.2.8p7 contained a bug that could cause ntpd to
crash. [CVE-2016-4957, Reported by Nicolas Edet of Cisco]
An attacker who knows the origin timestamp and can send a spoofed packet
containing a CRYPTO-NAK to an ephemeral peer target before any other
response is sent can demobilize that association. [CVE-2016-4953, Reported by
Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat]
An attacker who is able to spoof packets with correct origin timestamps
from enough servers before the expected response packets arrive at the
target machine can affect some peer variables and, for example,
cause a false leap indication to be set. [CVE-2016-4954, Reported by
Jakub Prokes of Red Hat]
An attacker who is able to spoof a packet with a correct origin timestamp
before the expected response packet arrives at the target machine can
send a CRYPTO\_NAK or a bad MAC and cause the association's peer variables
to be cleared. If this can be done often enough, it will prevent that
association from working. [CVE-2016-4955, Reported by Miroslav Lichvar
of Red Hat]
The fix for NtpBug2978 does not cover broadcast associations, so broadcast
clients can be triggered to flip into interleave mode. [CVE-2016-4956,
Reported by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.]
III. Impact
Malicious remote attackers may be able to break time synchronization,
or cause the ntpd(8) daemon to crash.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce the risk associated with the attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:24/ntp.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:24/ntp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
