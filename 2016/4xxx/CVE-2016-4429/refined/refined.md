{
  "CVE-2016-4429": {
    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the clntudp_call function in sunrpc/clnt_udp.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly unspecified other impact via a flood of crafted ICMP and UDP packets.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `clntudp_call` function allocates a buffer on the stack using `alloca` to store the payload of incoming socket errors. When a malicious server floods the client with crafted ICMP and UDP packets, it can cause the client to repeatedly allocate such temporary buffers until stack overflow occurs. The size of the allocated buffer depends on the request size.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Use of alloca in a loop"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (crash) or possibly unspecified other impact due to a stack frame overflow. Potentially, if the stack pointer steps over the guard page, it could lead to further issues beyond just denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote server sending crafted ICMP and UDP packets"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A remote server is needed to send crafted ICMP and UDP packets. No authentication is required."

    "affected_components": [
      "glibc",
