Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `Array.splice` method in Apple Safari and WebKit.
- The core issue is the failure to properly validate if the array's length has changed during the processing of user-supplied arguments to the `splice` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds Access:** The vulnerability allows for out-of-bounds access to array memory.
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of array length changes leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process (Safari).
- **Remote Code Execution:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage that exploits this vulnerability.
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can embed the exploit in a malicious file, potentially triggered when opened in Safari.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability can be triggered through a web page or a malicious file.
- **User Interaction:** The user must visit the malicious page or open the malicious file for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Products:** Apple Safari browser, and components of iOS, macOS, and tvOS that use WebKit.
- **Mitigation:** Apple has released updates to address this vulnerability.
- **Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS Protection:** Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users were protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID 24585.

**In summary, CVE-2016-4622 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apple Safari and WebKit due to improper handling of array length changes during `Array.splice` operations, allowing for out-of-bounds memory access and corruption. This can be exploited by luring users to visit malicious websites or open malicious files.**
