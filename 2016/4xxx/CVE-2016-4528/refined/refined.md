**Root Cause:** A classic buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Advantech WebAccess due to a lack of input size checking when handling specially crafted DLL files.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **CWE-120:** Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')

**Impact:** A successful exploit of the buffer overflow can lead to a denial of service (application crash).

**Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application, which can load a malicious DLL file from an untrusted source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to convince the local user to load a malicious DLL. This requires user interaction and social engineering.
