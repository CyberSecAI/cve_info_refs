  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from an input validation flaw in Squid's mime_get_header_field() function. This function, responsible for searching headers within HTTP requests, fails to correctly handle specially crafted Host headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary vulnerability is a header smuggling issue, arising from the lack of proper validation of the Host header within HTTP requests.",
      "The flaw allows a client to bypass same-origin policy protections, potentially leading to cache poisoning."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, by bypassing same-origin security protections, an attacker might cause Squid, when operating as an interception or reverse proxy, to contact the wrong origin server.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request that includes a malicious Host header.",
        "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send an HTTP request with a crafted Host header. No special privileges are required for the exploitation."
