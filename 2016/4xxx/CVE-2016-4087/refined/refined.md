- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input validation vulnerability when the debug switch is enabled. Specifically, the lack of input validation for malformed DNS packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access. An attacker sends crafted, malformed DNS packets to the target device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device. Additionally, the debug switch on the target device must be enabled.
