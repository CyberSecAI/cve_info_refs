Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-4568:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking in the `__fill_v4l2_buffer()` function within the Linux kernel's `videobuf2-v4l2` subsystem. When a buffer is dequeued using `VIDIOC_DQBUF` IOCTL, the exact buffer to be dequeued is not known until it's removed from the queue. The number of planes associated with a buffer is specific to the buffer itself, and not to the queue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Plane Array Size Check:** The `__fill_v4l2_buffer()` function uses the number of planes from the dequeued `videobuf2` buffer. It then copies data into a user-provided `m.planes` array, which is allocated in `video_usercopy()` in `v4l2-ioctl.c`. However, the function does not verify if the user-provided `m.planes` array has sufficient space to accommodate all the planes in the dequeued buffer.
*   **Kernel Memory Overwrite:** When the user provides a `v4l2_buffer` struct with fewer planes than the dequeued `videobuf2` buffer actually contains, `__fill_v4l2_buffer()` overwrites kernel memory (the `m.planes` array).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Memory Corruption:** Exploiting the vulnerability leads to overwriting kernel memory with potentially attacker-controlled data. This can result in a denial of service (kernel crash) and potentially other forms of arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **IOCTL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `VIDIOC_DQBUF` IOCTL when dequeuing video buffers.
*   **Malicious User:** A malicious user-space application could crafted a `v4l2_buffer` struct with an insufficient size to trigger the overwrite vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User-Level Access:** The attacker needs to have user-level access to a system with a vulnerable kernel.
*   **Video Device Access:** The attacker must be able to interact with a video device that uses the `videobuf2-v4l2` subsystem.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `b0e0e1f83de3` and fixed by commit `2c1f6951a8a82e6de0d82b1158b5e493fc6c54ab`.
*   The fix involves adding a verification of the planes array size before using the provided user struct.
*   The vulnerability is present in kernel versions 4.4 and later before the fix.
