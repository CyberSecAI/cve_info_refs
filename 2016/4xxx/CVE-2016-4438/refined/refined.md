Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-4438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Apache Struts 2 REST Plugin handles user-supplied input. Specifically, it's possible to inject a malicious expression, which, when processed by the server, leads to arbitrary code execution. This indicates insufficient input validation within the REST plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code remotely.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided expressions, enabling the injection of malicious code.
- **OGNL Expression Injection:** The vulnerability leverages the Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can have a variety of impacts, from data breaches to complete system compromise.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive data, modify system configurations, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **REST Plugin:** The attack specifically targets web applications using the REST Plugin of Apache Struts 2.
- **Malicious Expression Injection:** The attack vector involves passing a specially crafted OGNL expression as user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Access:**  An attacker does not need to authenticate to the application, making it broadly accessible.
- **Ability to craft a malicious OGNL expression:** The attacker must possess some knowledge to craft a malicious OGNL expression.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apache Struts versions 2.3.20 through 2.3.28.1.
- The vulnerability is identified as S2-037 in Apache Struts documentation.
- Exploit code is publicly available.
- The vulnerability requires upgrading to Apache Struts version 2.3.29 to remediate.
- A workaround is not possible due to the changes needed in OGNL and how Struts uses OGNL.
- Red Hat has acknowledged that some products' source code packages contain the vulnerable Struts 2 library. They recommend that if customers build artifacts from source code, they remove struts2 jar files.
- Oracle's July 2017 Critical Patch Update addressed this vulnerability by updating affected components such as Oracle WebLogic Server and Oracle Policy Automation.
- JVN rates the vulnerability as medium severity with a CVSS v3 score of 5.6 and a CVSS v2 score of 6.8.

In summary, CVE-2016-4438 is a serious remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts 2, specifically within the REST plugin, caused by improper input validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious OGNL expressions and execute arbitrary code remotely without authentication.
