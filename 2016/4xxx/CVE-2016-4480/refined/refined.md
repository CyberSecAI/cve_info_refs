Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-4480:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Xen hypervisor's software page table walker. Specifically, it incorrectly handles the Page Size (PS) bit in L4 and (on specific hardware) L3 page table entries. The hypervisor was ignoring this bit, leading to pages being treated as page tables even if the guest OS did not designate them as such.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the Page Size (PS) bit in the hypervisor's page table walking logic.
- The hypervisor incorrectly interprets page table entries, potentially causing a mismatch between how the hypervisor and the guest operating system manage memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Guest user mode code could potentially establish mappings to arbitrary memory within the guest.
- This could allow privilege escalation within the guest operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack occurs within the guest operating system.
- An attacker needs to have the ability to influence the page tables of a guest.
- If a page in question is writable by an unprivileged user, that user can map arbitrary guest memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user inside a Xen guest instance with the ability to manipulate page tables.
- The attacker needs to be running on a vulnerable operating system that makes non-standard use of the PS bit.

**Additional Notes:**
- According to the Xen advisory, ARM systems and x86 PV guests are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability requires both a vulnerable hypervisor and a vulnerable guest operating system.
- Maintained operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris are not believed to be vulnerable because they don't make non-standard use of the PS bit.
- The Oracle bulletin also mentions that this vulnerability affects Oracle VM Server for x86 versions 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
- A patch is available to resolve the issue, and it's recommended to apply it as soon as possible.
- This CVE is also mentioned in Debian Security Advisory DSA-3633-1, affecting the `xen` package in Debian.
