Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Apache CXF Fediz application plugins do not properly validate SAML `AudienceRestriction` values against the list of configured audience URIs.  The code was not performing the matching of the audience URIs at all.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Audience Restriction Validation:** The core issue is the lack of validation of SAML token's `AudienceRestriction` against configured URIs, which should ensure that a token is intended for the specific service.
- **Trust of Untrusted Tokens:** Due to the lack of validation, any token (assuming that signature is valid) could be accepted by the application plugin, regardless of whether the token was intended for this service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Token Replay / Impersonation:** An attacker could potentially use a SAML token intended for a different service on the vulnerable application. This could lead to unauthorized access or other forms of impersonation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft or obtain a valid SAML token intended for a different service and present it to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid SAML token that has a valid signature (which would be trusted by the service), but the `AudienceRestriction` is not targeted for the vulnerable service. They also need network access to the vulnerable service to present the token.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache CXF Fediz versions 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.3.0.
- The fix was implemented in commit `0006581e9cacbeef46381a223e5671e524d416b6`.
- The fix involves changes to `FedizContext.java` and `SigninHandler.java` to implement the missing audience restriction check.
- Upgrading to versions 1.2.3 or later for 1.2.x users and 1.3.1 or later for 1.3.x users is recommended.
- Versions 1.1.x are not affected by this vulnerability.
