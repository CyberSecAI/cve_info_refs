- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer of "The JPKI user's software" contains an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading due to a flawed DLL search path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a specific location where the installer searches for DLLs. The user must then execute the installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in the vulnerable location. The user then has to execute the installer.
