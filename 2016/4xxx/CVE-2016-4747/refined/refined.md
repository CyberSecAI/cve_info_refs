- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed when handling untrusted certificates in the Mail application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of untrusted certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a privileged network position may be able to intercept mail credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A privileged network position is required to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept communication between the Mail application and the mail server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to intercept network traffic.
