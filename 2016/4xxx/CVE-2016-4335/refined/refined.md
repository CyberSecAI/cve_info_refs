- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow in the parsing of XLS documents within Lexmark Perceptive Document Filters. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the `cbLength` field within the MSOFBH structure is handled during the processing of Escher stream data. The size value is read directly from the XLS document and is used in a memcpy to a stack based buffer of fixed size, without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when reading the `cbLength` field of the MSOFBH structure.
    - Use of a size value directly from user-controlled input in a `memcpy` without proper validation or sanitization
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious XLS file, trigger the overflow, and overwrite the return address on the stack, thus achieving arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted XLS document.
    - An attacker would need to get the target system to process the malicious XLS file using the vulnerable Lexmark software. This could be achieved via methods such as email, web downloads, or other file-sharing mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted XLS document to a system that uses the vulnerable Lexmark Perceptive Document Filters. The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges.
    - The attacker needs to understand the structure of the XLS document and the Escher stream to modify the `cbLength` field correctly to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
