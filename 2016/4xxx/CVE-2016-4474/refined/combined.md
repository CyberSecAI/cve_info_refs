| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1342412#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-03 08:46:26 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in the overcloud-full images. A default root password is set.  The build process for the input and utility images is a simple kickstart build process.  The image build process for the shipping images involves booting the "utility" image in a VM and running commands on the image. The commands take the input image as a seed RHEL image and customizes it for our use case installing all the relevant OpenStack packages.  The problem in this case is that our kickstart for the input image has:  rootpw ROOTPW   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1342412#c3)  Garth Mollett    2016-06-09 07:59:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: David Patterson (Dell)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1342412#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-13 19:31:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty) director  Via RHSA-2016:1222 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1222](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1222)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1342412#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-13 21:25:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform director 7.0 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:1223 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1223](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1223)   ``` |  |

# Director - Default root password set in Overcloud images - CVE-2016-4474

Impact

* Overview
* Impact
* Resolve

A vulnerability was discovered in overcloud images used by Red Hat OpenStack director to deploy OpenStack environments, where all shipped images have the same default root password.

## Background Information

Overcloud images are built by booting a "utility" Red Hat Enterprise Linux image in a virtual machine, and customizing the image for director usage by installing all relevant OpenStack packages. However, the utility image had the following parameter configured, and this parameter was not changed during customization:

rootpw ROOTPW

As a result, all shipped images had the default root password of "ROOTPW".

## Take Action

All Red Hat customers with OpenStack environments which were deployed by impacted director versions are strongly recommended to apply mitigations to their systems. Any new deployments should only use the updated Overcloud images. Image versions and recommended mitigations can be found under the Resolve tab.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
[Important](http://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/) .

All OpenStack systems deployed by the director with these images have the known root passwd of "ROOTPW". If this password was not changed after deployment, an attacker could potentially access and update the system as root.

Because remote root access using SSH is disabled by default, an attacker would require an account on the machine or console access through either the undercloud Compute (this configuration is not supported) or other standard console tools.

To diagnose this vulnerability in your OpenStack environment, see the **Resolve** tab.

## Impacted Products

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Platform 7.0 (Kilo) director
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty) director

## Diagnose

You can easily diagnose this vulnerability doing the following:

1. Run **nova list** on the undercloud to display a list of impacted machines.
2. Try to log on as 'root' to each machine using the 'ROOTPW' password.

## Mitigation

The vulnerability can be mitigated by changing the root password of any machines deployed by the director, or restricting the root account:

1. Run **nova list** on the undercloud to display a list of impacted machines.
2. Log into each machine and gain root access, example:
   * ```
     $ ssh heat-admin@<your-system>
     $ su -

     ```
3. Do one of the following:
   * Set a new password:
   * ```
     # passwd

     ```
   * Lock the root account:
   * ```
     # passwd -l root

     ```

## Updates for Affected Products

Fixes for all impacted Products were released on June 13, 2016.

Errata only provide updated images for future deployments. However, the root password in current deployments must also be updated (see Mitigation).

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
