Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-4474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the image build process for overcloud images used by Red Hat OpenStack director. Specifically, the kickstart configuration for the input image contained `rootpw ROOTPW`, which set a default root password for the resulting images.
- This default password was not changed during the customization process where OpenStack packages were installed on the base image, leading to all shipped images having the same default root password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Default, hardcoded root password ("ROOTPW") present in the overcloud images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  If the default root password was not changed after deployment, an attacker could potentially gain root access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have an account on the affected machine or console access.
- Although remote root login via SSH is disabled by default, an attacker could leverage an existing account, access via the undercloud Compute (which is unsupported), or use other console tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the target system (either through an existing account, console, or other means)
- Knowledge of the default root password "ROOTPW".

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was present in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) director and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty) director
- Patches were released on June 13, 2016 as RHSA-2016:1222 and RHSA-2016:1223
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by changing the root password or locking the root account on deployed machines
