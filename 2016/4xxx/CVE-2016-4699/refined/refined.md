- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple memory corruption issues in AppleUUC were caused by improper input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application could exploit the memory corruption issues to gain kernel privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application.
