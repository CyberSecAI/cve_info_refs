{
  "CVE-2016-4979": {
    "description": "The Apache HTTPD web server (from 2.4.18-2.4.20) did not validate a X509 client certificate correctly when experimental module for the HTTP/2 protocol is used to access a resource. The net result is that a resource that should require a valid client certificate in order to get access can be accessed without that credential.",
    "root_cause": "The mod_ssl module failed to take the (failed/absent) client certificate validation into account when providing access to a resource over HTTP/2.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect client certificate validation",
      "Bypass of access control restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to resources, potential disclosure of information",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network request",
	  "HTTP/2 protocol"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests over HTTP/2, including a second request after the connection is established",
	 "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered if mod_http2 is loaded, h2 or h2c are activated, and the browser uses the HTTP/2 protocol and makes more than one request over the same connection."
