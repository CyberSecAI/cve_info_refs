Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-4509

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the processing of EPC files in Eaton ELCSoft programming software. Specifically, parsing a specially crafted EPC file can cause the `ELCSoft.exe` process to overwrite a `TList` object in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** The software does not properly validate the size of the data when processing EPC files, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the `ELCSoft.exe` process on the target system. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the system, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious EPC File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted malicious EPC file and trick a user into opening it.
- **Remote exploitation:** The advisory indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. This implies that an attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability through a malicious page or file over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Skill Attacker:** According to the ICS-CERT advisory, an attacker with low skill can exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file, according to the ZDI advisory. However, the ICS-CERT advisory indicates it can be exploited remotely.
- **Access to the Target System:** The attacker needs a way to get the crafted EPC file to the target user or have a means to cause the application to process a malicious file remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects versions of ELCSoft Version 2.4.01 and earlier.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['24488'].
- Eaton has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
-  The CVSS v3 base score for this CVE is 6.0 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L. The CVSS v2 base score is 6.8 with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P.
