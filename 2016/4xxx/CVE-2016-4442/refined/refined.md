Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `rack-mini-profiler` handled requests, specifically in how it exposed internal information about strings and objects allocated during a request. This information could be accessed by unauthorized users if requests were crafted maliciously. The core issue was that the profiler was not doing proper authorization checks prior to collecting data, and the data collection process could potentially leak sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of internal application data, including potentially sensitive strings and objects, to unauthorized users.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The vulnerability was caused by a lack of sufficient authorization checks before processing and exposing the collected profiling information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to potentially sensitive internal application data which could be used to understand the inner workings of the system, or even for direct data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the application. The exact nature of these "carefully crafted requests" is not detailed in the provided information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need to have network access to the application where `rack-mini-profiler` is running.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and potentially manipulate headers/query strings.
*   **No authentication required**: The attacker does not need to be logged in or be a known user of the application.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.10 of the `rack-mini-profiler` gem by implementing security checks earlier in the request pipeline. This change ensures that no profiling data is collected or exposed unless the request is authorized. The fix also involves introducing an authorization token that is cycled after 30 minutes and performing the check on each request.

**Additional Notes:**

* The fix specifically addresses a scenario in production environments where unauthorized users might be able to trigger profiling.
* The commit `4273771d65f1a7411e3ef5843329308d0e2d257c` contains the code changes which implement the fix.
* The vulnerability was announced on the oss-security mailing list, where the fix was also publicly announced.
