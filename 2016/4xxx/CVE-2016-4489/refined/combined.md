> 1) Exploitable Buffer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

As far as we can tell, you sent a CVE request for this vulnerability
to cve-assign@...re.org (from a different email address of yours) on
2016-02-05, and we replied with a CVE ID on 2016-02-06. Is there an
additional aspect of 69687 that you are reporting now?

Our reply at that time was:

  > <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

  >> Since n is a signed int, n wraps over at some iteration. Since,
  >> realloc expects n to be unsigned, we end up allocating less memory
  >> then actually needed. In the beginning though n is too large and
  >> xrealloc simply complains. However, if you play a bit with the length
  >> of arg, you'll quickly turn that integer overflow in a buffer
  >> overflow.

  Use CVE-2016-2226 for this incorrect handling of a signed int.

> 2) Invalid Write due to a Use-After-Free (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70481>

Comment 2 says "two distinct bugs."

Use CVE-2016-4487 for the btypevec bug.

Use CVE-2016-4488 for the ktypevec bug.

> 3) Invalid Write due to Integer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70492>

Use CVE-2016-4489.

> 4) Write Access Violation (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70498>

Use CVE-2016-4490 for this issue described as "Root cause: In
cp-demangle.c sometimes length-variables are of type long ... Other
times they are of type int."

Note that this CVE ID is not about the Comment 1 "case where
consume_count returns -1" -- that comment does not belong in 70498 at
all.

> 5) Various Stack Corruptions (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70909>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00105>

Use CVE-2016-4491 for this issue caused by a lack of checking for "has
itself as ancestor more than once."

> 6) Write Access Violation (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70926>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00223>

Use CVE-2016-4492 for both of the "first read the value of a length
variable len from the mangled string, then strncpy len characters from
the mangled string; more than necessary" issues.

Use CVE-2016-4493 for both of the "read the value of an array index n
from the mangled string, which can be negative due to an overflow"
issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=70498#c0)  Marcel Böhme    2016-04-01 10:09:01 UTC  ``` Due to the inconsistent use of long and int for string/array length in cp-demangle.c there is an integer overflow that leads to a write access violation. The target crashes on an access violation at an address matching the destination operand of the instruction.  This error was found during fuzzing with a more efficient version of AFL.  How to reproduce: $ valgrind c++filt _Z80800000000000000000000 ==87985== Invalid read of size 1 ==87985==    at 0x7C3DFC: d_unqualified_name (cp-demangle.c:1555) ==87985==    by 0x7CA9DF: d_name (cp-demangle.c:1399) ==87985==    by 0x7CC1A3: d_encoding (cp-demangle.c:1257) ==87985==    by 0x7D153C: cplus_demangle_mangled_name (cp-demangle.c:1172) ==87985==    by 0x7D153C: d_demangle_callback (cp-demangle.c:5894) ==87985==    by 0x7D153C: d_demangle (cp-demangle.c:5945) ==87985==    by 0x7D153C: cplus_demangle_v3 (cp-demangle.c:6102) ==87985==    by 0x75AB53: cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:865) .. Segmentation fault  Root cause: In cp-demangle.c sometimes length-variables are of type long, e.g., when the length of an identifier is parsed in d_number. Other times they are of type int, e.g., when actually parsing an identifier in d_identifier. Note that cp-demangle.h exports structs and methods with length-variables of type int.  Preparing a patch. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=70498#c1)  Bernd Schmidt    2016-04-08 12:07:31 UTC  ``` Author: bernds Date: Fri Apr  8 12:06:59 2016 New Revision: 234828  URL: <https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?rev=234828&root=gcc&view=rev> Log: Handle an overflow case ([PR70498](show_bug.cgi?id=70498 "RESOLVED FIXED - Libiberty Demangler segfaults (3)"), patch by Marcel Böhme).
