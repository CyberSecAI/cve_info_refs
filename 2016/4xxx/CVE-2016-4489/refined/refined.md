Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the demangling process of virtual tables in the `gnu_special` function within `cplus-dem.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Integer overflow: The vulnerability arises from an integer overflow when calculating the length of a virtual table qualifier. The `consume_count` function, when encountering a long length value in the mangled string, can return -1 after an overflow. This -1 value is then used without proper validation within `string_appendn`.
*   Invalid memory access: The negative value is used in a memcpy operation within the `string_appendn` function which leads to an invalid memory write and read of size 8 and eventually a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash (Segmentation Fault):** The primary impact is a crash of the application using the libiberty demangler due to an invalid memory write or read.
*   **Potential Denial-of-Service:** Repeated crashes could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Mangled Name Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted mangled name as input to the demangler function, specifically one with a large virtual table qualifier.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted mangled names to the demangler, typically through the application that utilizes the libiberty library. No special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
* The inconsistent use of `long` and `int` for string/array lengths within `cp-demangle.c` contributed to this overflow. Length variables were parsed as `long` and then used as `int` leading to potential overflows when used in memory operations.
* The vulnerability is located in the `gnu_special` function in `cplus-dem.c` file.
* The vulnerability was found during fuzzing with a more efficient version of AFL.
* The fix was to handle the case when `consume_count` returns -1, as well as parsing numbers as integer instead of long to avoid overflow after sanity checks.
