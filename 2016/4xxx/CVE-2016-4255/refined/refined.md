Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `FlateDecode` functionality of Adobe Reader DC. Specifically, a specially crafted PDF with a specific `FlateDecode` stream can trigger a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** A dangling pointer is accessed and reused after the memory it points to has been freed. This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running Adobe Reader). This could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF document.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, such as opening the malicious PDF file, or visiting a malicious page that loads the malicious PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the malicious PDF can be distributed via email, web downloads, or other methods.
- **Ability to craft malicious PDF:** Attackers must be able to create a malicious PDF file that contains a specific `FlateDecode` stream designed to trigger the vulnerability.
