Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an infinite or very deep recursion in the `dissect_ber_constrained_octet_string` function within the ASN.1 BER dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite/Deep Recursion:** The vulnerable function can enter an infinite or very deep recursion loop when processing a malformed ASN.1 BER packet. This is due to improper handling of specific malformed octet strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the Wireshark application due to the excessive recursion.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated crashes can lead to a denial of service scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed packet onto the network.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker could craft a malicious packet capture file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to either inject packets on the network or to send the victim a malicious capture file. No specific authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
- It affects Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.1 and 1.12.0 to 1.12.9.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark versions 2.0.2 and 1.12.10.
- The bug report also includes a `ber-overflow.pcap` file, which can be used as a reproducer.
- The issue is also tracked as `wnpa-sec-2016-18`.
