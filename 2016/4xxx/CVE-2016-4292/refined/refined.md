The content is related to CVE-2016-4292.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow in Hancom Hangul Office HShow application. When processing a .hpt document, the application allocates a fixed size heap buffer (0xa0 bytes), but later trusts a size read from the file when writing data into the buffer. This discrepancy allows an attacker to write data outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap buffer overflow: The application allocates a buffer of 0xa0 bytes but uses a 16-bit value from the file to control the number of iterations in a loop which writes to this buffer, potentially writing past the allocated memory.
    - Insufficient bounds checking: The application does not properly validate the size value read from the file against the allocated buffer size before writing data.
    - Trust of user-controlled size: The application trusts a user controlled 16-bit value to determine the number of loop iterations leading to out-of-bounds writes.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can corrupt memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer, leading to code execution under the context of the application.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted .hpt file. The attacker needs to create a malicious .hpt document that contains a specific structure with a 16-bit value that, when used, will cause an out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption and potentially code execution.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to create a malicious .hpt file.
    - The attacker must be able to get a target to open the malicious .hpt file with the vulnerable version of Hancom Hangul Office HShow application.
