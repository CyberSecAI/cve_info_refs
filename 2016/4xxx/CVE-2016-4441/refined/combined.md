## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH 2/2] scsi: check dma length before reading scsi comm

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PATCH 2/2] scsi: check dma length before reading scsi command(CVE-2016-4441) |
| **Date**: | Thu, 19 May 2016 16:09:31 +0530 |

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

The 53C9X Fast SCSI Controller(FSC) comes with an internal 16-byte
FIFO buffer. It is used to handle command and data transfer.
Routine get_cmd() uses DMA to read scsi commands into this buffer.
Add check to validate DMA length against buffer size to avoid any
overrun.

Fixes CVE-2016-4441
Reported-by: Li Qiang <address@hidden>

 in get_cmd

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the ESP/NCR53C9x controller emulation support
is vulnerable to an OOB write access issue. The controller uses 16-byte FIFO
buffer for command and data transfer. The OOB write occurs while writing to
this command buffer in routine get_cmd().

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
resulting in DoS.

# USN-3047-2: QEMU regression

12 August 2016

USN-3047-1 introduced a regression in QEMU.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [qemu](/security/cves?package=qemu) - Machine emulator and virtualizer
* [qemu-kvm](/security/cves?package=qemu-kvm) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

USN-3047-1 fixed vulnerabilities in QEMU. The patch to fix [CVE-2016-5403](/security/CVE-2016-5403)

caused a regression which resulted in save/restore failures when virtio

memory balloon statistics are enabled. This update temporarily reverts the

security fix for [CVE-2016-5403](/security/CVE-2016-5403) pending further investigation. We apologize

for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled 53C9X Fast SCSI

controller emulation. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this

issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU

is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor

profile. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-4439](/security/CVE-2016-4439), [CVE-2016-4441](/security/CVE-2016-4441), [CVE-2016-5238](/security/CVE-2016-5238), [CVE-2016-5338](/security/CVE-2016-5338), [CVE-2016-6351](/security/CVE-2016-6351))

Li Qiang and Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the

VMWare VGA module. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this

issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

to obtain sensitive host memory. ([CVE-2016-4453](/security/CVE-2016-4453), [CVE-2016-4454](/security/CVE-2016-4454))

Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled VMWARE PVSCSI paravirtual

SCSI bus emulation support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could

use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-4952](/security/CVE-2016-4952))

Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host

Bus Adapter emulation support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could

use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly to obtain sensitive host memory. This issue only applied to Ubuntu

14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-5105](/security/CVE-2016-5105), [CVE-2016-5106](/security/CVE-2016-5106),

[CVE-2016-5107](/security/CVE-2016-5107), [CVE-2016-5337](/security/CVE-2016-5337))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain iSCSI asynchronous

I/O ioctl calls. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause

QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used

with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.

This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-5126](/security/CVE-2016-5126))

Zhenhao Hong discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Virtio module. A

privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-5403](/security/CVE-2016-5403))

    Daniel Shapira reported several integer overflows in the packet
    handling in ethernet controllers emulated by QEMU. These issues could
    lead to denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

* [qemu-kvm](/security/cves?package=qemu-kvm) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled 53C9X Fast SCSI

controller emulation. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this

issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU

is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor

profile. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-4439](/security/CVE-2016-4439), [CVE-2016-4441](/security/CVE-2016-4441), [CVE-2016-5238](/security/CVE-2016-5238), [CVE-2016-5338](/security/CVE-2016-5338), [CVE-2016-6351](/security/CVE-2016-6351))

Li Qiang and Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the

VMWare VGA module. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this

issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

to obtain sensitive host memory. ([CVE-2016-4453](/security/CVE-2016-4453), [CVE-2016-4454](/security/CVE-2016-4454))

Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled VMWARE PVSCSI paravirtual

SCSI bus emulation support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could

use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-4952](/security/CVE-2016-4952))

Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host

Bus Adapter emulation support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could

use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly to obtain sensitive host memory. This issue only applied to Ubuntu

14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-5105](/security/CVE-2016-5105), [CVE-2016-5106](/security/CVE-2016-5106),

[CVE-2016-5107](/security/CVE-2016-5107), [CVE-2016-5337](/security/CVE-2016-5337))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain iSCSI asynchronous

I/O ioctl calls. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause

QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used

with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.

This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-5126](/security/CVE-2016-5126))

Zhenhao Hong discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Virtio module. A

privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-5403](/security/CVE-2016-5403))
