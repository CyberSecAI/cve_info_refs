Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4631:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `ImageIO` API, specifically in the parsing and handling of Tiled TIFF images.
- A crafted TIFF image file with a non-standard tile width can cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect calculations of buffer size, where the allocated buffer is smaller than the data being written.
- The code defaults to smaller image dimensions for buffer allocation, but uses the original tile dimensions when reading and writing image data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The code allocates a buffer on the heap based on the image dimensions but proceeds to write data based on the tile dimensions which leads to writing outside of the allocated buffer's bounds.
- **Inadequate size check:** The code incorrectly calculates the buffer size, failing to accommodate cases where the tile width exceeds the image width.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote code execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Memory corruption:** The heap overflow corrupts memory, potentially leading to crashes and unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious web page:** The vulnerability can be triggered by visiting a malicious web page that includes a crafted TIFF image.
- **MMS message:** A specially crafted TIFF image could be sent via MMS message.
- **iMessage:**  The vulnerability can be exploited through iMessage.
- **File attachment:** A crafted TIFF file could be delivered through other means and exploited when opened in applications using the Apple Image I/O API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted TIFF file to the target. This could be achieved through a website, message, or file attachment.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
- The user needs to open the malicious TIFF image in an application that uses the vulnerable Apple Image I/O API

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `libTIFF.dylib` library.
- The vulnerability is triggered when reading tile data from the tiff image.
- The crafted image contains a `tile width` value larger than the image width and the application incorrectly calculates the needed memory based on the smaller image width.
- The `num_samples` value in the tiff image can be controlled allowing an attacker to easily cause memory corruption.

The provided information gives detailed insight into the root cause, the vulnerable code sections, and the exploitation process, making it more detailed than the typical CVE description.
