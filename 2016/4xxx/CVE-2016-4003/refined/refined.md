Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a broken URLDecoder implementation in older JRE versions (specifically identified as an issue with JRE 1.5), which fails to properly reject/filter non-specification compliant URL-encoded parameter values that include multi-byte characters when using a single byte page encoding like ISO-8895-1. Struts 2's usage of the standard JRE URLDecoder exposed this flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Due to the broken URLDecoder, a malicious actor can inject JavaScript code into URL parameters.  The injected script is not properly sanitized when the  `<s:textfield>` tag is used, allowing it to be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying page content.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through maliciously crafted URL parameters. An attacker crafts a URL with a parameter value that includes encoded multi-byte characters. The specific example URL provided: `http://localhost:8080/sample.action?myinput=%fc%80%80%80%80%a2%fc%80%80%80%80%bE%FC%80%80%80%80%BC%FC%80%80%80%81%B7%FC%80%80%80%81%A8%FC%80%80%80%81%B3%FC%80%80%80%81%A3%FC%80%80%80%81%A8%FC%80%80%80%81%A5%FC%80%80%80%81%A3%FC%80%80%80%81%AB%FC%80%80%80%80%BE%fc%80%80%80%80%bCscript%fc%80%80%80%80%bEalert%fc%80%80%80%80%a81%fc%80%80%80%80%a9%fc%80%80%80%80%bC%fc%80%80%80%80%aFscript%fc%80%80%80%80%bE` shows how a script can be injected through `myinput` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a page with a `<s:textfield name="myinput" id="myinput"></s:textfield>` tag is loaded with the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and have them accessed by a user.
*   The attacker doesn't require any special privileges on the server, merely the ability to influence the URL that is requested by a victim user.
*   The target application must use Struts 2 and be running on a vulnerable JRE version (e.g., JRE 1.5). The application must also be configured to use a single-byte encoding like ISO-8895-1.
*   The application must use the vulnerable Struts tag `<s:textfield>`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported by WhiteHat Security.
*   The vulnerability affects Struts versions 2.0.0 through 2.3.24.1.
*   The fix is in Struts 2.3.28, which includes a safer URLDecoder implementation, and in later versions.
*   Upgrading the JRE to a recent version (preferably 1.8 or later) also resolves the issue.
*   A workaround is to use UTF-8 for page and parameter encoding.
