- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `CSSValFormat::CheckUnderbar` function of Hancom Hangul HCell. The function incorrectly calculates the length of a string and writes a null terminator outside of the allocated buffer. Specifically, if a string ends with an underscore character ('\_'), the function attempts to write a null terminator one byte beyond the allocated buffer for the string.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap out-of-bounds write: The application writes a null byte outside the allocated buffer.
    - Improper bounds checking: The application does not properly validate the boundaries when writing the null terminator after an underscore character.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to heap corruption, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted Hangul Hcell document (.cell file). The malicious document must contain a record of type `0x041e` with a format string that ends with an underscore character. The `CSSValFormat::CheckUnderbar` function is called when parsing this record, triggering the out-of-bounds write when processing the underscore.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .cell file and have a user open this file using a vulnerable version of Hancom Hangul Hcell.
