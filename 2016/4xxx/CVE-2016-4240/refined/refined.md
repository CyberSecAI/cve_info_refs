    "content": "The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player, including CVE-2016-4240, which is a memory corruption issue. The content indicates that this vulnerability, along with others, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors. The root cause is memory corruption. These vulnerabilities are present in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.366 and 19.x through 22.x before 22.0.0.209 on Windows and OS X, and before 11.2.202.632 on Linux. The impact of successful exploitation is arbitrary code execution or a denial of service. The attack vector is network-based, requiring the user to interact with malicious Flash content, meaning user interaction is required. The attacker's capabilities are that they must be able to deliver specially crafted Flash content. The content also notes that the severity is considered \"important\". SUSE assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8, while the National Vulnerability Database assigned 9.3. Red Hat also issued a security advisory (RHSA-2016:1423) to address the vulnerabilities.",
