Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Schedule" function of Cybozu Office, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the "Schedule" function, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious script code through the "Schedule" function of Cybozu Office.
- The injected script is executed when a user views the manipulated schedule data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the affected application.
- **Low privileges required:** The attacker needs only low privileges to inject the malicious script.
- **User interaction required:** The victim user must interact with the malicious data (view the manipulated schedule).
