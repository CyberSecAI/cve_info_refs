  "CVE-2016-4650": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the IOHIDFamily kernel extension. The issue lies in the failure to validate a supplied length value causing a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code under the context of the kernel.",
    "root_cause": "Failure to validate a supplied length value.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
