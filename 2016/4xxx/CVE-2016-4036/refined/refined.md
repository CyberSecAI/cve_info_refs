Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-4036:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the configuration files located in `/etc/quagga` were world-readable. These configuration files contain sensitive information, including passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file permissions (world-readable) on configuration files containing sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read the configuration files, gaining access to sensitive information, including passwords used to access the Quagga routing daemon. This would compromise the confidentiality of the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local attacker with access to the system could read the configuration files directly due to the world-readable permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where Quagga is running to be able to read the files in `/etc/quagga`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in multiple openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise versions.
*   The fix involved changing the file permissions to be more restrictive.
*   The bug report mentions that the issue was present across all versions the reporter was aware of, including SLES 11 SP1.
*   The fix was implemented by Pawel Wieczorkiewicz.
*   The vulnerability was also addressed in Debian as DSA-3654-1.
