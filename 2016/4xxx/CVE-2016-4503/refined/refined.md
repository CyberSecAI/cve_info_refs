- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass that occurs when an attacker is able to identify an authenticated UserId from a parameter passed in a cookie.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is an authorization bypass vulnerability (CWE-639) that allows unauthorized access by manipulating a user-controlled key (UserId in a cookie).

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to change settings and data on the affected Moxa device. This could lead to unauthorized modification of device configurations and data manipulation, potentially disrupting operations.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network access to the web console.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to identify a valid authenticated UserId from a cookie parameter. Low technical skill is required to exploit the vulnerability.
