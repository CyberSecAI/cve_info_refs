```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The authd rpm creates the /etc/ident.key file with insecure permissions during the rpm postinstall script. The file is created using openssl, then appended with "CHANGE THE LINE ABOVE TO A PASSPHRASE", then the ownership is changed to ident:ident, and finally permissions are set to o-rw. There is a race condition where the file contents could be exposed between creation and chmod. Additionally, the key is generated at install time and not during first run, so all container/image instances would share the same key.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Insecure file creation due to race condition between file creation and setting secure permissions, leading to potential exposure of file contents.
  - Insecure key generation strategy, where the same key is used across multiple instances, rather than generating a unique key per instance.

- Impact of exploitation:
  - Potential exposure of the /etc/ident.key file's contents if the file is read between its creation and the chmod command execution. This exposed key could potentially be used in further attacks.
  - Sharing of the same key across instances makes it easier for an attacker to compromise multiple systems.

- Attack vectors:
  - Local access during the RPM installation process, specifically the time window between file creation and permission setting.
  - If the /etc/ident.key file is exposed due to insecure permissions, it can be used to compromise systems using authd.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - An attacker would need to have local access to the system during the RPM postinstall phase to exploit the race condition.
  - The attacker would need to be able to read the created /etc/ident.key file prior to the chmod o-rw call to exfiltrate the key.
