{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the handling of EXR images due to a sign extension issue when calculating the destination buffer pointer (toPtr). The xStride and yStride values are user-controlled, and if they are signed, the calculation sign extends, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation",
      "Integer sign extension"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code by opening a maliciously crafted EXR image file in any application using the Apple Image I/O API. The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service due to the crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted EXR image file",
      "Opening the image through the Apple Image I/O API"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted EXR image file with specific parameters that cause the sign extension and out-of-bounds write. They need to deliver this file to the target system and trick a user to open the file."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "affected_versions": "OSX El Capitan - 10.11.4",
      "vulnerable_code_details": "The vulnerability lies in the `Imf_2_2::InputFile::readPixels` function of the `libOpenEXR.dylib` library. The calculation of the `toPtr` involves multiplication with user-controlled `xStride` and `yStride` values, which are not correctly validated for negative values causing sign extension.",
   "fix_details": "The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring proper sanitation and bounds checking of the xStride and yStride values."
