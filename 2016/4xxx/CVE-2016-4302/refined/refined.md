{
  "CVE-2016-4302": {
    "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the parse_codes function in archive_read_support_format_rar.c in libarchive before 3.2.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a RAR file with a zero-sized dictionary.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the rar decompression functionality where a zero-sized dictionary is not properly rejected, leading to a zero-sized memory allocation and subsequent heap corruption during dictionary initialization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code due to heap corruption.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted RAR file to a system using a vulnerable version of libarchive.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker only needs to be able to send or make the target open the malformed RAR file. No special privileges or user interaction are required, although some form of user interaction is required to open the file."
