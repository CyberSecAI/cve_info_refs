  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "Forced double OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag attributes, may lead to remote code execution (similar to S2-029)",
    "affected_products": [
      "Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.3.28.1",
	  "NetApp OnCommand Balance"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Apache Struts frameworks when forced, performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags so it is possible to pass in a value that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes will be rendered.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Forced double OGNL evaluation on raw user input in tag attributes"

    "impact": "Possible Remote Code Execution vulnerability",

      "Passing in a value that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes will be rendered",

  "recommendations": [
    "Always validate incoming parameters' values when re-assigning them to certain Struts' tags attributes.",
    "Don't use %{...} syntax in tag attributes other than *value* unless you have a valid use-case.",
    "Alternatively upgrade to Struts 2.3.29 or Struts 2.5.1" ,
	"NetApp OnCommand Balance has no plans to address this vulnerability. See the EOA announcement for more information."
