Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-4991:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `NodePDF` library uses `child_process.exec()` to render PDFs, passing user-controlled input as part of the command.
*   The shell escaping mechanism used by `NodePDF` was insufficient and did not properly encode all special characters, specifically semicolons (`;`) and curly braces (`{}`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the command executed by `child_process.exec()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting shell commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the `NodePDF` application with the privileges of the user running the Node.js process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by controlling the input passed to the `NodePDF` constructor or `render()` function, specifically the URL/content and output filename parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to provide input to the `NodePDF` library, typically through a web application or service that uses the library.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was later fixed in the `shell-escape` library and assigned CVE-2016-10541.
*   The provided example code demonstrates how to inject commands using a URL containing malicious characters.
*   The example shows that injecting `;{echo,hello,world};w` into the URL results in the execution of the command `echo hello world` in the context of the Node.js process.
