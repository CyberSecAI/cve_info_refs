- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into a specially crafted URL. This injected script can then be executed in the victim's browser when they access the response containing user data, potentially leading to malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted URL request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit this vulnerability with low skill level. The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URL requests to the vulnerable device.
