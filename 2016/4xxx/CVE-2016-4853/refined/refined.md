Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in how multiple AKABEi SOFT2 LTD. games load saved data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The games are susceptible to OS command injection due to the insecure handling of saved game data.

- The attacker needs to entice the victim to load the crafted save file.
- No special privileges are needed to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vendor's statement has a list of all affected games
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.8 (High) with attack vector being Local. CVSS v2 score is 6.8 (Medium) with attack vector being Network
- A workaround is to not load save files from untrusted sources.
