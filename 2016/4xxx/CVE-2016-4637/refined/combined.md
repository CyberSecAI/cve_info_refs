### TALOS-2016-0186

## Apple Core Graphics BMP Framework img\_decode\_read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 18, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-4637

### SUMMARY

An exploitable out of bounds write exists in the handling of BMP images on Apple OS X and iOS. A crafted BMP document can lead to an out of bounds write resulting in remote code execution. Vulnerability can be triggered via a saved BMP file delivered by other means when opened in any application using the Apple Core Graphics API.

### TESTED VERSIONS

OS X El Capitan - 10.11.5

### PRODUCT URLs

https://developer.apple.com/osx/download

### CVSSv3 SCORE

6.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### DETAILS

This vulnerability is present in the Apple CoreGraphics framework which is used for path-based drawing, transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients and shadings, image data management, image creation, masking, and PDF document creation, display, and parsing on OS X and iOS.

There exists a vulnerability in the parsing and handling of BMP images. A specially crafted BMP image file can lead to an out of bounds write and ultimately to remote code execution.

The BMP file format, also known as bitmap image file or device independent bitmap file format or simply a bitmap, is a raster graphics image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device (such as a graphics adapter), especially on Microsoft Windows. BMP handles multiple different forms of compression as well making it a somewhat difficult graphics format to parse.

A dump of the files relevant header components is shown below:

```
<class bmp.BITMAPINFOHEADER> 'bmiHeader'
[e] <instance bmp.DWORD 'biSize'> 0x00000028 (40)
[12] <instance bmp.LONG 'biWidth'> 0x0000e803 (59395)
[16] <instance bmp.LONG 'biHeight'> 0x0000ff01 (65281)
[1a] <instance bmp.WORD 'biPlanes'> 0x0001 (1)
[1c] <instance bmp.WORD 'biBitCount'> 0x0004 (4)
[1e] <instance bmp.__biCompression 'biCompression'> BI_RLE4(0x2)
[22] <instance bmp.DWORD 'biSizeImage'> 0x00000200 (512)
[26] <instance bmp.LONG 'biXPelsPerMeter'> 0x00000b12 (2834)
[2a] <instance bmp.LONG 'biYPelsPerMeter'> 0x00000b12 (2834)
[2e] <instance bmp.DWORD 'biClrUsed'> 0x00000010 (16)
[32] <instance bmp.DWORD 'biClrImportant'> 0x00000010 (16)
```

```

And running the file through Qlmanage with guard malloc enabled shows us this crash:

```
```

```

This function is used in a loop to continually grab more data from the image with an increasing value passed in via RSI (at [0]) until it reaches the image height value. When the value grows large enough a sign extension error occurs. In this case it is 0xff00 that causes the problem. A pointer to a valid image data buffer (at [1]) is returned and then some indexing is done on it to get to the proper element. The problem arises because the image height is not properly checked so when the value in R14 is promoted to a larger type stored in RCX the remaining bits gets filled in with 0xF causing an invalid index into the array. As shown previously the invalid index is calculated via the image height allowing this vulnerability to potentially be leveraged into an information leak or full remote code execution.
