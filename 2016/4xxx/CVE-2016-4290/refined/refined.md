- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow during size calculation for a heap buffer allocation, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the application adds a constant (0x16) to a value read from the file without checking if the addition causes an integer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to unchecked integer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution under the context of the application, by overwriting contiguous heap data.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) file. The malicious file contains a specific structure that triggers the vulnerability during processing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious .hpt file and have the victim open it using a vulnerable version of the Hangul HShow application.
