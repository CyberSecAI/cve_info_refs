Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-4073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2016-4073 lies in the `mb_strcut()` function within the PHP mbstring extension. This function incorrectly calculates string lengths when processing multi-byte strings, potentially leading to a negative size parameter being passed to `memcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect String Length Calculation:** The core vulnerability lies in how `mb_strcut()` calculates the length of the substring to be extracted from a multi-byte string.
*   **Negative Size Parameter:** Due to the incorrect length calculation, a negative size parameter can be passed to the `memcpy` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition caused by a crash due to the negative size parameter in `memcpy`, leading to a segmentation fault.
*  **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The description also mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution, although this is less definitive. A negative size parameter passed to `memcpy` can cause a heap-based buffer overflow, which could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Input Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the input string and the length parameters passed to the `mb_strcut()` function to trigger the negative size parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger `mb_strcut()`:**  The attacker needs to be able to pass data to a PHP application that is processed by the vulnerable `mb_strcut()` function. This is commonly done via user-supplied data like query string parameters.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker without authentication.

**Additional Details from the Analysis:**

*   The vulnerability affects PHP versions before 5.5.34, 5.6.x before 5.6.20, and 7.x before 7.0.5.
*   The vulnerability was discovered due to Address Sanitizer detecting a negative-size-param in `mbfl_strcut`.
*   A test case demonstrates a segmentation fault when `mb_strcut()` is called with a specific combination of start position and length values.
*   The fix involves modifying the length calculation within `mbfl_strcut` to ensure that the size passed to `memcpy` is never negative.
*   Multiple vendors such as SUSE, Debian and Ubuntu have released patches to address this issue.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is rated as medium by SUSE.
*   SUSE has made the patch available for multiple products including SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop, and SUSE Manager.
*   OpenSUSE has also released an update to address the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2016-4073 arises from a flaw in the `mb_strcut()` function that can be triggered by a remote attacker via manipulated input, leading to a denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution. The fix involves correctly calculating string length before passing it to the `memcpy` function.
