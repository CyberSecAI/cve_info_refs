The provided content is related to CVE-2016-4351.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input prior to executing a SQL statement within the authentication functionality of Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Bypass authentication mechanisms.
- Execute arbitrary code within the context of the database.
- Potentially gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway. No prior authentication is needed.
