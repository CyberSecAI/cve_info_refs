# ASF Project Security for Committers[¶](#asf-project-security-for-committers "Permalink")

## Introduction[¶](#introduction "Permalink")

Here is guidance for Apache committers on how to handle
security vulnerabilities. The Apache Security
Team is available to provide help and advice
to Apache projects that require it.

* [Known vulnerabilities](#known)
* [Project-specific security mailing lists](#lists)
* [Handling a possible vulnerability](#possible)
* [CVE IDs](#ids)

## Known vulnerabilities[¶](#known "Permanent link")

Projects with known, published vulnerabilities should provide information
about those vulnerabilities on pages such as the
[httpd security pages](https://httpd.apache.org/security_report.html). Provide a clear link on the project's home page to the
security information.

Do not enter details of security vulnerabilities in a project's public bug
tracker unless the necessary configuration is in place to limit access to
the issue to only the reporter and the project team.

## Project-specific security mailing lists[¶](#lists "Permanent link")

Projects may wish to create a [project-specific security mailing list](https://security.apache.org/projects/).
These take the name in the form `security@project.apache.org`, like
`security@tomcat.apache.org`.

When the infrastructure team creates project-specific security mailing lists, they configure them to copy
all messages to `security@apache.org` automatically, so you do not have to
cc `security@apache.org` when sending mail to such a list.

We expect that a subset of project PMC members and committers will
subscribe to the project-specific security mailing list. Do not use the list as a third-party notification system; non-committers should not
be subscribed to the list.

## Handling a possible vulnerability[¶](#possible "Permanent link")

Here is the default process for handling a possible security vulnerability.
Projects that need a different process **must** contact security@apache.org for advice,
and should expect to clearly and publicly document their process.

### Work in private[¶](#work-in-private "Permalink")

Do **not** make information about the vulnerability public until it is formally announced at the end of this process. That means, for example, that you should **not** create a public Jira ticket to track the issue, or a public GitHub issue, since those would make the issue public.
Messages associated with any commits should **not** make any reference to the
security nature of the commit.

### Report[¶](#report "Permalink")

1. The person discovering the issue, the *reporter*, identifies the mailing list to report to.
   If the project the issue relates to has a security@*[project]*.apache.org mailing list listed on
   [security projects list](https://security.apache.org/projects/), use that mailing list. Otherwise, use `security@apache.org`.
2. Note that the Security teams will ignore all messages that do not relate to reporting or managing an
   undisclosed security vulnerability in Apache software.
3. If the report comes to `security@apache.org`, the security team forwards
   it to the project's security list or, if the project does not
   have a security list, to the project's private (PMC) mailing list.
   The Security Team responds to the original reporter that they have done this.

If the project does not have a dedicated `security@project.apache.org`
mailing list, all further communication regarding the vulnerability should be copied to `security@apache.org`.
There is no need to do this for messages sent to `security@project.apache.org` since these are automatically copied to `security@apache.org`.

### Acknowledge[¶](#acknowledge "Permalink")

4. The project team sends an e-mail to the original reporter to acknowledge the report, with a copy to the relevant security mailing list.
5. The project team investigates the report and either rejects or accepts it. Project team members may share information about the vulnerability
   with domain experts (including colleagues at their employer) at the discretion of the project's security team, providing that they make clear
   that the information is not for public disclosure.
6. If the project team **rejects** the report, the team writes to the reporter to
   explain why, with a copy to the relevant security mailing list.
7. If the project team **accepts** the report, the team writes to the reporter to let them
   know that they have accepted the report and that they are working on a fix.
8. The project team requests a CVE ([Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/)) ID from the internal portal, `https://cveprocess.apache.org`; or by
   sending an e-mail with the subject "CVE request for..." to `security@apache.org`, providing a
   short (one-line) description of the vulnerability. `security@apache.org` can
   help determine if a report requires multiple CVE IDs or if multiple reports
   should be merged under a single CVE ID.
9. The ASF security team allocates a CVE ID and sends to the project team a link to the
   internal portal where it can enter details of the
   vulnerability.

### Resolve[¶](#resolve "Permalink")

10. The project team agrees on a fix on their private list.
11. The project team documents the details of the vulnerability and the fix on the
    internal portal. The portal generates draft announcement texts. For
    an example of an announcement see [Tomcat's announcement of
    CVE-2008-2370](https://lists.apache.org/thread/smbdmck5m48rbh6tw9bbfszf64oh591y). The
    level of detail to include in the report is a matter of
    judgement. Generally, reports should contain enough information to
    enable people to assess the risk the vulnerability poses for
    their own system, and no more. Announcements do not normally include steps to reproduce the vulnerability.

    Optionally, you can put the CVE into the `REVIEW` state to request a
    review from the Security team. You can discuss the disclosure
    using the 'comment' feature, which also sends the comments to the
    relevant private mailing list(s).
12. The project team provides the reporter with a copy of the fix and the
    draft vulnerability announcement for comment.
13. The project team agrees on the fix, the announcement, and the
    release schedule with the reporter. If the reporter is unresponsive
    in a reasonable timeframe this should not block the project team from
    moving to the next steps, particularly if an issue is of high severity
    or impact.
14. The project team commits the fix. Do **not** make any reference that the commit relates to a security vulnerability.
15. The project team creates a release that includes the fix.

### Announce[¶](#announce "Permalink")

16. After (or at the same time as) the release announcement, the project team announces the vulnerability and the fix.
    Set the CVE status to `READY` in the [internal portal](https://cveprocess.apache.org). You can then use the portal to send the emails.
    The vulnerability announcement should be sent to the following destinations:

    a. the same destinations as the release announcement

    b. the vulnerability reporter

    c. the project's security list (or `security@apache.org` if the project does
    not have a dedicated security list)

    d. `oss-security@lists.openwall.com` ([subscription not required](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists)).

This is the first point that any information regarding the vulnerability is made public.

### Complete[¶](#complete "Permalink")

17. The project team updates the project's security pages.
18. Add the link to the public announcement on the mailinglist as a 'reference' in the CVE.
    This notifies the security team, which will submit the information to the CVE project.
19. If the project repository is in Subversion, add the CVE ID to the log for the commit that applied the fix. Do **not** try to do this if your project uses a Git repository, as editing a pushed commit causes all sorts of problems.

## CVE IDs[¶](#ids "Permanent link")

[CVE](https://cve.org/)
IDs are unique identifiers given to security vulnerabilities. The Apache
Security Team is a [CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/CNAs) covering all Apache projects and is the only
group able to allocate IDs to Apache Software Foundation project issues.

If you believe the details of an issue are described
incorrectly, contact `security@apache.org`.
