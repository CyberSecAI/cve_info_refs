Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-1979:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2016-1979 is a **use-after-free vulnerability** that occurs during the processing of DER encoded keys within the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library. Specifically, the flaw lies within the `PK11_ImportDERPrivateKeyInfoAndReturnKey` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Use-after-Free:** The function `PK11_ImportDERPrivateKeyInfoAndReturnKey` incorrectly assumes that data structures populated by `SEC_ASN1DecodeItem` are valid, even when this function returns a `SECFailure`. If decoding fails, `SECKEY_DestroyPrivateKeyInfo` attempts to operate on already freed data, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted DER-encoded key, causing a crash in the application using the NSS library
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some circumstances, exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user running the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
-   **Crafted DER-encoded keys:** An attacker needs to supply malicious key data with DER encoding.
-   **SSL/TLS handshake:** The use-after-free occurs during the processing of DER-encoded keys, and this function is called during the process of SSL/TLS handshake.
-   **Web content:** Vulnerability can be triggered by viewing a crafted web page (via the firefox browser), and/or other content that utilizes the NSS library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
-   **Ability to send crafted data:** The attacker must be able to send specially crafted DER-encoded key data to the vulnerable application.
-   **User interaction:** Some of the content mentions that the vulnerability requires user interaction to be triggered, as a crafted webpage or mail has to be viewed.

**Additional details from the content:**
* The vulnerability was discovered using Address Sanitizer and software fuzzing.
* The vulnerability was fixed in NSS 3.21.1, and Firefox 45
* The vulnerability may be present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird and other software using the vulnerable NSS library.
* The vulnerability is considered "important" by SUSE and "Moderate" by Red Hat.
* The vulnerability has been addressed in multiple SUSE, Red Hat and Debian security advisories.
* SUSE mentions that the issue is resolved, while Red Hat explicitly states that they backported the fix to certain versions of their products.
