Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1908:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The OpenSSH client did not properly handle situations where untrusted X11 forwarding was requested and generation of the untrusted authentication cookie failed. Specifically, the ssh client continued by generating a fake authentication cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of X11 forwarding failures.
- Failure to properly generate authentication cookies for untrusted X11 forwarding.
- Reliance on the X server's configuration for client connection acceptance, even with the use of a fake cookie

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious or compromised remote X application could establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. This could lead to a remote X client gaining more privileged access to the local X server than intended.
- Bypassing intended shell-command restrictions via X11 forwarding.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker with a malicious X application connecting to an SSH server configured with X11 forwarding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to an SSH server with X11 forwarding enabled and have a malicious X application.
- The target X server must have the SECURITY extension disabled and have authentication methods besides MIT cookies enabled, such as localuser authentication.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the ssh client uses a fake cookie and delegates the client connection decision to the X server.
- The issue was fixed in OpenSSH 7.2.
- When untrusted X11 forwarding is requested and generation of the untrusted authentication cookie fails, the ssh client generates a fake authentication cookie.
- The X server, depending on its configuration, could allow clients to open trusted X connection, granting more privileged access than intended.
- This issue occurs when the X server does not have the X Security extension and has other authentication methods such as localuser enabled (e.g. 'xhost +si:localuser:`id -un`' on Linux)
- On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Fedora versions X servers don't have X Security extension compiled and enable localuser access, making them vulnerable.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, as of RHSA-2013:1620 which released in RHEL 6.5, includes X Security extension and does not fall back to the use of a fake authentication cookie.

**Additional Notes**
-  Some documents mention the issue exists in OpenSSH before 7.1p2 however it was discovered that the issue is actually fixed in version 7.2
