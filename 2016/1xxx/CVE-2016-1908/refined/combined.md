Debian Bug     : 790798 793616 795711 848716 848717

Several vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSH, a free implementation
of the SSH protocol suite:

CVE-2015-5352

    OpenSSH incorrectly verified time window deadlines for X connections.
    Remote attackers could take advantage of this flaw to bypass intended
    access restrictions. Reported by Jann Horn.

CVE-2015-5600

    OpenSSH improperly restricted the processing of keyboard-interactive
    devices within a single connection, which could allow remote attackers
    to perform brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service, in a
    non-default configuration.

CVE-2015-6563

    OpenSSH incorrectly handled usernames during PAM authentication. In
    conjunction with an additional flaw in the OpenSSH unprivileged child
    process, remote attackers could make use if this issue to perform user
    impersonation. Discovered by Moritz Jodeit.

CVE-2015-6564

    Moritz Jodeit discovered a use-after-free flaw in PAM support in
    OpenSSH, that could be used by remote attackers to bypass
    authentication or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2016-1908

    OpenSSH mishandled untrusted X11 forwarding when the X server disables
    the SECURITY extension. Untrusted connections could obtain trusted X11
    forwarding privileges. Reported by Thomas Hoger.

CVE-2016-3115

    OpenSSH improperly handled X11 forwarding data related to
    authentication credentials. Remote authenticated users could make use
    of this flaw to bypass intended shell-command restrictions. Identified
    by github.com/tintinweb.

CVE-2016-6515

    OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication.
    Remote attackers could make use of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service via long strings.

CVE-2016-10009

    Jann Horn discovered an untrusted search path vulnerability in
    ssh-agent allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary local
    PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.

CVE-2016-10011

    Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH did not properly consider the
    effects of realloc on buffer contents. This may allow local users to
    obtain sensitive private-key information by leveraging access to a
    privilege-separated child process.

CVE-2016-10012

    Guido Vranken discovered that the OpenSSH shared memory manager
    did not ensure that a bounds check was enforced by all compilers,
    which could allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging access
    to a sandboxed privilege-separation process.

CVE-2016-10708

    NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash via an out-of-sequence
    NEWKEYS message.

CVE-2017-15906

    Michal Zalewski reported that OpenSSH improperly prevent write
    operations in readonly mode, allowing attackers to create zero-length
    files.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:6.7p1-5+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-14 21:48:58 UTC  ``` It was discovered that OpenSSH client did not correctly handle situations when untrusted X11 forwarding was requested and generation of the untrusted authentication cookie failed.  The ssh client continued by generating fake authentication cookie and allowed remote X clients to connect the local X server.  The decision if client connection was accepted was delegated to the X server which, depending on its configuration, could allow clients to open trusted X connection.  This would lead to remote X clients having more privileged access to the local X server than intended.  This problem can occur when X server does not include or enable X Security extension (for X.org X server, this extension is not compiled in by default since 2007) and when it has authentication methods besides MIT cookies enabled (e.g. localuser authentication allowing all X connections from a local user who owns the X session).  Both of these conditions are satisfied on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and current Fedora versions.  The X server does not have X Security extension compiled in and 'xhost +si:localuser:`id -un`' is run from the xinit scripts.  Therefore remote X clients are granted trusted access to the local X server when 'ssh -X' is used, as if 'ssh -Y' was actually used.  The X server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 includes X Security extension (as of RHSA-2013:1620 - <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1620.html> - which was released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5) and hence does not fall back to the use of fake authentication cookie.  This issue was corrected upstream in version 7.1p2:  <http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.1p2>  Upstream commit:  <https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=ed4ce82dbfa8a3a3c8ea6fa0db113c71e234416c>  which needs to be applied after:  <https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=f98a09cacff7baad8748c9aa217afd155a4d493f>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-14 21:50:43 UTC  ``` This issue was originally reported upstream in Oct 2015 and the fix was waiting for inclusion in the next OpenSSH upstream release.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c4)  Jakub Jelen    2016-01-15 07:48:06 UTC  ``` Actually, openssh-7.1p2 does not fix this issue and it will be as part of the next release.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0465)

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix two security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure Shell) protocol implementation.
These packages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client
and server.

It was discovered that the OpenSSH server did not sanitize data received
in requests to enable X11 forwarding. An authenticated client with
restricted SSH access could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended
restrictions. (CVE-2016-3115)

An access flaw was discovered in OpenSSH; the OpenSSH client did not
correctly handle failures to generate authentication cookies for untrusted
X11 forwarding. A malicious or compromised remote X application could
possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X
server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested.
(CVE-2016-1908)

All openssh users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid
usernames via a timing attack.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-14 21:48:58 UTC  ``` It was discovered that OpenSSH client did not correctly handle situations when untrusted X11 forwarding was requested and generation of the untrusted authentication cookie failed.  The ssh client continued by generating fake authentication cookie and allowed remote X clients to connect the local X server.  The decision if client connection was accepted was delegated to the X server which, depending on its configuration, could allow clients to open trusted X connection.  This would lead to remote X clients having more privileged access to the local X server than intended.  This problem can occur when X server does not include or enable X Security extension (for X.org X server, this extension is not compiled in by default since 2007) and when it has authentication methods besides MIT cookies enabled (e.g. localuser authentication allowing all X connections from a local user who owns the X session).  Both of these conditions are satisfied on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and current Fedora versions.  The X server does not have X Security extension compiled in and 'xhost +si:localuser:`id -un`' is run from the xinit scripts.  Therefore remote X clients are granted trusted access to the local X server when 'ssh -X' is used, as if 'ssh -Y' was actually used.  The X server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 includes X Security extension (as of RHSA-2013:1620 - <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1620.html> - which was released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5) and hence does not fall back to the use of fake authentication cookie.  This issue was corrected upstream in version 7.1p2:  <http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.1p2>  Upstream commit:  <https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=ed4ce82dbfa8a3a3c8ea6fa0db113c71e234416c>  which needs to be applied after:  <https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=f98a09cacff7baad8748c9aa217afd155a4d493f>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-14 21:50:43 UTC  ``` This issue was originally reported upstream in Oct 2015 and the fix was waiting for inclusion in the next OpenSSH upstream release.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1298741#c4)  Jakub Jelen    2016-01-15 07:48:06 UTC  ``` Actually, openssh-7.1p2 does not fix this issue and it will be as part of the next release.

=== Content from www.openssh.com_ec42a468_20250125_060532.html ===
OpenSSH 7.2 was released on 2016-02-29. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Future deprecation notice
=========================
We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in a near-future
release, specifically:
\* Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
is 768 bits)
This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.
Potentially-incompatible changes
================================
This release disables a number of legacy cryptographic algorithms
by default in ssh:
\* Several ciphers blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants
and the rijndael-cbc aliases for AES.
\* MD5-based and truncated HMAC algorithms.
These algorithms are already disabled by default in sshd.
Changes since OpenSSH 7.1p2
===========================
This is primarily a bugfix release.
Security
--------
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): remove unfinished and unused roaming code (was
already forcibly disabled in OpenSSH 7.1p2).
\* ssh(1): eliminate fallback from untrusted X11 forwarding to
trusted forwarding when the X server disables the SECURITY
extension.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): increase the minimum modulus size supported for
diffie-hellman-group-exchange to 2048 bits.
\* sshd(8): pre-auth sandboxing is now enabled by default (previous
releases enabled it for new installations via sshd\_config).
New Features
------------
\* all: add support for RSA signatures using SHA-256/512 hash
algorithms based on draft-rsa-dsa-sha2-256-03.txt and
draft-ssh-ext-info-04.txt.
\* ssh(1): Add an AddKeysToAgent client option which can be set to
'yes', 'no', 'ask', or 'confirm', and defaults to 'no'. When
enabled, a private key that is used during authentication will be
added to ssh-agent if it is running (with confirmation enabled if
set to 'confirm').
\* sshd(8): add a new authorized\_keys option "restrict" that includes
all current and future key restrictions (no-\*-forwarding, etc.).
Also add permissive versions of the existing restrictions, e.g.
"no-pty" -> "pty". This simplifies the task of setting up
restricted keys and ensures they are maximally-restricted,
regardless of any permissions we might implement in the future.
\* ssh(1): add ssh\_config CertificateFile option to explicitly list
certificates. bz#2436
\* ssh-keygen(1): allow ssh-keygen to change the key comment for all
supported formats.
\* ssh-keygen(1): allow fingerprinting from standard input, e.g.
"ssh-keygen -lf -"
\* ssh-keygen(1): allow fingerprinting multiple public keys in a
file, e.g. "ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys" bz#1319
\* sshd(8): support "none" as an argument for sshd\_config
Foreground and ChrootDirectory. Useful inside Match blocks to
override a global default. bz#2486
\* ssh-keygen(1): support multiple certificates (one per line) and
reading from standard input (using "-f -") for "ssh-keygen -L"
\* ssh-keyscan(1): add "ssh-keyscan -c ..." flag to allow fetching
certificates instead of plain keys.
\* ssh(1): better handle anchored FQDNs (e.g. 'cvs.openbsd.org.') in
hostname canonicalisation - treat them as already canonical and
remove the trailing '.' before matching ssh\_config.
Bugfixes
--------
\* sftp(1): existing destination directories should not terminate
recursive uploads (regression in openssh 6.8) bz#2528
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): correctly send back SSH2\_MSG\_UNIMPLEMENTED
replies to unexpected messages during key exchange. bz#2949
\* ssh(1): refuse attempts to set ConnectionAttempts=0, which does
not make sense and would cause ssh to print an uninitialised stack
variable. bz#2500
\* ssh(1): fix errors when attempting to connect to scoped IPv6
addresses with hostname canonicalisation enabled.
\* sshd\_config(5): list a couple more options usable in Match blocks.
bz#2489
\* sshd(8): fix "PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +..." inside a Match block.
\* ssh(1): expand tilde characters in filenames passed to -i options
before checking whether or not the identity file exists. Avoids
confusion for cases where shell doesn't expand (e.g. "-i ~/file"
vs. "-i~/file"). bz#2481
\* ssh(1): do not prepend "exec" to the shell command run by "Match
exec" in a config file, which could cause some commands to fail
in certain environments. bz#2471
\* ssh-keyscan(1): fix output for multiple hosts/addrs on one line
when host hashing or a non standard port is in use bz#2479
\* sshd(8): skip "Could not chdir to home directory" message when
ChrootDirectory is active. bz#2485
\* ssh(1): include PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes in ssh -G config dump.
\* sshd(8): avoid changing TunnelForwarding device flags if they are
already what is needed; makes it possible to use tun/tap
networking as non-root user if device permissions and interface
flags are pre-established
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): RekeyLimits could be exceeded by one packet.
bz#2521
\* ssh(1): fix multiplexing master failure to notice client exit.
\* ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): avoid fatal() for PKCS11 tokens that present
empty key IDs. bz#1773
\* sshd(8): avoid printf of NULL argument. bz#2535
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): allow RekeyLimits larger than 4GB. bz#2521
\* ssh-keygen(1): sshd(8): fix several bugs in (unused) KRL signature
support.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): fix connections with peers that use the key
exchange guess feature of the protocol. bz#2515
\* sshd(8): include remote port number in log messages. bz#2503
\* ssh(1): don't try to load SSHv1 private key when compiled without
SSHv1 support. bz#2505
\* ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): fix incorrect error messages during key
loading and signing errors. bz#2507
\* ssh-keygen(1): don't leave empty temporary files when performing
known\_hosts file edits when known\_hosts doesn't exist.
\* sshd(8): correct packet format for tcpip-forward replies for
requests that don't allocate a port bz#2509
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): fix possible hang on closed output. bz#2469
\* ssh(1): expand %i in ControlPath to UID. bz#2449
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): fix return type of openssh\_RSA\_verify. bz#2460
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): fix some option parsing memory leaks. bz#2182
\* ssh(1): add a some debug output before DNS resolution; it's a
place where ssh could previously silently stall in cases of
unresponsive DNS servers. bz#2433
\* ssh(1): remove spurious newline in visual hostkey. bz#2686
\* ssh(1): fix printing (ssh -G ...) of HostKeyAlgorithms=+...
\* ssh(1): fix expansion of HostkeyAlgorithms=+...
Documentation
-------------
\* ssh\_config(5), sshd\_config(5): update default algorithm lists to
match current reality. bz#2527
\* ssh(1): mention -Q key-plain and -Q key-cert query options.
bz#2455
\* sshd\_config(8): more clearly describe what AuthorizedKeysFile=none
does.
\* ssh\_config(5): better document ExitOnForwardFailure. bz#2444
\* sshd(5): mention internal DH-GEX fallback groups in manual.
bz#2302
\* sshd\_config(5): better description for MaxSessions option.
bz#2531
Portability
-----------
\* ssh(1), sftp-server(8), ssh-agent(1), sshd(8): Support Illumos/
Solaris fine-grained privileges. Including a pre-auth privsep
sandbox and several pledge() emulations. bz#2511
\* Renovate redhat/openssh.spec, removing deprecated options and
syntax.
\* configure: allow --without-ssl-engine with --without-openssl
\* sshd(8): fix multiple authentication using S/Key. bz#2502
\* sshd(8): read back from libcrypto RAND\_\* before dropping
privileges. Avoids sandboxing violations with BoringSSL.
\* Fix name collision with system-provided glob(3) functions.
bz#2463
\* Adapt Makefile to use ssh-keygen -A when generating host keys.
bz#2459
\* configure: correct default value for --with-ssh1 bz#2457
\* configure: better detection of \_res symbol bz#2259
\* support getrandom() syscall on Linux

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1316829#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-11 09:11:18 UTC  ```  Missing sanitisation of untrusted input allows an authenticated user who is able to request X11 forwarding to inject commands to xauth(1).  Injection of xauth commands grants the ability to read arbitrary files under the authenticated user's privilege. Other xauth commands allow limited information leakage, file overwrite, port probing and generally expose xauth(1), which was not written with a hostile user in mind, as an attack surface.  xauth(1) is run under the user's privilege, so this vulnerability offers no additional access to unrestricted accounts, but could circumvent key or account restrictions such as sshd_config ForceCommand, authorized_keys command="..." or restricted shells.  External references:  <http://www.openssh.com/txt/x11fwd.adv>  CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/593>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1316829#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-11 09:11:41 UTC  ```  Created openssh tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1316830](show_bug.cgi?id=1316830 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-3115 openssh: missing sanitisation of input for X11 forwarding [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1316829#c2)  Fedora Update System    2016-03-13 23:53:19 UTC  ``` openssh-7.2p2-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

For authorized_keys that specify a "command" restriction, this issue can be mitigated by also setting the "no-X11-forwarding" restriction.

# RHSA-2016:0741 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openssh security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0741)

## Topic

An update for openssh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the OpenSSH client did not properly enforce the ForwardX11Timeout setting. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2015-5352)
* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled PAM authentication when using privilege separation. An attacker with valid credentials on the system and able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could use this flaw to authenticate as other users. (CVE-2015-6563)
* A use-after-free flaw was found in OpenSSH. An attacker able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could possibly cause sshd to crash or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2015-6564)
* An access flaw was discovered in OpenSSH; the OpenSSH client did not correctly handle failures to generate authentication cookies for untrusted X11 forwarding. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2016-1908)

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 Technical Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.
