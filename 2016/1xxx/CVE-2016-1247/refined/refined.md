Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions set on the Nginx log directory (`/var/log/nginx`) in Debian-based and Gentoo distributions. Specifically, the log directory was owned by the `www-data` user, which is the user that Nginx runs under. This allowed a local attacker with `www-data` privileges to manipulate log files by replacing them with symlinks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the ownership of the log directory by the `www-data` user, allowing for modification.
*   **Log Rotation Handling:** The log rotation mechanism, particularly the use of a USR1 signal to trigger log reopening, could be manipulated if an attacker replaced log files with symlinks
*   **Vulnerable logrotate configuration:** The standard logrotate configuration file, which used the `create` directive to create new logfiles owned by `www-data`, was a contributing factor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with `www-data` user privileges could exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges. This is achieved by replacing a log file with a symlink to `/etc/ld.so.preload` and causing nginx to write the path of a malicious shared library there and then using a SUID binary (e.g. `sudo`) to trigger the loading of the malicious library.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation would grant the attacker full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system with the privileges of the Nginx web server user (`www-data`). This is usually gained through a compromised web application hosted on the Nginx server.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker replaces the Nginx error log file with a symlink pointing to `/etc/ld.so.preload`
*   **Trigger Log Rotation:** The attacker relies on the Nginx service restarting or receiving a USR1 signal (usually from logrotate) to force the Nginx process to write to the `/etc/ld.so.preload` file.
*   **Shared library injection:** The attacker leverages `/etc/ld.so.preload` to inject a malicious shared library, which will be loaded by a suid binary and escalate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
*   **`www-data` User Privileges:** The attacker must have the same user privileges as the Nginx web server (`www-data`).
*   **Writable Log Directory:** The attacker must be able to write to the Nginx log directory (`/var/log/nginx`) to replace log files with symlinks.
*   **Ability to Trigger Log Rotation:** The attacker must be able to cause the Nginx service to reopen the log files. On Debian-based systems the log rotation is triggered automatically daily via logrotate.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu) and Gentoo.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by updating Nginx packages to the specified versions in the advisories, which includes changing ownership of `/var/log/nginx` to `root` and modifying the log rotation scripts and default permissions.
*   Exploitation is possible because log directories are world writable and because the nginx init script and logrotate scripts will create a file owned by www-data.
*   The attacker can get a root shell automatically in 24h at most without any admin interaction just by letting the exploit run till 6:25am assuming that daily logrotation has been configured (on Debian-based systems).
