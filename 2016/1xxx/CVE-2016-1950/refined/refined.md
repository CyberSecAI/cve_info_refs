Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1950:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided documents directly mention CVE-2016-1950 and describe it as a buffer overflow during ASN.1 decoding in NSS. Specifically, the Ubuntu notice and the Mozilla security advisory confirms this.
   
**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the way the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries parse certain ASN.1 structures.

   *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
        *   Heap-based buffer overflow.
        *   Incorrect handling of ASN.1 data.
        *   Memory corruption during parsing of X.509 certificates.
        *   Specifically related to BIT STRING decoding in the `sec_asn1d_parse_leaf` function within the NSS library
         *   Also, a use-after-free during XML transformations reported by Nicolas Gr√©goire was addressed by this same update.

   *   **Impact of exploitation:**
        *   Denial of service due to application crash.
        *   Potential arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the affected application.
        *  Attackers could create a specially-crafted certificate, which when parsed by NSS, would cause it to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
   *   **Attack vectors:**
        *   By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website.
        *   By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted message.
        *   Via processing of specially crafted certificates.

   *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
       *   Ability to craft a malicious certificate or control a website visited by the victim.
       *   No specific user privileges are required initially. 

**3. Additional Information From the Provided Content:**
    *   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affected several products including:
         * Mozilla Firefox
         * Mozilla Thunderbird
         * Network Security Services (NSS)
         * NetScape Portable Runtime (NSPR)
         * Oracle GlassFish Server
         * Oracle iPlanet Web Proxy Server
         * Oracle iPlanet Web Server
         * Oracle Communications Policy Management
         * Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller
    *   **Fix Details:** The vulnerability was addressed in:
        * Firefox 45 and ESR 38.7
        * NSS 3.19.2.3 and 3.21.1
        * Thunderbird 38.7 and 45.0
        * Updated libfreebl3, libsoftokn3, mozilla-nspr, and mozilla-nss packages in Suse Linux
    *   **Mitigation:** Oracle recommends applying the critical patch updates as soon as possible. Workarounds involved blocking required network protocols or removing unnecessary privileges.
    *   **Credit:** The vulnerability was reported by Francis Gabriel of Quarkslab.

**4. More Details Compared to CVE Description:**
