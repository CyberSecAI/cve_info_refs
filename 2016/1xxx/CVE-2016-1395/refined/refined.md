Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1395

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the web interface of Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper input validation (CWE-20) within the web interface. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as *root* on the targeted system. This means the attacker gains complete control over the device, potentially leading to data theft, denial of service, or further network compromise.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the web interface of the affected routers. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network. The web interface can be accessed via the local LAN or, if enabled, through the remote management feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker must be able to reach the web interface of the vulnerable device over the network.
   - No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
   - No specific level of skill or prior knowledge other than typical exploitation techniques seems to be required given the functional exploit code.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS base score of 10.0
   - There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
   - Firmware updates have been released by Cisco to address the vulnerability.
   - Public exploit code was available (Exploitability: Functional).
   - Cisco was not aware of public exploitation before the release of their advisory, but such was made public soon after.
   - The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Samuel Huntley.
