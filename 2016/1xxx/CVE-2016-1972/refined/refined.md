Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the `once` function within the libvpx library used by Mozilla Firefox. This race condition occurs during the initialization of singleton objects which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. Specifically, the issue resides within the handling of the critical section object, where a race condition can cause a deleted object to be accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition in the `once()` function, which is intended to perform initialization code only once. When multiple threads try to initialize it concurrently, the following can occur: a thread may deallocate the critical section object while another thread is still trying to access it, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
*   **Use-After-Free:** The race condition can result in a use-after-free scenario. This occurs when a thread attempts to access a memory location that has been freed, leading to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Non-Thread-Safe Static Initialization**: MSVC's handling of local statics inside the `once()` function could result in the variable's initialization being subject to a race.
*   **Missing Status Check:** An implicit failure in initialization due to the race may be missed, leading to inconsistent behavior of subsequent operations on the singleton objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service by causing a crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly demonstrated, the use-after-free could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution if attacker can gain the ability to control the freed memory.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free vulnerability will corrupt memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker via a crafted web page or email message using specially crafted data.
*   **Browser Interaction:**  A user would need to view the crafted page or email to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote, needing no prior access to the victim's system.
*   **Limited Technical Skill:** The vulnerability can be exploited with limited technical skill if a reliable exploit mechanism is found. However, crafting this mechanism requires advanced exploitation skills and knowledge.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, in the form of visiting a malicious web page or opening a specially crafted email.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows systems as the critical section objects are Windows-specific. Linux, macOS, and Android systems are unaffected.
*   The `once()` function is intended to provide thread-safe initialization of singletons, but due to the race condition, is vulnerable to use-after-free.
*   The issue stems from the lack of proper synchronization during the deletion and usage of the critical section object.
*   The fix involves using atomic operations to manage state and ensure that memory is only freed after all operations on it have completed.
* The code was patched to use atomic operations and eliminate race condition
