Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-1355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw within the HTTP web-based management interface of Cisco FireSIGHT System Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is specifically a reflected XSS vulnerability as the malicious script is delivered as part of the request and reflected back to the user within the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can inject malicious script into the web interface. When a user views the affected page, the malicious script is executed within their browser. The script could steal the user's session cookie, redirect the user to a malicious page, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 4.3 indicating moderate risk. This score is based on:
    *   **Access Vector:** Network (AV:N) - Attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
    *   **Access Complexity:** Medium (AC:M) - Requires some level of user interaction like a crafted link.
    *   **Authentication:** None (Au:N) - No authentication required for the initial attack.
    *   **Confidentiality Impact:** None (C:N) - The attack does not directly compromise the confidentiality of the system, but allows for information theft through session hijacking.
    *   **Integrity Impact:** Partial (I:P) - The attacker can modify the interface and perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **Availability Impact:** None (A:N) - The attack does not directly impact the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is network-based, targeting the web interface of the Cisco FireSIGHT System Software.
*   The attacker would need to send a crafted request containing the malicious script. This would likely be done through a malicious link sent to the victim that they would need to click or otherwise have their browser directed to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco FireSIGHT System Software.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system to inject the malicious script.
*   The attacker needs to trick or entice a user into accessing the malicious link to trigger the execution of the injected script.

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected product is Cisco FireSIGHT System Software Release 6.1.0.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco Bug ID CSCuy41687.
*   The advisory includes a link to a Cisco document explaining XSS attacks for more context.
