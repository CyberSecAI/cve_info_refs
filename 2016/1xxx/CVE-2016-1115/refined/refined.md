The provided content relates to CVE-2016-1115.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a host name verification problem affecting wildcard certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way ColdFusion handles host name verification when using wildcard certificates. Specifically, it does not properly validate the certificate against the expected hostname.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a moderate security risk. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. By using a wildcard certificate with a manipulated hostname, an attacker could potentially intercept and potentially modify traffic between a client and a ColdFusion server. This could lead to data exposure or manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves an attacker being in a position to intercept network traffic between a client and a ColdFusion server. They need to have the capability to generate or acquire a malicious wildcard certificate that can be used to impersonate the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept traffic, and have the ability to generate or obtain a malicious wildcard certificate that matches the wildcard pattern but has a different, attacker-controlled hostname that would normally fail verification.
