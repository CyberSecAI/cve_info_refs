The provided content relates to CVE-2016-1807.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the handling of disk images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a race condition that can be triggered when accessing disk image properties.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker can read kernel memory. In some cases, the exploit can be used to disclose freed memory back to the user space.

**Attack vectors:**
A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a race condition between IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty (which reads properties with a lock) and IOHDIXController's setProperty method (which releases properties without a lock).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs local access to the system.
