Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper input validation within the web interface of Cisco Finesse. This allows an attacker to manipulate HTTP requests and cause the Finesse server to make requests to an arbitrary host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The core weakness is the ability of an attacker to induce the Finesse server to send HTTP requests to a destination of the attacker's choice. This is a classic SSRF vulnerability.
- Improper Input Validation: The Finesse web interface fails to properly validate or sanitize the input used to construct outgoing HTTP requests, allowing for the injection of arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can trigger the Finesse server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary hosts. This could lead to:
    - Information Disclosure: Accessing internal resources not publicly available.
    - Port Scanning: Identifying open ports on internal or external systems.
    - Resource Manipulation: Potentially interacting with other services to perform unintended actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **network-based**, originating remotely via HTTP requests to the Finesse web interface.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Finesse server.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **Medium** severity with a CVSS base score of 5.0 and a temporal score of 4.1.
- The exploit is considered **functional**, meaning the code to exploit it is readily available and works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, users are advised to upgrade their software.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Cisco Finesse ranging from 8.5(1) through 11.0(1).

**CVE Description:**
The description provided within the content aligns with the official description for CVE-2016-1373:  "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger the Finesse server to perform an HTTP request to an arbitrary host. This type of attack is commonly referred to as server-side request forgery (SSRF)."
