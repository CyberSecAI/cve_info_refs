Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2016-1957:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A memory leak occurs in the `libstagefright` library when an array is deallocated during MP4 processing. The root cause is incorrect memory management; specifically, using a single `delete` operator to free memory that was allocated as an array via `new char[]`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory leak:** Improper deallocation of memory leads to a memory leak over time. The memory leak could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By processing a specially crafted MP4 file, an attacker can cause a memory leak, eventually leading to the consumption of available memory resources. This will result in a denial-of-service as the system becomes non-responsive due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to open a specially crafted website (or by viewing a crafted video), which then triggers the vulnerable code during MP4 processing. An email client context with HTML parsing enabled may also be affected.
*   **Local:** Although the primary vector is remote via crafted websites or emails, there is potential to trigger the vulnerability via processing malicious local files too.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote/Network:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable software. This could be done via a website or within an email message containing HTML.
*   **User Interaction:** Requires user interaction by visiting a malicious web site or by viewing/opening a malicious MP4 video file or email with HTML parsing.
*   **Low Privileges Required:** An attacker requires no special privileges to trigger this vulnerability as it stems from a regular operation (MP4 processing) of the application.

**Additional Notes from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Mozilla Firefox (prior to version 45.0, ESR prior to 38.7), Thunderbird (prior to 38.7, and fixed in 45), and potentially other applications using `libstagefright` library.
*   The fix involves using `delete[]` for array deallocation instead of `delete`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by external reporters, who may have been eligible for a bounty reward.
* The severity is considered "moderate" (SUSE) or "important" (Debian, openSUSE).
*   It may not result in a crash but rather a memory leak over time if not fixed.
