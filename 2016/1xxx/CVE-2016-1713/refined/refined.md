CVE-2016-1713:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient file type check and inadequate sanitization of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended security measures. The vulnerability is a result of an insufficient fix for CVE-2015-6000.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Inadequate MIME type check, relying on `mime_content_type()` which can be circumvented by embedding malicious code within valid image files (e.g., EXIF data of a JPEG).
    - Insufficient check for PHP code within the uploaded file, which can be bypassed using PHP short tags or other scripting languages.
    - Unrestricted file naming, allowing an attacker to specify a ".php" extension for the uploaded file, leading to its execution by the web server.
    - Uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory ("test/logo/"), enabling remote execution.
  - Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting Vtiger CRM software.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Attacker uploads a specially crafted image file containing malicious code via the company logo upload functionality in the administrative interface.
    - The file is uploaded with a .php extension.
    - The attacker then accesses the uploaded file via its URL, executing the code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Requires an authenticated user with access to the administrative interface of Vtiger CRM.
    - Ability to craft a malicious image file with embedded code.
    - Ability to send HTTP POST requests with specific form data.
