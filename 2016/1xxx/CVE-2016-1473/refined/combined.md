| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 8.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 8.3 |

Hidden SNMP community in Cisco
SG220 series

Security advisory
12/09/2016

Nicolas Collignon
Renaud Dubourguais

www.synacktiv.com

5 rue Sextius Michel 75015 Paris

Vulnerability description

The Cisco SG220 series

The SG220 series is a range of switches provided by Cisco to small businesses which “bridge the gap between managed
and smart switches to offer customers the best of both worlds” and “provide the higher levels of security, management, and
scalability you expect from managed switches, affordably priced like smart switches”.

The issue

Synacktiv   has   identified   a   vulnerability   in   the   Cisco   SG220   series   allowing   unauthenticated   attackers   to   get   a   SNMP
read/write access to the remote switch.

The issue can be exploited even if no SNMP community has been configured. The SNMP service must be enabled and
reachable.

Affected versions

The following versions has been proved to be affected:

•

•

Smart Plus Switch Firmware 1.0.0.17;

Smart Plus Switch Firmware 1.0.0.18.

Mitigation

For the moment, no official mitigation exists as we have just contacted the Cisco Product Security Incident Response.

Technical description and proof-of-concept

Attack scenario

To illustrate our proof-of-concept, the chosen scenario is an attacker acting from the internal network with a network access
to the the SNMP service.

Vulnerability discovery

The SNMP service is not enabled by default on Cisco SG220. It can be enabled through the command line or through the
Web administration panel. Once enabled, the SNMP configuration panels display an empty list of user.

No community are displayed:

No SNMP users are configured:

The SNMP part of the “show run” output only contains 1 line:

snmp­server

So we really think that no one can access the SNMP service since no community/user is available.

But   wait,   let's   see   what   happens   when   the   SNMP   service   is   started.   The   system   will   eventually   calls   the   function
sal_snmp_restart in the library libsal.so. This function then calls sal_snmp_confFile_update. It is responsible for creating the
SNMP configuration file /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.

Below is an extract of the assembly code showing that the function sal_snmp_confFile_update adds a hardcoded user and
password to the SNMP configuration file.

 3/5

This user is hidden as it is not reported in any user interface provided by the switch. It has read and write access to all SNMP
OIDs.

Impact

A  successful  exploitation  allows   an   attacker  to  read   or   write  any  SNMP  OID  and  therefore   leak   a  part  of   the  device's
configuration.

One simple way to take advantage of the SNMP write access is to update information which can be displayed in the Web
administration console in order to exploit a persistent XSS vulnerability without being authenticated.

It may also be possible to transform the SNMP write access into a privileges escalation by writing to OIDs that will be used
afterward and processed in an unsafe manner by the switch internal SNMP client.

Proof of concept

The following snmpwalk command will dump all the switch OID:

$ snmpwalk ­v 1 ­c rmonmgmtuicommunity <switch> .

As an example, the following command will save a persistent XSS payload in the SNMP database.

$ snmpset ­v1 ­c rmonmgmtuicommunity TARGET_IP sysLocation.0 s \

'<script>alert(["hello","from","snmp"].join(String.fromCharCode(32)))</script>'

SNMPv2­MIB::sysLocation.0 = STRING:
<script>alert([\"hello\",\"from\",\"snmp\"].join(String.fromCharCode(32)))</script>

 4/5

Remediation

Disable the SNMP service.
