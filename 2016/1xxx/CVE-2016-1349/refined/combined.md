| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS and IOS XE Software Smart Install Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160323-smi  First Published: 2016 March 23 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuv45410](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuv45410)     CVE-2016-1349     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2016-1349     CWE-399       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160323-smi/oval/cisco-sa-20160323-smi_583.xml)   Email      Summary  * The Smart Install client feature in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  Affected Products  * The Smart Install client feature in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software is a plug-and-play configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new switches. The feature allows a customer to ship a Cisco switch to any location, install it in the network, and power it on without additional configuration requirements.   Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software with the Smart Install client feature enabled. For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the "Fixed Software" section of this advisory.      To determine whether a Cisco IOS or IOS XE device is configured with the Smart Install client feature enabled, use the **show vstack config** privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install client. The following is the output of the **show vstack config** command in a Cisco Catalyst Switch configured as a Smart Install client. The output for **Role: Client** from the **show vstack config** command confirms that the feature is enabled on the device.    ```   switch#show vstack config      Role: Client  Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.100      ```    **Note:**  Smart Install client functionality is enabled by default on Cisco IOS switches.      **Note:** Cisco devices that are configured as a Smart Install director are not affected by this vulnerability.      **Note:** Switches running releases earlier than Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(52)SE are not Smart Install capable, but they can be Smart Install clients if they support the **archive download-sw** privileged EXEC command.      **Determining the Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software Release** To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the command-line interface, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to **Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software** or **Cisco IOS Software**. The image name appears in parentheses followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause an affected device to reload and generate a *crashinfo* file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds available that address this vulnerability other than disabling the Smart Install feature. The Smart Install Feature is enabled by default on client switches. No configuration is needed in the client switches.      In certain releases of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, the Smart Install client feature can be disabled with the global configuration command **no vstack**. In certain releases of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software where the command is available, the vulnerability can be addressed by disabling the Smart Install client feature.      The following example shows the output of the **show vstack config** command in a Cisco Catalyst Switch with the Smart Install client feature disabled:    ```   switch#show vstack config      Role: Client (SmartInstall disabled)     Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.100      ```    **Note:** The **no vstack** global configuration command to disable the Smart Install client feature was introduced with the fix for Cisco bug [CSCtj75729](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729) (*Ability to shut Smart Install default service on TCP port 4786*). If a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release supports the Smart Install client feature but the **no vstack** command does not exist, the release does not contain the fix for Cisco bug [CSCtj75729](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html> Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          **Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software** To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified ("Combined First Fixed").  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.01.4S**-in the following field:                 For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
