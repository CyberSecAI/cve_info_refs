### Summary:
The Android Platform's URLConnection class is vulnerable to HTTP header injection. This vulnerability exists because the URLConnection class, depending on the Android version, uses different implementations, including open-source OkHttp. Versions of OkHttp prior to 2.5.0 have an HTTP header injection vulnerability. If an application uses URLConnection.setRequestProperty() or URLConnection.addRequestProperty() and incorporates untrusted, unvalidated external input into HTTP headers, injection is possible.

### Root Cause:
The vulnerability stems from the use of untrusted and unvalidated external input when setting or adding HTTP headers via `URLConnection.setRequestProperty()` or `URLConnection.addRequestProperty()`. Older versions of OkHttp (prior to 2.5.0) which are used by some Android versions, are vulnerable to HTTP header injection.

### Affected Systems:
Android platforms from version 2.2 up to 6.0. Earlier versions than 2.2 might also be affected. Specifically, Android versions that incorporate vulnerable versions of OkHttp are susceptible.

### Impact:
Exploitation can lead to various impacts depending on the application, including modification of displayed pages, execution of arbitrary scripts, or setting arbitrary values in cookies.

### Attack Vector:
An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers by providing crafted input to an application that uses `URLConnection.setRequestProperty()` or `URLConnection.addRequestProperty()` without proper validation.

### Required Capabilities:
The attacker needs to be able to influence the values passed to `URLConnection.setRequestProperty()` or `URLConnection.addRequestProperty()`. User interaction may be required.

### Mitigation:
Use OkHttp version 2.5.0 or later. Implement input validation to ensure that untrusted data does not contain malicious characters or control characters that could lead to HTTP header injection.
