Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1571:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Xen handles the `INVLPG` instruction when used with non-canonical addresses within a virtualized environment (specifically, when nested virtualization is enabled). While `INVLPG` itself doesn't trigger a General Protection Fault on non-canonical addresses, the `INVVPID` instruction, used internally by Xen to back the intercepted `INVLPG`, fails in such scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect handling of non-canonical addresses:** Xen fails to properly handle non-canonical address when processing the `INVLPG` instruction which leads to an unexpected failure of `INVVPID`.
- **Hypervisor Bug Check:** The failure of `INVVPID` leads to a hypervisor bug check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest operating system can trigger this vulnerability, causing the Xen hypervisor to crash, leading to a denial of service on the host system and all other guests hosted by it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Guest OS:** The attack vector is a malicious guest operating system that executes `INVLPG` instruction with a non-canonical address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be running code within a guest virtual machine with shadow mode paging enabled.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute the `INVLPG` instruction with non-canonical address.
- The attacker must be running on an Intel or Cyrix CPU.
- Nested virtualization must be enabled in the guest.
- HVM guest using shadow mode paging

**Vulnerable Systems:**
- Xen versions 3.3 onwards
- Systems using Intel or Cyrix CPUs
- HVM guests using shadow mode paging
- HVM guest with nested virtualization enabled even using Hardware Assisted Paging (EPT)
