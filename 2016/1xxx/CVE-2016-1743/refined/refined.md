Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1743:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from multiple memory corruption issues within the Intel Graphics Driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Memory corruption issues. The exploit specifically targets an integer overflow vulnerability. The exploit code notes a vulnerable instruction sequence in the `AppleIntelHD3000Graphics` driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An application can achieve arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges. This means an attacker can gain complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user able to execute code on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit targets the `Apple Intel HD 3000 Graphics driver 10.0.0`.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available, demonstrating the vulnerability can be used to escalate privileges to root.
- The exploit leverages a memory allocation and manipulation of a function pointer within the graphics driver to gain code execution.
