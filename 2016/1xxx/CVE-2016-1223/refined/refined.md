- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Directory Traversal
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing access to files outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the user's LAN can gain unauthorized access to files on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable device.
