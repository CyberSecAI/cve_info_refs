{
  "CVE-2016-1981": {
    "Description": "Qemu emulator built with the e1000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing data via transmit or receive descriptors, provided the initial receive/transmit descriptor head(TDH/RDH) is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance resulting in DoS.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the way QEMU's e1000 NIC emulation implementation processes data using transmit or receive descriptors. Specifically, if the initial receive/transmit descriptor head (TDH/RDH) is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer, it can cause an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of descriptor head registers.",
       "Insufficient checks for out-of-bounds conditions in descriptor processing."
    ],
    "Impact": "A privileged user inside a guest operating system can trigger the infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the QEMU instance and crashing the virtual machine.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the transmit/receive descriptors within the guest operating system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a privileged user inside the guest operating system to manipulate the transmit/receive descriptor head registers and trigger the infinite loop. The attacker needs to have control over the guest's network configuration and access to the emulated e1000 NIC."
