# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1298570#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-14 12:59:40 UTC  ``` Qemu emulator built with the e1000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing data via transmit or receive descriptors, provided the initial receive/transmit descriptor head(TDH/RDH) is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer.  A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance resulting in DoS.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1299116#c0)  Robert Scheck    2016-01-16 00:47:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1115355](attachment.cgi?id=1115355 "qemu-img-bug.ovf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1115355&action=edit "qemu-img-bug.ovf") qemu-img-bug.ovf  Description of problem: qemu-img only creates broken VMDK image files that can't be used for within an OVA file for importing a virtual machine into VMware vSphere/ESXi. Every VMDK file created by qemu-img leads during import to the error message:    Not a supported disk format (sparse VMDK version too old)  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): qemu-img-1.5.3-105.el7_2.1.x86_64 qemu-img-2.5.0-3.fc24.x86_64 (rebuilt from Fedora Rawhide for RHEL 7) VMware vSphere Client, Version 5.1.0, Build 1064113 VMware ESXi, Version 5.1.0, Build 1065491, German-000  How reproducible: Everytime, see above and below.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. cd /tmp/ 2. dd if=/dev/zero of=qemu-img-bug.img bs=1M count=1 3. qemu-img convert qemu-img-bug.img -O vmdk \      -o adapter_type=lsilogic,subformat=streamOptimized,compat6 \      qemu-img-bug.vmdk 4. tar cf qemu-img-bug.ova qemu-img-bug.ovf qemu-img-bug.vmdk 5. Try to import qemu-img-bug.ova into VMware -> fails with error above 6. printf '\x03' | dd conv=notrunc of=qemu-img-bug.vmdk bs=1 seek=$((0x4)) 7. tar cf qemu-img-bug.ova qemu-img-bug.ovf qemu-img-bug.vmdk 8. Try to import qemu-img-bug.ova into VMware -> works as expected now  Actual results: qemu-img created VMDK images lead to "Not a supported disk format (sparse VMDK version too old)".  Expected results: qemu-img created VMDK images should not lead to any error message during import into VMware.  Additional info: Credit for printf/dd combination at point 6 goes to Radoslav Gerganov.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1299116#c2)  Robert Scheck    2016-01-18 00:25:21 UTC  ``` Btw, point 6 isn't the ultimate solution, qemu-img created images are still unusable with OVAs on VMware, see also [bug #1299250](show_bug.cgi?id=1299250 "CLOSED ERRATA - qemu-img created VMDK images are unbootable") for details.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1299116#c3)  Ademar Reis    2016-01-19 17:01:25 UTC  ``` Robert, thanks for taking the time to enter a bug report with us.

>> What both directions miss is that the guest could program TDLEN and RDLEN

Use CVE-2016-1981.

## Synopsis

Moderate: qemu-kvm security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2585)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw and an out-of-bounds read flaw were found in the way QEMU's VGA emulator set certain VGA registers while in VBE mode. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-3712)
* An infinite loop flaw was found in the way QEMU's e1000 NIC emulation implementation processed data using transmit or receive descriptors under certain conditions. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance. (CVE-2016-1981)

Red Hat would like to thank Zuozhi Fzz (Alibaba Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-3712.

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

Subject: CVE request Qemu: net: e1000 infinite loop in start_xmit and
 e1000_receive_iov routines

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the e1000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an
infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing data via transmit or
receive descriptors, provided the initial receive/transmit descriptor
head(TDH/RDH) is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance
resulting in DoS.

# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201604-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.0-r2** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Local users within a guest QEMU environment can execute arbitrary code
within the host or a cause a Denial of Service condition of the QEMU
guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.5.0-r2"

```

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] e1000: eliminate infinite loops on out-of-bounds tr

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] e1000: eliminate infinite loops on out-of-bounds transfer start |
| **Date**: | Tue, 19 Jan 2016 14:17:20 +0100 |

---

```
The start_xmit() and e1000_receive_iov() functions implement DMA transfers
iterating over a set of descriptors that the guest's e1000 driver
prepares:

- the TDLEN and RDLEN registers store the total size of the descriptor
  area,

- while the TDH and RDH registers store the offset (in whole tx / rx
  descriptors) into the area where the transfer is supposed to start.

Each time a descriptor is processed, the TDH and RDH register is bumped
(as appropriate for the transfer direction).

QEMU already contains logic to deal with bogus transfers submitted by the
guest:

- Normally, the transmit case wants to increase TDH from its initial value
  to TDT. (TDT is allowed to be numerically smaller than the initial TDH
  value; wrapping at or above TDLEN bytes to zero is normal.) The failsafe
  that QEMU currently has here is a check against reaching the original
  TDH value again -- a complete wraparound, which should never happen.

- In the receive case RDH is increased from its initial value until
  "total_size" bytes have been received; preferably in a single step, or
  in "s->rxbuf_size" byte steps, if the latter is smaller. However, null
  RX descriptors are skipped without receiving data, while RDH is
  incremented just the same. QEMU tries to prevent an infinite loop
  (processing only null RX descriptors) by detecting whether RDH assumes
  its original value during the loop. (Again, wrapping from RDLEN to 0 is
  normal.)

What both directions miss is that the guest could program TDLEN and RDLEN
so low, and the initial TDH and RDH so high, that these registers will
immediately be truncated to zero, and then never reassume their initial
values in the loop -- a full wraparound will never occur.

The condition that expresses this is:

  xdh_start >= s->mac_reg[XDLEN] / sizeof(desc)

i.e., TDH or RDH start out after the last whole rx or tx descriptor that
fits into the TDLEN or RDLEN sized area.

This condition could be checked before we enter the loops, but
pci_dma_read() / pci_dma_write() knows how to fill in buffers safely for
bogus DMA addresses, so we just extend the existing failsafes with the
above condition.

Notes:
    Regarding the public posting: we made an honest effort to vet this
    vulnerability, and the impact seems low -- no host side reads/writes,
    "just" a DoS (infinite loop). We decided the patch could be posted
    publicly, for the usual review process. Jason and Prasad checked the
    patch in the internal discussion already, but comments, improvements
    etc. are clearly welcome. The CVE request is underway. Thanks.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.

CVE-2015-7295

    Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc. discovered that the Virtual Network
    Device support is vulnerable to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion), that could occur when receiving large packets.

CVE-2015-7504

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a heap-based buffer overflow that could result in
    denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code
    execution.

CVE-2015-7512

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a buffer overflow that could result in denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2015-8345

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the eepro100
    emulator contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop when
    processing Command Blocks, eventually resulting in
    denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8504

    Lian Yihan of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the VNC display
    driver support is vulnerable to an arithmetic exception flaw that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8558

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the USB EHCI
    emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite
    loop during communication between the host controller and a device
    driver. This could lead to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion).

CVE-2015-8743

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
    vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
    resulting in information leak or memory corruption.

CVE-2016-1568

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI
    emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1714

    Donghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration
    emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write
    access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1922

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests
    support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u12.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c2)  Stefan Hajnoczi    2016-09-16 08:50:45 UTC  ``` Please verify as follows:  Create a 4 MB (!) LVM volume on the host.  I have called it /dev/testvg/testlv.  Now create qcow2 metadata on the LVM volume:  $ sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 /dev/testvg/testlv 10G  (The reason for using an LVM volume instead of a regular file is that its size is fixed.  Since the LVM volume cannot grow automatically we can cause ENOSPC to happen when the guest writes to it.)  shell1$ sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -cpu host -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=raw,file=rhel72.img -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=qcow2,file=/dev/testvg/testlv,werror=stop  guest# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/vdb oflag=direct bs=4k  The guest should be paused almost immediately because /dev/testvg/testlv runs out of space and returns an ENOSPC write error.  Now launch the destination QEMU for live migration (on the same host):  shell2$ sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -cpu host -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=raw,file=rhel72.img -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=qcow2,file=/dev/testvg/testlv,werror=stop -incoming tcp::1234 (qemu1) migrate tcp:127.0.0.1:1234  After migration has completed the guest is still paused.  Let's grow the LVM volume so the failed write request can be retried:  $ sudo lvresize -L +4M /dev/testvg/testlv (qemu2) c  Expected behavior: Guest resumes successfully when the 'c' monitor command is issued on destination QEMU.  Note that it will probably pause again very soon because the LVM volume runs out of space again.  Actual behavior: "Virtqueue size exceeded" error from destination QEMU and guest is terminated after the 'c' monitor command is issued.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c4)  Miroslav Rezanina    2016-09-20 16:03:10 UTC  ``` Fix included in qemu-kvm-1.5.3-126.el7   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c6)  huiqingding    2016-09-21 03:21:58 UTC  ``` Reproduce this bug using the following version: kernel-3.10.0-509.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-1.5.3-125.el7.x86_64  Do the test as [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c2), the detailed steps as [bz1372763 comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1372763#c11 "CLOSED ERRATA - RHSA-2016-1756 breaks migration of instances"). After migration and type "c" in destination qemu-kvm, guest cannot resume and destination qemu-kvm quits with error "Virtqueue size exceeded".   Verify this bug using the following version: kernel-3.10.0-509.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-1.5.3-126.el7.x86_64  Do the test as [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c2), the detailed steps as [bz1372763 comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1372763#c11 "CLOSED ERRATA - RHSA-2016-1756 breaks migration of instances").  After migration and type "c" in destination qemu-kvm, guest can resume normally and guest is paused with io-error.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c7)  huiqingding    2016-09-21 03:23:05 UTC  ``` Based on [comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c6), set this bug to be verified.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-03 20:03:09 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
