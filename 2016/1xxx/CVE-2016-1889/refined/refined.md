- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in bounds checking of guest memory accesses greater than 4GB by device emulations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper bounds checking leads to out-of-bounds access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious guest can gain access to the heap of the bhyve process, which runs as root, potentially leading to full control of the host.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious guest can craft device descriptors to trigger the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be running code inside a bhyve virtual machine with more than 3GB of guest memory configured.
