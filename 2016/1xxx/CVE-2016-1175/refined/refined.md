- An attacker would need to create a malicious web page that, when visited by a user who is also logged into the vulnerable device, would cause the browser to make a request that modifies settings on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page that a user with access to the vulnerable device can be lured into visiting.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges or authentication.
