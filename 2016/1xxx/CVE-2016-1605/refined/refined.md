Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2016-1605 vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2016-1605, and the description aligns with the information provided by the Zero Day Initiative advisory. The document also mentions "Sentinel Server Authentication Bypass and Arbitrary File Download (CVE-2016-1605)". Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `ReportViewServlet` servlet of NetIQ Sentinel Server.
*   Specifically, the `fileName` parameter is susceptible to directory traversal when `fileType` is set to "PREVIEW".

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `fileName` parameter within the `ReportViewServlet` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** There's a separate vulnerability in the authentication handling of the `LogonFormController` which allows an attacker to bypass authentication. This is a prerequisite to exploit the file disclosure vulnerability, as authentication is normally required to access the affected servlet.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read the content of arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, credentials, or proprietary data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable servlet.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `ReportViewServlet` setting `fileType` to "PREVIEW" and including directory traversal sequences in the `fileName` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Sentinel Server.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The attacker needs to leverage the authentication bypass flaw or have a valid user account.
*   **HTTP Request Construction:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details (from ZDI advisory):**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by "rgod" working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   The vendor (NetIQ/Micro Focus) has released a patch (Sentinel Server 7.4.2) to address this issue.
*   The ZDI advisory ID is ZDI-16-406.

**Summary of Key Points:**

The vulnerability is a combination of a directory traversal flaw and an authentication bypass issue. Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the vulnerable server, resulting in information disclosure.
