Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1924:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `opj_tgt_reset` function of the OpenJPEG library.
- It is triggered during the processing of certain malformed JPEG 2000 image files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `opj_tgt_reset` function is vulnerable to a segmentation fault (SEGV) on an unknown address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition due to the segmentation fault, causing the application to crash.
- It could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution if the crash could be controlled by an attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted, malformed JPEG 2000 image file to a user/application that uses the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malformed JPEG 2000 file to the target. This could be achieved via email, a website, or any other means of file transfer.
- The attacker needs no access to the target system aside from sending the malicious file.
