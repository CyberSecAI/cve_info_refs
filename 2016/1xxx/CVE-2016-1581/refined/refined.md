Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1581:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from LXD incorrectly setting permissions when creating a loop-based ZFS pool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Incorrect permissions on the ZFS loop device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to copy and read data from any LXD container. This means a malicious user with access to the system could potentially gain access to sensitive information within other containers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with LXD on the system.
*   The attacker must have the ability to trigger the creation of a loop-based ZFS pool, which is part of LXD functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local user account on a system running a vulnerable version of LXD.
*   Ability to interact with the LXD daemon/API.
*   Knowledge of how to create and manage containers and storage pools within LXD.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   The provided content explicitly mentions that this issue was discovered by Robie Basak.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in the lxd package versions 2.0.2-0ubuntu1~16.04.1 for Ubuntu 16.04 and 0.20-0ubuntu4.2 for Ubuntu 15.10.
*   The issue specifically relates to loop-based ZFS pools which suggests a specific storage configuration is required for exploitation.

**Summary**

CVE-2016-1581 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in LXD caused by incorrect permission settings during the creation of loop-based ZFS storage pools. This allows a local user to read data from any LXD container on the same system.
