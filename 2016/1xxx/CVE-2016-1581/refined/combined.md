# USN-2988-1: LXD vulnerabilities

31 May 2016

Several security issues were fixed in LXD.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [lxd](/security/cves?package=lxd) - Container hypervisor based on LXC

## Details

Robie Basak discovered that LXD incorrectly set permissions when setting up

a loop based ZFS pool. A local attacker could use this issue to copy and

read the data of any LXD container. ([CVE-2016-1581](/security/CVE-2016-1581))

Robie Basak discovered that LXD incorrectly set permissions when switching

an unprivileged container into privileged mode. A local attacker could use

this issue to access any world readable path in the container directory,

including setuid binaries. ([CVE-2016-1582](/security/CVE-2016-1582))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [lxd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxd)
  -
  [2.0.2-0ubuntu1~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxd/2.0.2-0ubuntu1~16.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [lxd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxd)
  -
  [0.20-0ubuntu4.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lxd/0.20-0ubuntu4.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# LXD is now under Canonical[¶](#lxd-is-now-under-canonical "Permanent link")

The LXD project is no longer part of the Linux Containers project but can now be found directly on Canonical's websites.

Website: <https://ubuntu.com/lxd>

Github: <https://github.com/canonical/lxd>

Forum: <https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/lxd/>

Documentation: <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/>

**NOTE**: A community fork of LXD, Incus, is now part of the Linux Containers project.

You can learn more here: <https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/>

# Project announcement[¶](#project-announcement "Permanent link")

Date: 4th of July 2023

Hello,

Canonical, the creator and main contributor of the LXD project has decided that after over 8 years as part of the Linux Containers community, the project would now be better served directly under Canonicalâs own set of projects.

While the team behind Linux Containers regrets that decision and will be missing LXD as one of its projects, it does respect Canonicalâs decision and is now in the process of moving the project over.

Concretely, the expected changes are:

* <https://github.com/lxc/lxd> will now become <https://github.com/canonical/lxd>
* <https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd> will disappear and be replaced with a mention directing users to <https://ubuntu.com/lxd>
* The LXD YouTube channel will be handed over to the Canonical team
* The LXD section on the Linux Containers community forum will slowly be sunset in favor of the Ubuntu Discourse forum run by Canonical
* The LXD CI infrastructure will be moved under Canonicalâs care
* Image building for Linux Containers will no longer be relying on systems provided by Canonical, limiting image building to `x86_64` and `aarch64`.

What will not be changing:

* The rest of the Linux Containers projects remain unaffected
* The image server, currently used by both LXC and LXD will keep operating as normal, though with less architectures available as mentioned above

Those changes will likely all happen pretty rapidly as everything is relatively tightly integrated together. As a result, you may notice a bit of bumpiness while Canonical sets up the replacement infrastructure.

Sincerely,

The Linux Containers team
