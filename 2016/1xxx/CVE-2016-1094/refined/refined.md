Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-1094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader DC handles FlateDecode streams. A specially crafted PDF with a specific FlateDecode stream can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader DC.
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain code execution within the context of the current user's process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted PDF document.
- The user must interact with the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page that contains a malicious PDF in order for the exploit to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document with a specific FlateDecode stream to trigger the use-after-free.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious PDF to the victim, either by tricking them into opening a file, or by visiting a malicious page containing the PDF.
- No specific privileges are required for the attacker other than ability to deliver and trick the user into opening the crafted PDF file.
