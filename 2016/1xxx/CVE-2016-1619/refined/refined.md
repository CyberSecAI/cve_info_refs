{
  "CVE-2016-1619": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in the (1) sycc422_to_rgb and (2) sycc444_to_rgb functions in fxcodec/codec/fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp in PDFium, as used in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.82, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflows in the `sycc422_to_rgb` and `sycc444_to_rgb` functions within the PDFium library.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
       "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have other unspecified impacts.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "A crafted PDF document"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file. No user interaction is needed other than opening the crafted PDF.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability lies in how PDFium handles image color space conversions. By creating a specially crafted PDF, attackers can cause integer overflow when the `sycc422_to_rgb` and `sycc444_to_rgb` functions convert color values, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory access."
