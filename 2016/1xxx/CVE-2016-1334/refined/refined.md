Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the web interface of the Cisco Small Business 500 Series Wireless Access Point devices, specifically in the component used for updating the system time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The web interface fails to properly validate input when updating the system time. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Integrity Impact (I:P):** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify system configurations and impact the integrity of the device. While the specific data manipulated is the system time, this could potentially disrupt device operation or impact logging and other time-sensitive functions. No impact on Confidentiality or Availability is indicated.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   **Low Access Complexity (AC:L):** Exploitation requires a low level of complexity, suggesting it is relatively easy to perform.
*   **No Authentication Required (Au:N):** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable web interface of the Cisco Small Business 500 Series Wireless Access Point. No specific position within the network is specified, other than network access. No specific skills are required, aside from being able to send an HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business 500 Series Wireless Access Point Release 1.0.4.4.
*   There are no known workarounds.
