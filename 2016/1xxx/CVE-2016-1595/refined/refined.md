Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into a Hibernate Query Language (HQL) query within the file download functionality of Micro Focus Service Desk. Specifically, the `entityName` parameter from the request is directly inserted into the HQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is the HQL injection, which occurs when unsanitized user-provided input is directly used in constructing a database query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `entityName` parameter before incorporating it into the HQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker could manipulate the HQL query to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Arbitrary File Download:** It is mentioned that the HQL injection could lead to downloading of arbitrary files from the server, this is not explicitly explained how, but the HQL injection can be used to access database information about file paths or other metadata to construct file download requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** An attacker sends a crafted GET request to the `/LiveTime/WebObjects/LiveTime.woa/wa/DownloadAction/downloadFile` endpoint.
- **Modified `entityName` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious HQL code into the `entityName` parameter of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user or client of the Service Desk application, even with non-privileged access.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `DownloadAction.class`, specifically at line 125:
```java
List<?> attachments = ((com.livetime.Session)session()).getDbSession().createQuery(new StringBuilder().append("from ").append(hasEn).append(" as attach where attach.attachmentId = ").append(hasId.intValue()).toString()).list();
```
- The `hasEn` variable receives its value from the `entityName` parameter and is directly appended into the query.
- The `hasId` variable is the `attachmentId` parameter (integer).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Pedro Ribeiro of Agile Information Security.
- The issue was resolved in Micro Focus Service Desk version 7.2.
- The vulnerability affects Novell Service Desk versions 7.0.3, 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.
- Other vulnerabilities were also present in the same product, including arbitrary file upload (CVE-2016-1593), information disclosure (CVE-2016-1594), and Stored XSS (CVE-2016-1596), all fixed in 7.2.
