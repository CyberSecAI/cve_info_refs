Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-1956 from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from performing certain WebGL operations in Firefox with some Intel GPUs. This results in excessive memory resource consumption, causing a system reboot. Specifically, the issue arises due to an out-of-bounds read when allocating large WebGL buffers on specific Intel drivers for Linux. The vulnerability is a combination of an integer overflow in calculations of buffer sizes, coupled with the failure to check memory allocations against available resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the exhaustion of memory resources on specific Intel GPUs when performing particular WebGL operations due to overly large allocations.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the HTML parser following a failed allocation, which can lead to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a denial of service, requiring the system to be rebooted to regain functionality.
*   **System Instability**: The vulnerability can cause the system to become unresponsive due to memory exhaustion, requiring a reboot.
*   **Application Crash:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to application crashes (Firefox).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Website:** The attacker tricks the user into visiting a specially crafted website that contains malicious WebGL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a webpage.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be tricked into visiting the malicious webpage, as the vulnerability is triggered by opening a website.
*   **Knowledge of WebGL:** The attacker needs the knowledge to craft a specific WebGL shader that causes memory exhaustion on vulnerable Intel GPUs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to a subset of Intel drivers on Linux systems; other operating systems are not affected by this specific flaw.
*   The provided information from Suse indicates this issue is "Resolved," meaning the vulnerability has been patched.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-2917-1) addresses this and multiple other vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is related to a specific type of WebGL shader usage that triggers excessive resource consumption and crashes.
*   Mitigation includes capping of the maximum texture size to prevent overly large allocations.
* The fix involves adding checks on the amount of memory to be allocated during graphics processing to ensure resources are not exhausted.

In summary, CVE-2016-1956 is a vulnerability related to resource management in WebGL, specifically impacting Intel GPUs on Linux. It allows a remote attacker, through a specially crafted webpage, to cause a denial of service on affected systems, potentially requiring a reboot.
