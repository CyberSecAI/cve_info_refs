# CVE-2016-1556 - Notification

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

NETGEAR is aware of the security issue involving the Wireless Protected Setup (WPS) feature. The method by which the information is passed by the router and client may compromise the security of the WPS PIN or passphrase.

This is a software vulnerability that affects only certain NETGEAR devices using the following firmware versions:

* WN604 Wireless N-150 Access Point
* WNAP210v2 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point
* WNAP320 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point
* WNDAP350 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point
* WNDAP360 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point
* WND930 Outdoor Dual Band High Power Wireless-N Access Point

NETGEAR strongly recommends updating the firmware on your device with the latest version to prevent the issue.

You can download the latest firmware version using the following links:

| Access Point Model: | Firmware Version: | Link: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WN604 Wireless N-150 Access Point | v3.3.3 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WN604](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WN604) |
| WNAP210v2 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNAP210v2](http://support.netgear.com/product/WNAP210v2) |
| WNAP320 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNAP320](http://support.netgear.com/product/WNAP320) |
| WNDAP350 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNAP350](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WNDAP350) |
| WNDAP360 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNDAP360](http://support.netgear.com/product/WNDAP360) |
| WNDAP930 Outdoor Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point | v2.0.11 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WND930](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WND930) |

The versions listed in the table address the vulnerability issues and contain measures to prevent exposure of the WPS PIN.  The WPS PIN is disclosed by downloading certain files. The security of the WPS PIN remains at risk if operating a version lower than those listed on the table and not updating the firmware. Access to the wireless network can be compromised if the WPS PIN is known. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by upgrading the firmware as stated in this notification.

# D-Link, Netgear Router Vulnerabiltiies

---

*From*: Dominic Chen <ddchen () andrew cmu edu>

```
Hello,

We’d like to report several vulnerabilities in embedded devices developed by D-Link and Netgear, which were discovered
using our FIRMADYNE framework for emulation and dynamic analysis of Linux-based embedded devices. For more information,
refer to our academic paper and open-source release at <https://github.com/firmadyne/firmadyne>.

Several Netgear devices include unauthenticated webpages that pass form input directly to the command-line, allowing
for a command injection attack in `boardData102.php`, `boardData103.php`, `boardDataJP.php`, `boardDataNA.php`, and
`boardDataWW.php`. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1555. Affected devices include:

Netgear WN604
Netgear WN802Tv2
Netgear WNAP210
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

Several D-Link devices include a web server that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow while parsing the 'dlink_uid'
cookie. The length of the value set in the cookie is obtained using strlen(), which is then passed to memcpy(), and the
value is copied into a fixed-size buffer. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1558. Affected devices include:

D-Link DAP-2310
D-Link DAP-2330
D-Link DAP-2360
D-Link DAP-2553
D-Link DAP-2660
D-Link DAP-2690
D-Link DAP-2695

Several Netgear devices include unauthenticated webpages that disclose the wireless WPS PIN, allowing for information
disclosure. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1556. Affected devices include:

Netgear WN604
Netgear WNAP210
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WND930
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

Several devices by both D-Link and Netgear disclose wireless passwords and administrative usernames/passwords over
SNMP, including OID’s iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4,
iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.4.1.1.1, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.37.4.1.1.1, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.4.1.1.1,
iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.8.1.5, iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.5, iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.7, and
iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.10.1.7. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1557 for Netgear devices, and CVE-2016-1559 for D-Link
devices. Affected devices include:

D-Link DAP-1353
D-Link DAP-2553
D-Link DAP-3520
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

We have not heard back from D-Link after contacting the vendor. Netgear will fix WN604 with firmware 3.3.3 by late
February, but the tentative ETA for the remaining devices is mid-March.

Thanks,

Dominic
