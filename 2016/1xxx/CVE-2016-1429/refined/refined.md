Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1429:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in the web interface of Cisco RV180 VPN and RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The web interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") to navigate outside of the intended webroot directory. This allows access to files in the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to access arbitrary files on the affected system. This includes potentially sensitive files that should not be accessible through the web interface.
- Although not specified, an attacker may be able to use information gathered this way to further compromise the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by an attacker without requiring any prior authentication to the device.
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected Cisco RV180 devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web interface of the vulnerable Cisco RV180 device. The attacker does not need to be on the same LAN, as the advisory mentions remote access.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the web interface of the device including path traversal sequences.

**Additional Information:**
- There are no workarounds that directly address the directory traversal vulnerability. However, mitigations that can help limit exposure, such as disabling remote management or limiting remote management access to specific IP addresses, are provided.
- The affected products are end-of-life (EoL), and Cisco will not release firmware updates to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by security researcher Harri Kuosmanen.
- The CVSS base score for the vulnerability is 7.1 with a temporal score of 6.7.
