Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the handling of the "Close page action" in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. A specially crafted "Close page action" can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed from memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free: The core issue is the reuse of memory that has already been freed, leading to a dangling pointer. This allows an attacker to potentially overwrite or control the freed memory space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process of the application. This allows them to gain control of the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Page or File: Exploitation requires the target user to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious PDF file that contains the specially crafted "Close page action."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document containing the vulnerable "Close page action"
- The attacker needs to get the target user to open the malicious PDF document
