Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-1321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Cisco Universal Small Cell devices that allows for unauthorized retrieval of firmware from a Cisco-hosted binary server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the ability of an attacker to access and retrieve the device's firmware. This is an information disclosure vulnerability, categorized as CWE-200.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper authentication mechanisms, allowing remote, unauthenticated access to the firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The impact of successful exploitation is partial disclosure of information (C:P). Specifically, the attacker can obtain the firmware, which may contain sensitive data, proprietary code, or information about the device's configuration.
*   **No Integrity/Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not directly impact the integrity or availability of the device (I:N/A:N). The attacker cannot directly modify the device or cause it to become unavailable, according to this advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network (AV:N).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability (Au:N).
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability is low (AC:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable devices.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need to have any prior access or account to perform the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.0 and a temporal score of 4.1. The vector string is `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C`
*   **No Workarounds:** At the time of the advisory, there were no workarounds available.
*   **Fixed Software:** Customers were advised to consult Cisco's security advisories and responses archive for software upgrades and complete solutions.
*   **No Public Exploits/Malicious Use (at the time):** Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
