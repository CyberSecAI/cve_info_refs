  "CVE-2016-1606": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Micro Focus Rumba+ v9.4 suffers from multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities when parsing large amounts of bytes to several functions in several OLE controls. An attacker can gain access to the system of the affected node and execute arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of large inputs to several functions within multiple OLE controls.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "System access and arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local",
      "Remote"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send a large string of bytes to the affected functions. This can be achieved locally or remotely, especially since the OLE controls can be triggered through a browser.",
        "details": "The advisory details several specific vulnerable functions, demonstrating different methods of triggering the overflows:\n\n*   **MacroName (WdMacCtl.ocx):** Passing a long string to the `PlayMacro` function of the `ObjectXMacro.ObjectXMacro` COM object causes a stack buffer overflow.\n    *   A proof of concept is provided that shows how to overflow the stack, overwrite the SEH, and then proceeds to execute shellcode.\n*   **NetworkName (iconfig.dll):** Setting the `NetworkName` property of the `ObjectXSNAConfig.ObjectXSNAConfig` COM object with a long string triggers a stack buffer overflow.\n*   **CPName (iconfig.dll):** Similar to the above, setting the `CPName` property of the `ObjectXSNAConfig.ObjectXSNAConfig` COM object with a long string causes a stack buffer overflow.\n*   **PrinterName (ProfEdit.dll):** Setting the `PrinterName` property of the `ProfileEditor.PrintPasteControl` COM object with a long string or URL causes an access violation, potentially due to a buffer overflow.\n*   **Data (FtxBIFF.dll):** Calling the `WriteRecords` function of the `FTXBIFFLib.AS400FtxBIFF` COM object with a large string of data triggers an access violation.\n*   **Serialized (NMSecComParams.dll):** Setting the `Serialized` property of the `NMSECCOMPARAMSLib.SSL3` COM object with a large string causes a stack overflow.\n*   **UserName (NMSecComParams.dll):** Setting the `UserName` property of the `NMSECCOMPARAMSLib.FirewallProxy` COM object with a large string causes a stack overflow.\n*  **LUName (ProfEdit.dll):** Setting the `LUName` property of the `ProfileEditor.MFSNAControl` COM object with a long string causes an access violation, potentially due to a buffer overflow.\n*  **newVal (FTPSFtp.dll):** Calling the `Load` method of the `FTPSFTPLib.SFtpSession` COM object with a long string triggers a stack buffer overrun.\n*  **Host (FTP Client):**  Pasting a long string (300 bytes) into the Host field while creating a new FTP session causes a crash. Although not detailed, it is likely another stack buffer overflow."
