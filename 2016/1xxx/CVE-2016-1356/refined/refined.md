Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in credential authentication for both valid and invalid username-password pairs within the Cisco FireSIGHT System Software. This timing channel vulnerability allows an attacker to differentiate between valid and invalid credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Channel Vulnerability:** The system exhibits a noticeable difference in response time when authenticating with valid vs invalid credentials, which can be exploited to leak information.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to potentially enumerate valid usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Username Enumeration:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to determine a list of valid usernames on the affected system.
- This can be a crucial step for further attacks, such as brute-forcing passwords for the discovered valid user accounts

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability and enumerate usernames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Base) and 4.1 (Temporal), classified as Medium severity.
- The Exploitability is rated as Functional, meaning functional exploit code is available.
- There are no known workarounds available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco FireSIGHT System Software Release 6.1.0.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-255, related to credentials management.
