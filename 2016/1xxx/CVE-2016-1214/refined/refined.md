Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1214:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "Response request" function of Cybozu Garoon. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. This means that an attacker can inject malicious code which will be stored and executed when other users interact with the vulnerable functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a logged-in user. This can lead to:
   - Session hijacking.
   - Stealing of sensitive data such as cookies or credentials.
   - Defacement of the web page.
   - Redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attacker injects malicious scripts into the "Response request" function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted request containing malicious script to the vulnerable function which gets stored by the application.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to access the stored malicious content via the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cybozu Garoon versions 4.2.0 to 4.2.1.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 6.1 (Medium), while CVSS v2 is 2.6 (Low).
- The vulnerability requires user interaction to be exploited.
