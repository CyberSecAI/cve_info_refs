Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-1801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how web proxy auto-config (PAC) files handle HTTPS URLs. Specifically, the full URL, including the path and parameters, is passed to the `FindProxyForURL()` function within the PAC file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the full HTTPS URL to the PAC file. This includes the path and query parameters, which can contain sensitive data that is intended to be protected by HTTPS encryption.
- **Improper Handling of Sensitive Data:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-212: Improper Cross-boundary Removal of Sensitive Data, as the sensitive data is being passed to the PAC file where it can potentially be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker who can control the PAC file can read URLs, including the path and query strings, which might contain sensitive information like session IDs, API keys, personally identifiable information, or other confidential data meant to be protected by HTTPS.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can perform man-in-the-middle attacks to inject malicious PAC files to exploit the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PAC File:** An attacker can provide a malicious PAC file to a victim's browser. This can be achieved by compromising the WPAD server, or performing a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Position:** The attacker must have a privileged network position to intercept and modify the PAC file retrieval process or control the WPAD server. This includes the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Control of PAC File:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the content of the PAC file being served to the victim's browser.

**Affected Products (based on provided content):**
The vulnerability affects multiple products:
-   **Apple:**
    -   iOS (9.3.2 and potentially earlier versions):
    -   OS X El Capitan (v10.11.5 and potentially earlier versions):
    -   tvOS 9.2.1
-   **Google Chrome**
-   **Mozilla Firefox**
-   **Opera**

**Mitigation:**
- Apply the latest updates to the browser.
- Disable WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) if proxy auto-configuration is not needed.
