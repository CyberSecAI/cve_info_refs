Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple memory corruption issues within WebKit's handling of events, specifically when processing the `dispatchEvent` function. This leads to a type confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:**  The core issue involves memory corruption, indicating flaws in how WebKit manages memory during event dispatching.
*   **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability also involves type confusion, meaning that the software is mishandling data types, leading to incorrect operations and memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, which could lead to a full compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Content:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need local access to the target system. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a network.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure the victim to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by `0x1byte` and `Yang Zhao of CM Security`, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Apple addressed the vulnerability in iOS 9.3 and Safari 9.1 by improving memory handling.
