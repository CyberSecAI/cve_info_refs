Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1746:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the IOGraphicsFamily interface failing to validate user-supplied function addresses before using them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Untrusted pointer dereference: The core issue is that the system is using function addresses provided by the user without proper validation. This allows an attacker to potentially redirect the execution flow to an arbitrary location.
- Lack of input validation: The primary weakness is the absence of checks to verify the validity and legitimacy of user-supplied function addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to elevate their privileges, gaining the ability to execute code within the context of the kernel. This level of access provides the attacker with full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: The attack is launched from a local user context, meaning that the attacker would need some form of local access to the vulnerable machine.
- Malicious file: The vulnerability requires user interaction through the opening of a malicious file. The malicious file presumably contains the crafted function addresses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user access: The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.
- Ability to craft a malicious file: The attacker must be able to create or modify a file to include the malicious function addresses that will be passed to the vulnerable code.
- User interaction: The target user must open the crafted malicious file for the exploit to trigger.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists within the IOGraphicsFamily interface.
- Apple has released an update to patch this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is also mentioned in Apple's security advisory for OS X El Capitan v10.11.4 and Security Update 2016-002.
