Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-1848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the parsing of invalid data in the 'mdat' atom of a QuickTime '.mov' file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Specifically, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing the 'mdat' atom.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate data within the 'mdat' atom, leading to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the application using QuickTime).
*   **Application Termination:** As stated in the Apple advisory, a maliciously crafted file may lead to unexpected application termination.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious '.mov' file that, when opened by a vulnerable version of QuickTime, triggers the memory corruption.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The user can be enticed to visit a malicious web page that hosts or links to the malicious file, which upon being opened will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** An attacker can be remote, delivering the exploit via a malicious file or webpage.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious website.
