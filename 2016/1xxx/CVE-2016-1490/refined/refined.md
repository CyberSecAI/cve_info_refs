Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the Lenovo SHAREit for Windows application. When the application is configured to receive files, it launches a web server. This web server allows for remote browsing of the file system via HTTP requests if the device is connected to the wifi network with the default password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The web server does not require any authentication or authorization to access the file system information, allowing anyone connected to the WiFi network to browse files.
*   **Information Exposure:** The server exposes file system information through HTTP requests, revealing directory structures and file names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can remotely browse the file system of the machine running the vulnerable SHAREit instance. This allows the attacker to see the directory structure and file names, which can lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. An attacker must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the machine running the vulnerable SHAREit application.
*   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the SHAREit web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network as the victim.
*   The attacker needs to know the IP address of the victim's machine running the SHAREit service.
*   The attacker needs the default Wi-Fi password ("12345678") to connect to the hotspot created by SHAREit.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/list` endpoint on the SHAREit web server.
*   The `path` parameter in the request specifies the directory to browse (e.g., `C:\Users\admin`).
*   The server responds with a JSON object containing information about the files and directories within the specified path.
