CVE Name: CVE-2016-1491, CVE-2016-1490, CVE-2016-1489, CVE-2016-1492

3. Vulnerability Description

SHAREit [1] is a free application from Lenovo [2] that lets you easily share files and folders among smartphones,
tablets, and personal computers.

Lenovo SHAREit for Windows and Android are prone to multiple vulnerabilities which could result in integrity
corruption, information leak and security bypasses.

4. Vulnerable Packages

Lenovo SHAREit for Android 3.0.18_ww
Lenovo SHAREit for Windows 2.5.1.1
Other products and versions may also be affected, but they were not tested.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Lenovo released an updated version of Lenovo SHAREit for Windows and Android that fix the reported issues.

The new version of the products can be found here [1].

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Ivan Huertas from Core Security Consulting Team. The publication of
this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core Security Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1. Hard-coded password in Lenovo SHAREit for Windows

[CVE-2016-1491] When Lenovo SHAREit for Windows is configured to receive files, a Wifi HotSpot is set with an easy
password (12345678). Any system with a Wifi Network card could connect to that Hotspot by using that password. The
password is always the same.

7.2. Remote browsing of file system on Lenovo SHAREit for Windows

[CVE-2016-1490] When the WiFi network is on and connected with the default password (12345678), the files can be
browsed but not downloaded by performing an HTTP Request to the WebServer launched by Lenovo SHAREit. The following
request was used to perform this action:

POST /list?type=file&path=C%3A%5CUsers\admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Dalvik/1.6.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.4.4; XT1032 Build/KXB21.14-L1.40)
Host: 192.168.173.1:2999
Connection: Keep-Alivek
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 0
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Length: 2426

","type":"file","ver":""}],"filepath":"C:\\Users\\admin","has_thumbnail":false,"id":"C:\\Users\\admin","isloaded":true,"isroot":false,"isvolume":false,"name":"admin","type":"file","ver":""}

7.3. Files transferred in plain text in Windows and Android version of Lenovo SHAREit

[CVE-2016-1489] The files are transfered via HTTP without encryption. An attacker that is able to sniff the network
traffic could to view the data transferred or perform man in the middle attacks, for example by modifying the content
of the transferred files.

7.4. Open WiFi Network defined on Android devices

[CVE-2016-1492] When the application is configured to receive files, an open Wifi HotSpot is created without any
password. An attacker could connect to that HotSpot and capture the information transferred between those devices.
