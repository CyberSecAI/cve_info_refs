Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how ClamAV processes a crafted "mew packer executable". The specific flaw is not described in detail, but the vulnerability is triggered when ClamAV attempts to parse a specially crafted file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed input: ClamAV's parsing logic for mew packer executables is vulnerable to a crafted input that causes a crash. The provided information suggests a lack of proper input validation, leading to memory corruption or other undefined behaviors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a crash, resulting in a denial-of-service. This would make ClamAV unavailable for scanning files, impacting systems that rely on it for malware detection.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: Although the primary impact is a crash, the Ubuntu security notice mentions "possibly execute arbitrary code". This suggests that the underlying flaw could potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks depending on the specific nature of the memory corruption. However, this is not confirmed and it seems to be a possible scenario rather than a certainty.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted malicious file: The vulnerability is triggered by scanning a specially crafted mew packer executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious file to ClamAV: The attacker needs to be in a position to provide a malicious file to be scanned by ClamAV. This could be achieved in a number of ways:
   - Email gateway: By sending a malicious attachment via email that is scanned by ClamAV.
   - File scanning: By placing the crafted file on a system where ClamAV is configured to scan files.
   - Web server: By uploading a file to a web server that is scanned using ClamAV.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing using AFL, a common method for uncovering software vulnerabilities by providing random or semi-random input to the target application.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ClamAV version 0.99.2
- The blog post mentions that "attackers would be isolated by the ClamAV AppArmor profile" in the default installation, this does not mean the vulnerability isn't exploitable but just that some systems are more hardened.
- The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description, providing information about the affected file type, and the method used to discover the vulnerability.
