Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Cisco AsyncOS for the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) handles a specific HTTP response code. This improper handling leads to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of HTTP response codes resulting in memory exhaustion.
- Lack of proper resource management, specifically not freeing TCP connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the appliance.
- The appliance runs out of system memory, leading to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP response to the appliance.
- Unauthenticated access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco WSA.
- No authentication is required, making it easily exploitable remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific HTTP response code.
- An accumulation of TCP connections that are not freed is an indicator of compromise, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.
- A workaround involves using a diagnostic command to restart the proxy process.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a support case.
- Snort rule 38958 is available to detect exploitation attempts.
- The provided CVSS score is Base 7.1, Temporal 5.9, with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C, indicating a network-based attack with moderate complexity and complete impact on availability.
