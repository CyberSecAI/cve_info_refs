For more information, see in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver Administration Guide](../../driver_admin/data/bktitle.html#bktitle).

##### Mutual Authentication between the Remote Loader and Identity Manager Engine

This release introduces support for configuring mutual authentication between the Remote Loader and the Identity Manager engine for additional security. This authentication mechanism uses certificates for mutual handshake instead of passwords. The Remote Loader and the Identity Manager engine authenticate each other by exchanging and validating their signed certificates. For more information, see [Configuring Mutual Authentication with the Identity Manager Engine](../../setup/data/t41gjsb7rje7.html#t41gjsb7rje7) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).

##### Support for New Actions for Creating Roles and Resources in Designer

This release adds support for building role and resource creation actions in Designerâs Policy Builder. For more information, see [Create Role](../../policy_designer/data/createrole.html#createrole) and [Create Resource](../../policy_designer/data/createresource.html#createresource) and in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Using Designer to Create Policies](../../policy_designer/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

##### Identity Vault Supports eDirectory 9.0.2 and 8.8.8 SP9 and Later Versions

This release provides support for eDirectory 9.0.2 or later in addition to eDirectory 8.8.8 SP9 as an Identity Vault. For more information, see the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).

##### Support for Suite B

This release includes support for Suite B algorithms for Identity Manager components. Suite B is a set of cryptographic algorithms standardized by the National Security Agency (NSA) to allow commercial products to protect traffic that is classified at secret or top secret levels. The Suite B algorithms ensure the security of classified and unclassified information passed through public networks. For more information about Suite B, see [Suite B Cryptography](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/index.shtml).

You can configure Suite B secured communication between the Identity Manager engine and the Remote Loader or Fan-Out agent. For more information, see [Configuring Stronger Ciphers for SSL Communication](../../driver_admin/data/t41w06l45k4v.html#t41w06l45k4v) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver Administration Guide](../../driver_admin/data/bktitle.html#bktitle). Support for Suite B is included in eDirectory 9.0 and later versions.

*IMPORTANT:*Suite B standard is subject to change. Suite B support in Identity Manager is based on our interpretation of the NSA recommendation. Be aware that NSA may change their recommendation in future.

##### Activating Identity Manager with DirXML Command Line Utility

This release provides support for activating Identity Manager using the DirXML command line utility in addition to iManager. For more information, see [Activating Identity Manager](../../setup/data/t42j6d2z0wjh.html#t42j6d2z0wjh) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).

##### Subscriber Service Channel

Identity Manager introduces Subscriber Service Channel that enables you to separately process the out-of-band queries without interrupting the normal flow of cached events. For example, the Subscriber service channel can separately process code map refresh, data collection, and queries triggered from dxcmd. This helps to improve the performance of the driver. This functionality can be controlled by a new Engine Control Value, Enable Subscriber Service Channel. This feature is currently available for use with the JDBC Fan-Out driver only.

##### Nashorn Script Engine

This release includes support for Nashorn ECMAScript engine. To use the Nashorn scripting engine, change the default setting by using the Use Rhino ECMAScript engine control value.

For more information, see [Engine Control Values](../../driver_admin/data/b94psjw.html#b94psjw) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver Administration Guide](../../driver_admin/data/bktitle.html#bktitle).

#### Reporting and Auditing with Sentinel Log Management

In this release, Sentinel Log Management for Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) replaces the Event Auditing Service (EAS). For your convenience, the Identity Manager 4.6 installation kit includes an installation program for Sentinel Log Management for IGA. For more information, see [Installing and Managing Sentinel Log Management for Identity Governance and Administration](../../setup/data/t42h8dhcsunb.html#t42h8dhcsunb) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).

When you upgrade to version 4.6, you can migrate your existing data from EAS to Sentinel Log Management for IGA after installing this component. For more information, see [Migrating from Event Auditing Service to Sentinel Log Management for IGA](../../setup/data/b1b60ryd.html#t428snrlsjhl) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).

#### Simplified Upgrade for Identity Applications and Supporting Components

For your convenience, the Identity Manager 4.6 installation kit includes an upgrade program for upgrading the identity applications and the supporting software such as OSP, SSPR, Tomcat, JDK, and ActiveMQ. For more information, see [Upgrading Identity Applications and Supporting Components](../../setup/data/t428q5h2aqb4.html#t428q5h2aqb4) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).

#### Single ISO for Identity Manager Advanced and Standard Editions

Identity Manager 4.6 provides both Advanced and Standard Editions in a single ISO instead of separate ISO files. To understand what features are provided with each edition, see [Section 4.1, Features Supported with Identity Manager Advanced and Standard Editions](#t429de91mq2k).

This change does not affect the existing licensing model. Identity Manager continues to provide separate licenses for Advanced and Standard Editions. For more information about licensing and activation, see [Understanding Licensing and Activation](../../setup/data/b16ysnju.html#b16ysnju) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).

For new installations, you can configure Identity Manager as Advanced Edition or Standard Edition based on the choice you specified during Identity Manager engine installation. For continued use of features, you must apply the appropriate license keys.

#### Convenience Bundling of Identity Manager Components

In addition to providing the complete Identity Manager functionality in one ISO file, NetIQ delivers various Identity Manager components in separate ISO files in convenient packages.

The convenience bundling option enables you to download only the required components for your installation. For detailed information about the ISO files provided with Identity Manager 4.6, see [Section 4.0, Installing NetIQ Identity Manager 4.6](#b149h4pw).

### 1.2 Whatâs Changed, Deprecated, or Discontinued?

To streamline functionality, several items have changed or are no longer supported with Identity Manager 4.6. In many cases, alternative functionality replaces the items that are no longer supported.

#### Changed Functionality or Features

The following list provides an overview of the features or functions that have changed or deprecated in this release or will soon be deprecated.

Separate Access to Identity Manager Home and the Identity Manager Provisioning Dashboard

This release introduces the Dashboard, which includes the functionality previously provided by Identity Manager Home and Provisioning Dashboard. Instead of using Home and Provisioning Dashboard, you must use the new user interface. For example, if you attempt to edit Featured Items in Home, you will be directed to the new Dashboard.

If you are upgrading to this release, please ensure that your users have the updated URLs to access the identity applications in the Dashboard. Also, add your Featured Items to Dashboard > Applications. For more information about adding featured items, see the Help for the Dashboard.

This release continues to support Home and Provisioning Dashboard. However, that functionality is redundant, so it will be deprecated in the future.

Fan-Out Agent

The Fan-Out agent is now available with the Identity Manager installation package instead of the Fan-Out driver. For information about using the Fan-Out agent with the JDBC Fan-Out driver, see [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver for JDBC Fan-Out Implementation Guide](../../../identity-manager-46-drivers/jdbc_fanout/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

Version Numbers Not Displayed in the Splash Screens of the Identity Manager Installation Programs

The Identity Manager installer splash screens no longer display the version number of the component being installed. However, you can find the version information in the Introduction or Pre-installation Summary page of the installer.

#### Discontinued or Deprecated Functionality

The following list provides an overview of the features or functions that have been discontinued from this release or will soon be deprecated.

Event Auditing Service

Event Auditing Service is discontinued from this release. The .iso file includes an installation program for Sentinel Log Management for IGA.

### 4.5 Installation Prerequisites

The following considerations apply when you install this version:

* To install the Identity Manager components using the component installers, install the components in the following order:

  1. eDirectory
  2. Sentinel Log Management for IGA
  3. iManager
  4. Identity Manager Engine
  5. Apache Tomcat and PostgreSQL

     Identity Manager provides a convenience installer to install these components.
  6. OSP
  7. SSPR
  8. Identity applications (not required for Standard Edition)
  9. Designer
  10. Identity Reporting
  11. Analyzer

  You can install the components interactively or silently.

  For information about which component can be installed on which operating system, see [Selecting an Operating System Platform for Identity Manager](../../setup/data/b1bkyfvh.html#b1cckr3q) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).
* Before starting the installation process on a supported RHEL platform, verify that the platform has the necessary libraries required for installing Identity Manager. On a 64-bit platform, the required libraries vary depending on your chosen method of installation. In absence of the dependent libraries, manually install the libraries before starting the Identity Manager installation. For more information, see [Installing Identity Manager on RHEL 6.x or 7.x Servers](../../setup/data/b16mybwd.html#b16mybwd) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).
* For a guided installation of Identity Manager on SLES 12 SP1 or later platforms by using the components installers or the integrated installation program, verify that the platform has the necessary libraries already installed. The installation does not start in absence of these libraries. For more information, see [Installing Identity Manager on SLES 12 SP1 or Later Servers](../../setup/data/t42k1xggym0r.html#t42k1xggym0r) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).
* The following considerations apply to using the integrated installation program:

  + Can be run on RHEL 7.3 or later and SLES 12 SP1 or later Linux platforms in addition to the supported Windows platforms.
  + Cannot not be used to install Identity Manager on RHEL 6.x and SLES 11.x platforms. Instead, use the individual component installers to install the supported components on these platforms. For information about which components are supported on which platforms, see the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front).
  + Should not be used to install Identity Manager Standard Edition

    For guidelines about installing the Identity Manager components for Standard Edition, see the [Quick Start Guide for Installing and Upgrading NetIQ Identity Manager 4.6 Standard Edition](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-manager-46/quick_start_se/data/quick_start_se.html).
  + Should not be used in a clustered environment
  + Should not be used in a production environment
* Before installing Identity Manager 4.6 Standard Edition, ensure that the container where the reportAdmin role resides does not include any object with the same name.

### 4.6 Installing NetIQ Identity Manager 4.6

Before installing Identity Manager 4.6, NetIQ recommends that you review the information in the following sections in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front):

* Interaction among Identity Manager components: [Introduction](../../setup/data/b16s52ia.html#b16s52ia)

  This section describes the components that you might want to install for your identity management solution.
* Planning your Identity Manager environment: [Planning to Install Identity Manager](../../setup/data/b19fw3wm.html#b19fw3wm)

  This section provides a checklist and scenarios for installing Identity Manager. It also describes the prerequisites and system requirements for the computers where you want to install each Identity Manager component.
* Deciding the type of installation for your environment: [Understanding the Integrated and Standalone Installation Processes](../../setup/data/b1b6kilz.html#b1b6kilz)

  The integrated installation program bundles Identity Manager components so you can avoid the need to separately install each component. This program bundles the latest versions of all necessary components for Identity Manager for your convenience. Use this process for a test environment or for evaluating Identity Manager.

Depending on the edition you are installing, review the information from one of the following resources:

* Advanced Edition: [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide](../../setup/data/front.html#front)
* Standard Edition: [Quick Start Guide for Installing and Upgrading NetIQ Identity Manager 4.6 Standard Edition](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-manager-46/quick_start_se/data/quick_start_se.html).

##### Cannot Specify Installation Paths on Windows that Include Spaces

The standalone installation programs for Identity Manager might not place the installation files in the specified location if the path contains spaces. Ensure that the specified path does not contain any spaces. (Bug 620797)

##### Engine Installation is Not Started Due to Mismatch in libXrender Libraries on RHEL and SLES Platforms

*Issue:*
A mismatch in libXrender libraries occurs if your operating system doesâ not have a 32-bit libXrender library.

*Workaround:*
Install libXrender1-32bit RPM.

##### Pop-up Window is Displayed When Engine is Silently Installed

*Issue:*
The silent installation program for the Identity Manager Engine displays a pop-up window while installing the platform agent components. (Bug 900781)

*Workaround:*
This does not cause any impact on the installation.

##### LDAP Server Displays an Error While using VLV and SSS Controls

*Issue:*
When you configure an LDAP search to use VLV (Virtual List View) and SSS (Server Side Sort) controls and the LDAP server does not hold a local copy of the user objects, the search fails with an error.

*Workaround:*
Store the user objects into your local replica to use VLV and SSS controls. For more information see the TID [7001493](https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7001493).

##### Empty Remote Loader Installation Folder on Windows

*Issue:*
Sometimes the Remote Loader installation program does not place the necessary Remote Loader files in the installation folder.

This issue has been randomly observed on both 32-bit and 64-bit Remote Loaders on Windows.

*Workaround:*
Reinstall Remote Loader. (Select only Remote Loader option during the installation.)

##### Remote Loader Trace Screen does not Close after Restart

*Issue:*
After restarting the Remote Loader server, and you stop the Remote Loader instance on Windows 2012 R2 platform for the first time, it does not close the trace screen but the driver is stopped.

*Workaround:*
In the Service panel, set the DirXML service to Autostart (Delayed).

##### Incorrect Representation of Index Values in iMonitor

*Issue:*
While viewing index values such as Path attributes in iMonitor, iMonitor fails to display the correct values of the attributes.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time. It is safe to ignore this issue as it does not cause any functionality loss. (Bug 1023742)

##### Identity Applications Installer Does Not Create master-key.txt File in the File System During Installation

*Issue:*
The identity applications installer prompts you to create a new master key or import it to the file system. If you create a new master key, the installer fails to create the master-key.txt file in the <UserApp-install> directory on Tomcat. (Bug 900240)

*Workaround:*
Use the master key value from ism-configuration.properties file. The master key value is required while setting up Tomcat clustering.

##### Tables are Not Created if ConfigUpdate Utility is Launched Right After Installing Identity Applications

*Issue:*
While installing the identity applications, if you select the option for creating tables at startup and do not start the application, but rather launch configupdate and click OK, the com.netiq.idm.create-db-on-startup setting is set to false. Because you have not actually started the application, the tables are not created. This issue causes the startup to fail because the tables do not exist. (Bug 900284)

*Workaround:*
Open ism-configuration.properties, change the value from false to true, save the file, and then restart the application.

##### Identity Applications Silent Properties File Contains Incorrect Entry for Microsoft SQL Server

*Issue:*
The silent properties file for the identity applications in the ISO-root/RBPM/user\_app\_install directory has an incorrect example for Microsoft SQL Server, as shown below:

```
================================================
# Leave the quotes in place. Valid values:
# MySQL
# Oracle
# MS SQL Server
# PostgreSQL
NOVL_DB_TYPE=
=================================================
```

The entry shown is MS SQL Server, but the correct entry is Microsoft SQL Server. (Bug 900939)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Some Installation Wizards Display an Incorrect Icon for Components

*Issue:*
The Tomcat and PostgreSQL convenience installer displays a Java icon instead of displaying an icon for Tomcat and PostgreSQL components. This issue is also observed in One SSO Provider (OSP).

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Navigation Panel is Truncated in Identity Reporting Installer

*Issue:*
In some languages, the navigation panel that appears on the left side of the installation program for Identity Reporting appears truncated. You might not be able to see all of the Navigation panel names. (Bug 899888)

*Workaround:*
You can safely ignore the truncated navigation panel and continue with the installation.

##### Installation Programs Provide Examples for Linux Instead of Windows

*Issue:*
The installation programs provide examples for most settings that you are required to specify. Some of the examples might be for a Linux platform, even when you install on a Windows server. Ensure that you specify values that work for Windows. (Bug 896265)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Filter Resource Changes Are Not Automatically Applied to the Package

*Issue:*
If a driver contains a package that includes a filter resource, any changes made to the filter resource are not reflected in the driver filter. For example, when a new class or an attribute is added to the filter, the changes are not merged with the driver filter. (Bug 1103241)

*Workaround:*
Manually synchronize the changes with the package.

1. In the Outline view, right-click the filter resource and select Sync to Package.
2. Select the package where you want to add the filter resource and click OK.

#### Identity Manager Engine Issues

* [Unable to Execute Large ECMAScripts](#t422d8eees5g)
* [Password Synchronization Status Attribute Not Updated when a New User is Migrated](#t4292zy1nfsa)
* [Increased Length of the OSP Attribute Value Causes Login Issues](#t42ibhrk0lli)

##### Unable to Execute Large ECMAScripts

*Issue:*
This issue is caused by Rhino engine's inability to parse very large scripts.(Bugs 1016963, 942241)

*Workaround:*
Identity Manager 4.6 supports Nashorn ECMAScript engine. Use this scripting engine for executing large ECMAScripts. For more information, see [Engine Control Values](../../driver_admin/data/b94psjw.html#b94psjw) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver Administration Guide](../../driver_admin/data/bktitle.html#bktitle).

For information about moving to Nashorn scripting engine, see the [Rhino Migration Guide](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Nashorn/Rhino%2BMigration%2BGuide).

##### Password Synchronization Status Attribute Not Updated when a New User is Migrated

*Issue:*
When a new user is migrated from the Identity Vault, the password synchronization status attribute of the user is not updated with the password synchronization status. (Bug 1021792)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time. When the password is changed again, the attribute is correctly updated.

##### Increased Length of the OSP Attribute Value Causes Login Issues

*Issue:*
If you do not log out after every successful login into the identity applications, the value of the OSP attribute gradually increases after multiple logins. The increased length of the value causes login issues.

*Workaround:*
Perform any one of the following approaches to resolve this issue:

Manually clear the value of the OSP attribute in iManager.

1. Log in to iManager.
2. In View Objects, select the user object.
3. In Other tab, double-click oidInstanceData attribute and clear the value.

Or,

Decrease the Refresh token lifetime value in configupdate utility:

1. Launch the configudate utility.
2. Select the Authentication tab.
3. In Authentication Configuration, decrease the Refresh token lifetime (hours) value.

#### Remote Loader Issues

* [Cannot Generate Audit Events for 32-Bit and 64-Bit Remote Loaders on the Same Server](#t42f9slowswy)
* [A Few Packages Remain Uncleaned after Upgrading a 32-Bit Remote Loader to 64-Bit Remote Loader](#t42f9slox0mq)
* [Remote Loader Installation Program Adds Driver Files to Two Separate Directories](#b1dk8nwb)
* [Installing the Remote Loader by using the Standalone and the Integrated Installers on the Same Windows Computer Is Not Supported](#b1dk8nwe)
* [Connection Between Remote Loader 4.5.3 and Identity Manager 4.6 Engine Fails](#t41yzm1bizt0)

##### Cannot Generate Audit Events for 32-Bit and 64-Bit Remote Loaders on the Same Server

*Issue:*
Although you can install both a 32-bit and a 64-bit Remote Loader on the same computer, the lcache files for these versions cannot work concurrently. The audit events are logged to the lcache file for the version that you installed first. The log file for the other version displays the message: Agent already running error. (Bug 676310)

*Workaround:*
Do not install both versions on the same computer.

##### A Few Packages Remain Uncleaned after Upgrading a 32-Bit Remote Loader to 64-Bit Remote Loader

*Issue:*
When a 32-bit Remote Loader 4.5 is upgraded to a 64-bit Remote Loader 4.6, the upgrade process does not clean the following 32-bit 4.5 packages:

* novell-DXMLbase-4.5.0-0
* novell-DXMLgw-3.5.4-20131120
* novell-DXMLrdxml-4.5.0-0
* novell-NOVLjvml-4.5.0-0

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Remote Loader Installation Program Adds Driver Files to Two Separate Directories

*Issue:*
On Windows, the standalone and integrated installation programs install the Remote Loader in separate directories. The integrated installer installs all components including the Remote Loader in the c:\netiq directory. The standalone installer installs the Remote Loader in the c:\novell directory. If you are using the integrated installer and then select a driver shim, the driver shim defaults to c:\novell, which is not the correct directory. This issue causes the driver shim to fail. (Bug 908466)

*Workaround:*
In the Remote Loader console, manually change the default installation path of the Remote Loader from c:\novell to c:\netiq if you installed it using the integrated installer. Ensure that you do not install the Remote Loader using the standalone installer and the integrated installer on the same Windows computer.

##### Installing the Remote Loader by using the Standalone and the Integrated Installers on the Same Windows Computer Is Not Supported

*Issue:*
Identity Manager does not support installing the Remote Loader by using the integrated installer and the standalone installer on the same computer. This is an unsupported configuration and creates driver errors. (Bug 908466)

*Workaround:*
Install the Remote Loader using the integrated installer and the standalone installer on separate Windows computers.

##### Connection Between Remote Loader 4.5.3 and Identity Manager 4.6 Engine Fails

*Issue:*
You cannot establish an SSL connection between Remote Loader 4.5.3 and Identity Manager 4.6 engine. (Bug 1010680)

*NOTE:*This issue is observed only when a native Identity Manager driver uses Remote Loader. An example of a native driver is Identity Manager driver for Active Directory.

*Workaround:*
Depending on the eDirectory version you are using, you can re-establish the connection in one of the following ways:

* *eDirectory 8.8.8.x:*
  Do one of the following:

  + Modify the Remote Loader configuration in the driver properties and add secureprotocol=TLSv1 to it. For example, hostname=ipaddress port=8090 kmo="SSL CertificateDNS" secureprotocol=TLSv1.
  + Upgrade Remote Loader to 4.6 version.
* *eDirectory 9.0.1 or later:*
  Upgrade Remote Loader to 4.6 version.

#### Driver Issues

You might encounter the following issues as you use the Identity Manager drivers:

* [Statistics Report Shows Zero for Role and License Values for an Office 365 Driver](#b1c8dii7)
* [Remote Loader Instance of a Driver Might Fail to Start If the Default Width of Windows Command Prompt Window is Changed](#b1ct0b3n)
* [dxcmd Query with Huge Output is Executed Twice](#t41yxnp87hsn)
* [Issue with Adding DirXML Accounts Entry When a User is Migrated](#t422n1v3nodt)
* [Driver Cache Inspector is Unable to Display the Last Entry in the Cache List](#t42dm00jovy4)
* [JMS Driver Fails to Start Due to Conflicting Jar Files](#t42gzig5p38w)
* [Remedy Driver Does Not Start When Run Locally with the Identity Manager Engine](#t42o2k04jl4j)

##### Statistics Report Shows Zero for Role and License Values for an Office 365 Driver

*Issue:*
The Statistics report for the Office 365 driver shows zero for Role and License values in the Assigned Entitlements Per Type section because of a limitation in the Office 365 driver. (Bug 893248)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Remote Loader Instance of a Driver Might Fail to Start If the Default Width of Windows Command Prompt Window is Changed

*Issue:*
If you change the width of the Windows command prompt window from the default value, the driver instance might fail to start and it does not record any trace information. (Bug 854488)

*Workaround:*
Reset the width of the Windows command prompt window to the default value of 80.

##### dxcmd Query with Huge Output is Executed Twice

*Issue:*
When you issue a dxcmd command to a driver for processing a query, by default the Identity Manager engine waits 120 seconds for a response from the driver. If there is no response, the engine retries the query after the timeout. If there is no response after another 120 seconds, the engine displays ERR\_TRANSPORT\_FAILURE error. This results in the driverâs processing the query twice. (Bug 1014581)

*Workaround:*
Set the environment variable NCPCLIENT\_REQ\_TIMEOUT to a value greater than the time expected to execute the query.

##### Issue with Adding DirXML Accounts Entry When a User is Migrated

*Issue:*
When a user is migrated from the Identity Vault with a driver without entitlements packages, Identity Manager does not populate a value for the DirXML-Accounts attribute for the user. This issue occurs when the information for the user is same in both connected application and the Identity Vault. (Bug 1016682)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Driver Cache Inspector is Unable to Display the Last Entry in the Cache List

*Issue:*
On web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, the Driver Cache Inspector does not display the last entry in the driver cache list.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Expand all the cache entries in the list by selecting Actions > Expand All from the main menu.
2. Use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate to any expanded entry from the list.

##### JMS Driver Fails to Start Due to Conflicting Jar Files

*Issue:*
On Linux platform, the JMS driver fails to start due to the location of conflicting Jar files.

*Workaround:*
Copy the jms.jar from dirxml/classes to jre/lib/ext which is loaded first. (1000741)

##### Remedy Driver Does Not Start When Run Locally with the Identity Manager Engine

*Issue:*
When the driver is configured to run locally with the Identity Manager engine, the driver fails to start due to a conflicting JAXB API included in the activemq-all-5.14.jar file and reports the following error message in the trace:

```
com.sun.xml.internal.ws.spi.db.DatabindingException: Unknown JAXBContext implementation: class com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.JAXBContextImpl
```

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Install the driver with the Remote Loader.
2. Remove the activemq-all-5.14.jar file from the lib folder of the Remote Loader installation directory.
3. Start the driver.

#### Identity Reporting Issues

You might encounter the following issues when you use Identity Reporting:

* [Extended Attributes Table Does Not Reflect Removal of Extended Attributes](#b1bk3qs9)
* [Cannot Modify the Frequency of a Schedule](#b1bk3qse)

##### Extended Attributes Table Does Not Reflect Removal of Extended Attributes

*Issue:*
If you remove an attribute that was added to the Data Collection Service driver filter policy, Identity Manager does not remove the attribute from the extended attributes table (idmrpt\_ext\_attr, which tracks the attributes). Also Identity Manager does not remove data from the idmrpt\_ext\_item\_attr table. (Bug 633209)

*Workaround:*
You must update the database based on your configuration:

* When a custom attribute or an attribute on an extended object is removed from the DCS Driver filter:

  For example, you use the attribute named srvprvCapabilities1

  ```
  UPDATE idm_rpt_data.idmrpt_ext_item_attr
  SET idmrpt_syn_state = 0
  WHERE attribute_id =
    (SELECT attribute_id FROM idm_rpt_data.idmrpt_ext_attr WHERE attribute_name = 'srvprvCapabilities1');
  ```
* When you remove an extended object from the DCS Driver filter:

  For example, you use the object named Device

  ```
  UPDATE idm_rpt_data.idmrpt_ext_item_attr attr
  SET idmrpt_syn_state = 0
  WHERE EXISTS
    (SELECT 1 FROM idm_rpt_data.idmrpt_ext_idv_item item, idm_rpt_data.idmrpt_ext_obj obj WHERE item.object_id = obj.object_id and attr.cat_item_type_id = 'EXTIDVOBJ' and attr.cat_item_id = item.item_id and object_class = 'Device')

  UPDATE idm_rpt_data.idmrpt_ext_idv_item
  SET idmrpt_syn_state = 0
  WHERE object_id =
    (SELECT object_id FROM idm_rpt_data.idmrpt_ext_obj WHERE object_class = 'Device');
  ```

##### Cannot Modify the Frequency of a Schedule

*Issue:*
You cannot change the frequency of a schedule. For example, from week to month. (Bug 677430)

*Workaround:*
To change the frequency, delete the schedule and create a new one.

#### iManager Plug-In Issues

You might encounter the following issues as you use iManager:

* [Exception on Windows 2016 When Using KMO](#t42ia5xj5kyd)
* [Dependency on NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard](#b1bk3qsu)
* [Some Actions Are Not Available in Policy Builder Plug-In](#t4238fkcozis)
* [Images Created by the Driver Set Dashboard Plug-In Are Not Removed After Leaving the Plug-In](#t42sn52goblw)

##### Exception on Windows 2016 When Using KMO

*Issue:*
When you export a CA certificate in a .b64 format from iManager, a blank line is added at the end of the certificate. This makes the certificate invalid. (Bug 1018732)

*Workaround:*
Manually remove the blank line from the certificate.

##### Dependency on NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard

*Issue:*
iManager needs the NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard for proper functioning.

*Workaround:*
To use the NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard, download and install the iManager plug-in for NetIQ Certificate Server.

##### Some Actions Are Not Available in Policy Builder Plug-In

*Issue:*
This release does not support building the following actions by using Policy Builder in iManager.(Bug 1018354)

* Create role
* Create resource
* Add resource
* Remove resource
* Generate XDAS event

*Workaround:*
To build these actions, use Policy Builder in Designer.

##### Images Created by the Driver Set Dashboard Plug-In Are Not Removed After Leaving the Plug-In

*Issue:*
Identity Manager temporarily creates the graphic files used by the Identity Manager Overview and Driver Set Dashboard plug-ins in the <iManager Install Folder>/nps/images/temp directory. (Bug 1002940)

The files created by the Driver Set Dashboard plug-in are not cleaned when you leave the plug-in or when Tomcat is stopped.

*Workaround:*
Manually remove the file from the directory.

#### Identity Manager Upgrade Issues

* [Upgrading from Identity Manager 4.5 to 4.6 Deletes CA Certificates](#b1bk3qtv)
* [Progress Indicator Shows Truncated Directory Names for Some Components During Upgrade](#t42dzth529ge)
* [Upgrade Process Fails due to Missing Port Values in the URL](#t42o35haodti)

##### Upgrading from Identity Manager 4.5 to 4.6 Deletes CA Certificates

*Issue:*
The upgrade program replaces the old JRE folder but deletes all custom certificates from the folder. For example, the certificates are placed in the /opt/novell/eDirectory/lib64/nds-modules/jre/lib/security/cacerts directory on 64-bit Linux platforms. (Bug 794590)

*Workaround:*
Complete the following steps:

1. Save the CA certificates in a custom location.
2. Upgrade Identity Manager 4.5 to 4.6.
3. Copy the certificates back to the JRE directory depending on your platform.

After the upgrade, verify the JRE version is 1.8.0\_112.

##### Progress Indicator Shows Truncated Directory Names for Some Components During Upgrade

*Issue:*
While upgrading OSP, SSPR, and the identity applications components, the installation directory names for these components appear truncated in the progress indicator.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Upgrade Process Fails due to Missing Port Values in the URL

*Issue:*
If the port numbers are not specified in the OSP Oauth redirect URL parameter for each identity application, the upgrade process fails.

*Workaround:*
Before launching the upgrade program, you must manually enter the port numbers in Configuration Update utility. Perform the following steps to specify the port values:

1. Launch the Configuration Update utility.
2. In SSO Clients tab, specify the appropriate port values in all the required URLs.

   Use the following format: protocol://server:port/path

##### SSPR Does Not Prompt to Set Security Questions in the First Login

*Issue:*
This issues occurs when you log in to the identity applications with a user name containing a white space. (Bug 1025713)

*Workaround:*
Replace the white space with an underscore '\_' in the user name before logging in to the application for the first time.

##### Dashboard Displays Erroneous Count of Total Users

*Issue:*
The following issues are reported:

* When you add users and immediately refresh the view, the Dashboard lists the new users but does not update the count of total users. However, the updated total count of users is correctly displayed if you refresh the view after a few seconds.
* If a user has multiple values for either the given name or sn, the Dashboard shows different values for Search Count and Total Count. (Bug 1006448)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Pop-up Windows Might Display Contents in a Mix of Browser and Client Default Languages

*Issue:*
When you perform an action that opens a pop-up window, the Dashboard might display a section of the window contents in the clientâs language instead of the browserâs language. For example, viewing the details for a task opens a pop-up window. This issue occurs in Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge browsers after the user changes the browserâs language to one that is not the clientâs default language. (Bug 1019020)

*Workaround:*
After changing the browserâs language, close the current tab. Then open a new tab to log in to the Dashboard.

##### Request and Approval Workflow Forms Have Right-Aligned Field Labels

*Issue:*
When accessing Request and Approval forms in the Dashboard, form field labels are right-aligned. (Bug 921403)

*Workaround:*
To make the form field labels on Request and Approval workflows align from the left, add the following statement to each form's onload event:

```
$("div.nv-formFieldLabel").parent().css("text-align", "left");
```

##### CLE Restricted Browser Blocks Access to the Forgotten Password Page

*Issue:*
When you restrict access to websites but whitelist the Landing page for the identity applications, CLE Restricted Browser might block access to the Forgotten Password page for Self Service Password Reset. Users might see the following error:

```
"Access is restricted to your Target Server"
```

(Bug 1021647)

*Workaround:*
In the whitelist, add the URL to the Forgotten Password page.

Also, if you upgrade from Identity Manager 4.5, update the link to Landing to direct users to the new Dashboard (/idmdash/#/landing) instead of Identity Manager Home (/landing) in the SSPR redirect URL section.

##### Catalog Administrator Changes Focus after Creating a New Role or Resource

*Issue:*
After you create a role or a resource, Catalog Administrator does not maintain the user interface focus on that role or resource. Maintaining focus on the new role or resource allows you to more easily manage that role or resource. Instead, Catalog Administrator changes the focus to the first role or resource in the list.

*Workaround:*
To manage a role or resource, scroll down or search the catalog.

##### Access Role and Resource Administration Requires Full Permissions

*Issue:*
Accounts that do not have full permission for role and resource administration cannot access Catalog Administrator. The user cannot be a delegated administrator or have permission for only one domain.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Cannot Change Revoke Process from Quorum to Serial

*Issue:*
If you change the revoke approval process from quorum to serial approval, the approval process does not change as expected.

*Workaround:*
Change the approval process from quorum to none, and then change it to serial. Be aware that when you change the process from quorum to none, all associated approvers are lost, so ensure that you take note of the approvers and associate them to the process after you change it from none to serial.

##### Cannot Display Dynamic Fields when a Resource is Mapped to a Role

*Issue:*
For resources that require fields to be supplied with values when the resource is requested, Catalog Administrator does not display the fields when you map the resource to a role.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Copying Text in the Detail Portlet Displays an Error Message

*Issue:*
In Firefox or Dojo, if you attempt to copy text in the Detail portlet, an error message is displayed. (Bug 604174)

The following sequence of events cause this message to appear:

1. Log in to the User Application as administrator and go to the Administration tab.
2. Click Portlet Admin > Detail Portlet in Portlet Applications.
3. Click Preferences > View/Edit custom Preferences > continue.
4. Click the HTML Layout edit icon and enter some sample text, such as TEST.
5. Select the text and click Copy.

If you follow these steps, you see the following error message:

```
"Exception... "Access to XPConnect service
denied"  code: "1011" nsresult: "0x805303f3
(NS_ERROR_DOM_XPCONNECT_ACCESS_DENIED)"  location:
"http://111.11.1.11:8180/IDMProv/resource//portal-general/javascript/html_editor.js
Line: 531" " when clicked on Copy button.
```

You might also see this message when performing cut and paste operations.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Content for the User Application Driver is Missing Trustees for Attestation Reports

*Issue:*
If you redeploy the User Application driver from Designer after running the integrated installation program, the trustees for the Attestation Report provisioning request definitions are deleted and no one can execute the report. This issue occurs because the trustees are added to the Attestation Report provisioning request definitions when the User Application starts. Because Designer does not know about the trustees, an attempt to redeploy the User Application driver from Designer removes the trustees. (Bug 641781)

*Workaround:*
After starting the User Application, import these objects from eDirectory to synchronize the trustees.

##### PostgreSQL Does Not Support Number Format of Simplified Chinese

*Issue:*
PostgreSQL does not install successfully if you install PostgreSQL on a server that is set up with Simplified Chinese as the number format (by using Control Panel > Clock, Language, and Region > Region and Language > Formats tab > Format > Chinese, Simplified,PRC). (Bug 683839)

*Workaround:*
Ensure that the Simplified Chinese Number format is changed on the server where you are installing PostgreSQL.

##### Can Approve or Deny a Role Request after the Role has been Deleted

*Issue:*
If an administrator deletes a role that requires a workflow after a user has made a role request, the workflow addressee for the role request still sees the workflow in the Task List and is able to approve or deny the request. (Bug 752860)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Creating and Copying the Base Package for the User Application Drivers causes Roles Based Provisioning Module to Fail

*Issue:*
When you perform certain operations on the User Application base package that you created, such as removing the role configuration object, it causes RBPM to fail. (Bug 879595)

*Workaround:*
NetIQ recommends that you do not create or copy the User Application driver base package.

##### Database Generation with the SQL File Produces an Erroneous Failure Message

*Issue:*
When you use a SQL file to generate the schema in the Identity Applications database, the process attempts to create two database changelog tables. The second attempt fails because the table already exists.

*Workaround:*
Ignore the error message. (Bug 896919)

##### Cannot Start a Password for a User Application Account with the < Character

*Issue:*
You cannot use the special character â<â as the first character in a password for the User Application. For example, <testing12. The browser interprets the password as badly formatted HTML text, and the user cannot log in. (Bug 759297)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Log File Reports Irrelevant Errors after a Successful Installation

*Issue:*
Although identity applications are successfully installed, the NetIQ-Custom-Install.log file displays the following errors:

```
ERROR: log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration).
```
```
ERROR: log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
```

*Workaround:*
Do not take any action for these errors because the installation was successful. (Bug 898228)

##### Home Postal Address Is Not Correctly Displayed in the User Application

*Issue:*
If you populate a userâs home postal address in iManager using the Other tab, the User Application view of this address contains extra characters (delimiters). The Identity Manager User Application does not support the Postal Address Syntax (0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.39). (Bug 900613)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### Issues in iPad iOS 6 Safari Browser

The following issues have been observed on Safari browser on iOS 6. No such issues are reported on other browsers, such as Chrome and Safari on iOS 7.

Fails to Display Navigation Items in Portrait Mode

*Issue:*
If you are running the identity applications using Safari on an iPad that is in portrait orientation, the header navigation items do not always display properly.

*Workaround:*
To display the header navigation item, select a navigation item on the left.

New Resource Button Does Not Work when Private Mode Setting is Disabled

*Issue:*
The New Resource button does not work if the private mode setting is disabled. (Bug 867530)

*Workaround:*
Enable the private mode setting on the browser before attempting to create a new resource.

Separation of Duties Editor Fails to Load the SoD Form in the Right Panel

The SoD editor does not load the SoD form.(Bug 867528)

Map Resources Button does not Work

The Map Resources button does not work as expected. (Bug 867526)

##### Home and Provisioning Dashboard Issues

The following issues occur in the Home and Provisioning Dashboard. Note that this feature will be deprecated in future. Please use the Dashboard introduced with this release.

Identity Manager Home and Provisioning Dashboard do not Support Digital Signatures in Workflows

*Issue:*
The Identity Manager Home and Provisioning Dashboard do not currently support Request or Approval provisioning request definitions and workflows that require digital signatures.

*Workaround:*
To request or approve a resource, and if your form requires a digital signature, use the User Application user interface to perform the action. (Bug 855367)

Provisioning Dashboard Displays all Possible Values for Valued Entitlements

If you use the Provisioning Dashboard to request a resource associated with a valued entitlement, the value field does not filter entitlements based on what you enter. Instead, the value field displays all the possible values for the entitlement, regardless of what you enter in the field. (Bug 857911, Bug 857829)

Workflows Report an Error when Using dateToString for Timestamp Control

*Issue:*
Workflows that you created in the User Application and that use the form script method dateToString for a timestamp do not function appropriately in Identity Manager Home. The dateToString form script in the API includes seconds, while the new Date/Time control in Identity Manager Home does not. The new script uses a different format. To ensure that your forms function with Identity Manager Home, you must replace dateToString with the new script: new Date ().toString ('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime').

*Workaround:*
To replace the control for a single date in your form, you might use the following code:

```
document.getElementById('%Field-Name').value = new Date().toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime');
```

However, you might need to replace controls that represent two dates. For example, you might have a form requiring that the user specify a start and end time for an entitlement request.

To specify startDate, use the following type of code:

```
document.getElementById('_startDate').value = new Date().toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime');
```

To specify an endDate that occurs three days after the starting date, use the following type of code:

```
var s = new Date().getTime();
  s = s + 3 * 1000 * 24 * 60 * 60;
  document.getElementById('_furDate').value = new Date(s).toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime');
```

In this example, the workflow responds with the following information:

```
startDate: 3/14/2014 12:03 PM
endDate: 3/17/2014 12:03 PM
```

*NOTE:*In the above codes, if you want to use only DatePicker in your form you can exclude 'Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime' from the code.

For example, if you want to specify only date for startDate, you can use following type of code:

document.getElementById('\_startDate').value = new Date().toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate');

Email Approval Failure Notification is Displayed in Identity Manager System Language For Already Processed Tasks

The Provisioning Dashboard sends an email approval failure notification in the system language instead of the specified language for the already processed tasks. (Bug 1024491)

Duplicate Email Responses When Email Service Protocol is Changed

*Issue:*
The Provisioning Dashboard sends duplicate email responses for already processed emails if you switch the email service protocol from IMAP to POP3 or vice-versa. (Bug 1024688)

*Workaround:*
Clear the processed emails from the incoming email server before switching the email service protocol.

##### Oracle 12c Database Creation Might take a Long Time

*Issue:*
In this release, creating an Oracle 12c database takes significantly longer than creating databases in previous releases. The creation does not time out if there is no problem with the database creation, so plan for the extra time.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### User Application Navigation Items are Not Displayed When Using Safari on an iPad

*Issue:*
If you are running the User Application using Safari on an iPad that is in portrait orientation, the header navigation items do not always display properly.

*Workaround:*
To display the header navigation item, select a navigation item on the left.

##### Customized CSS does not Synchronize with the Cluster Nodes

*Issue:*
In Identity Manager Dashboard, when you upload the customized CSS in the cluster, CSS changes are not applied on all the cluster nodes. (1025836)

*Workaround:*
Ensure that each node in the cluster has the same copy of CSS in the following location:

```
<user home directory>/netiq_custom_css
```

##### ClientAbortException While Logging Out of the User Applications on Windows

*Issue:*
If you try to list users either by selecting Identity Manager Dashboard > People > Users or by selecting Manage Users and then log out of the identity applications before Dashboard displays the total count of users in the browser, this process generates a ClientAbortException exception in the catalina.out file. This exception can also occur in the following cases while working with the identity applications:

* The browser window is closed.
* Network is disconnected.
* Session has timed-out.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time. It is safe to ignore this exception as it does not cause any functionality loss.

##### Role and Resource Service Driver Does Not Support Recalculation of Roles, Resources, and DirXML-EntitlementRef Attribute for a User

*Issue:*
If you resynchronize a user in the Role and Resource Service driver, the driver checks the user attributes in the filter and synchronizes them, but it does not recalculate the roles and resources assigned to the user. (Bug 1093450)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

##### catalina.out File Does Not Rotate the Log

*Issue:*
If you installed Identity Applications on Linux or Windows, the catalina.out file does not rotate the log.

*Workaround on Linux:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Open a text editor and create a netiq-tomcat file at /etc/logrotate.d/ with the following entries:

   ```
   /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out {
           copytruncate
           daily
           dateext
           dateformat -%Y-%m-%d
           rotate 25
           notifempty
           missingok
           compress
          su novlua novlua
   }
   ```
2. Verify that logrotate is scheduled to run at midnight.
3. Verify that novlua user and novlua group permissions are set for the catalina.out file.
4. Verify that the log is correctly rotated.

   Run the following command:

   /usr/sbin/logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/netiq-tomcat

   You should see messages similar to the below in the screen.

   ```
   reading config file /etc/logrotate.d/netiq-tomcat
   Handling 1 logs
   rotating pattern: /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out after 1 days (25 rotations)
   empty log files are not rotated, old logs are removed
   switching euid to 485 and egid to 0
   considering log /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
   log does not need rotating
   switching euid to 0 and egid to 0
   ```

*Workaround on Windows:*
There is no workaround at this time.

### 6.3 Standard Edition Issues

* [Delimited Text Driver Loops Endlessly on a Publisher Channel Event when Permission Collection and Reconciliation Service is Enabled](#b1e9x1cs)
* [Reporting Admin Role Must Exist Before Beginning Identity Manager Standard Edition Reporting Installation](#t433czgnwtce)

#### Delimited Text Driver Loops Endlessly on a Publisher Channel Event when Permission Collection and Reconciliation Service is Enabled

*Issue:*
The Permission Collection and Reconciliation Service (PCRS) functionality is not supported in the Standard Edition. This issue might occur in Standard Edition when PCRS is enabled. When there is a change in an event in the Publisher channel, it causes a change in one or more permission attributes defined in the custom entitlements (.csv file). The driver keeps checking for the creation of the resources and loops endlessly. (Bug 907031)

*Workaround:*
Disable PCRS.

#### Reporting Admin Role Must Exist Before Beginning Identity Manager Standard Edition Reporting Installation

If you install Identity Reporting using the Identity Manager Standard Edition installation, the Report Admin role must exist before you start the installation process.

*Workaround:*
If you completed the installation without creating the Report Admin role, run the Configuration Update utility (configupdate.sh) to create the role.
