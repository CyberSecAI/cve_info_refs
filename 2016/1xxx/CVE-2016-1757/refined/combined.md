**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=676

tl;dr
The code responsible for loading a suid-binary following a call to the execve syscall invalidates
the task port after first swapping the new vm_map into the old task object leaving a short race window
where we can manipulate the memory of the euid(0) process before the old task port is destroyed.

******************

__mac_execve calls exec_activate_image which calls exec_mach_imgact via the image activator table execsw.

If we were called from a regular execve (not after a vfork or via posix_spawn) then this calls load_machfile
with a NULL map argument indicating to load_machfile that it should create a new vm_map for this process:

  if (new_map == VM_MAP_NULL) {
    create_map = TRUE;
    old_task = current_task();
  }

it then creates a new pmap and wraps that in a vm_map, but doesn't yet assign it to the task:

    pmap = pmap_create(get_task_ledger(ledger_task),
           (vm_map_size_t) 0,
           ((imgp->ip_flags & IMGPF_IS_64BIT) != 0));
    pal_switch_pmap(thread, pmap, imgp->ip_flags & IMGPF_IS_64BIT);
    map = vm_map_create(pmap,
        0,
        vm_compute_max_offset(((imgp->ip_flags & IMGPF_IS_64BIT) == IMGPF_IS_64BIT)),
        TRUE)

the code then goes ahead and does the actual load of the binary into that vm_map:

  lret = parse_machfile(vp, map, thread, header, file_offset, macho_size,
                        0, (int64_t)aslr_offset, (int64_t)dyld_aslr_offset, result);

if the load was successful then that new map will we swapped with the task's current map so that the task now has the
vm for the new binary:

    old_map = swap_task_map(old_task, thread, map, !spawn);

    vm_map_t
    swap_task_map(task_t task, thread_t thread, vm_map_t map, boolean_t doswitch)
    {
      vm_map_t old_map;

      if (task != thread->task)
        panic("swap_task_map");

      task_lock(task);
      mp_disable_preemption();
      old_map = task->map;
      thread->map = task->map = map;

we then return from load_machfile back to exec_mach_imgact:

  lret = load_machfile(imgp, mach_header, thread, map, &load_result);

  if (lret != LOAD_SUCCESS) {
    error = load_return_to_errno(lret);
    goto badtoolate;
  }

  ...

  error = exec_handle_sugid(imgp);

after dealing with stuff like CLOEXEC fds we call exec_handle_sugid.
If this is indeed an exec of a suid binary then we reach here before actually setting
the euid:

       * Have mach reset the task and thread ports.
       * We don't want anyone who had the ports before
       * a setuid exec to be able to access/control the
       * task/thread after.
      ipc_task_reset(p->task);
      ipc_thread_reset((imgp->ip_new_thread != NULL) ?
           imgp->ip_new_thread : current_thread());

As this comment points out, it probably is quite a good idea to reset the thread, task and exception ports, and
that's exactly what they do:

  ...
  ipc_port_dealloc_kernel(old_kport);
  etc for the ports
  ...

The problem is that between the call to swap_task_map and ipc_port_dealloc_kernel the old task port is still valid, even though the task isn't running.
This means that we can use the mach_vm_* API's to manipulate the task's new vm_map in the interval between those two calls. This window is long enough
for us to easily find the load address of the suid-root binary, change its page protections and overwrite its code with shellcode.

This PoC demonstrates this issue by targetting the /usr/sbin/traceroute6 binary which is suid-root. Everything is tested on OS X El Capitan 10.11.2.

In our parent process we register a port with launchd and fork a child. This child sends us back its task port, and once we ack that we've got
its task port it execve's the suid-root binary.

In the parent process we use mach_vm_region to work out when the task's map gets switched, which also convieniently tells us the target binary's load
address. We then mach_vm_protect the page containing the binary entrypoint to be rwx and use mach_vm_write to overwrite it with some shellcode which
execve's /bin/zsh (because bash drops privs) try running id in the shell and note your euid.

Everything is quite hardcoded for the exact version of traceroute6 on 10.11.2 but it would be easy to make this into a very universal priv-esc :)

Note that the race window is still quite tight so you may have to try a few times.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Welcome!

Reverse engineering and security for fun since 2007. Enjoy browsing around!
## Flare-On 2024 Challenge #5 - sshd

Flare-On 2024 is gone and I just made a presentation about the challenge #5 at the local meetup called 0xOpoSec. I think itâs a nice challenge to introduce a few RE and forensics concepts, and a perfect candidate to present this year.
The slides are available here, and the Unicorn Engine emulator I used to extract the flag from the final shellcode here.
Last year I did the same with challenge #12, also with a Unicorn Engine emulator....

## Abusing Go's infrastructure

I apologize if this information is already known, but I couldnât find any references about it and I wanted to understand what was going on and share with you because I think there is some value doing it.
In case this wasnât known, I apologize to the Go team for not talking to them first and jumping the full disclosure gun (I donât think itâs that severe). I really like Go!...

## Attacking the heart of an OpenRG modem

Note: the original post was written in 2017 when there werenât many posts discussing direct attacks to firmware flash. It also took a while to get in touch with the ISP to give them a chance to fix some of the issues described (in particular the ACS access) and then it was left in draft mode until today. I just made a quick revision and fixed quite a few dead links....

## Knock Knock! Who's There? - An NSA VM

Back in 2017 (feels like ages ago) I decided to take a peek into the ShadowBrokers leaks and reverse some of the tools.
I started on dewdrop simply because it had a macOS version. I made local presentations at 0xOpoSec and BSidesLisbon but those slides were never published for obvious reasons (aka live implants all over the Internet).
Significant time has passed and everyone went crazy last week with the beautiful NSO exploit VM published by Project Zero, so why not ride the wave and present a simple NSA BPF VM. It is still an interesting work and you have to admire the great engineering that goes behind this code. Itâs not everyday that you can take a peek at code developed by a well funded state actor.
This post is only going to focus on the BPF part of the implant so you will have to fill in the blanks about everything else.

## How to build a custom and distributable lldb

Almost two years ago (when covid was just starting and we all happily ignored it) I wrote a post about implementing x86 hardware breakpoints in lldb. This critical debugger feature was missing from lldb. Probably because lldb main users are developers and not serious reverse engineers (lol!) dealing with malicious code and/or just reversing/cracking hostile software protections (cracking is the best and most fun RE target practice).
The build process described in that post worked but I wasnât very happy with it - not easily portable between macOS systems. Some time ago I tried to fix it but I gave up since I wasnât in the mood to deal with build systems problems.

# Mach Race OSX - Local Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### 39741

Mach Race OS X Local Privilege Escalation Exploit

(c) fG! 2015, 2016, reverser@put.as - https://reverse.put.as

A SUID, SIP, and binary entitlements universal OS X exploit (CVE-2016-1757).

Usage against a SUID binary:

./mach_race_server /bin/ps _compat_mode

for i in seq 0 1000000; do ./mach_race_client /bin/ps; done

Against an entitled binary to bypass SIP:

./mach_race_server /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/system_shove _geteuid

for i in seq 0 1000000; do ./mach_race_client /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/system_shove; done

Note: because the service name is not modified you can't chain this exploit from user to root and then use it to bypass SIP since bootstrap_register2 will fail the second time (service is already registered with launchd from the first run). The solution is to add a parameter to use a different service name for example.

Note2: there's no need to make this into two separate apps, a single binary works, you just need to fork a server and client.

http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.pt/2016/03/race-you-to-kernel.html

Tested against Mavericks 10.10.5, Yosemite 10.10.5, El Capitan 10.11.2 and 10.11.3.

Fixed in El Capitan 10.11.4.

Should work with all OS X versions (depends if bootstrap_register2 exists on older versions).

Alternative implementation with bootstrap_create_server possible for older versions.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
