Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly restrict access permissions within the EC-CUBE's IP restriction functionality for the administrative interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper access control: The system does not adequately enforce IP-based restrictions on access to the administrative login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Bypassing IP restrictions: A remote attacker can circumvent the configured IP address restrictions.
- Unauthorized access: By bypassing the IP restrictions, the attacker can reach the administrative login page, potentially leading to further unauthorized actions if login is successful (although not directly a part of this vulnerability).
- Exposure of login page: The vulnerability exposes the login page to unauthorized individuals who could attempt to brute-force their way in or try other credential-based attacks if they reach the login page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network access: The attack is performed remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the target system.
- No prior authentication or user interaction required.
- No specific privileges needed.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is rated as "low" severity by the vendor and "medium" by JVN, based on CVSS scores.
- The vulnerability affects EC-CUBE versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.9.
- Multiple remediation options are provided, including upgrading to a newer version (3.0.10 or later), applying a patch file, or manually applying code changes.
