Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-1522:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in `Code.cpp` within the `Libgraphite` library, specifically how it handles recursive load calls during size checks. The code fails to properly account for recursive calls when loading font data, leading to potential buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper bounds checking during recursive calls when loading context items in a font, allowing more data to be written into a buffer than allocated. This can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*  **Out of bounds read:** When interpreting opcodes, the interpreter doesn't check if the instruction pointer remains within allocated memory bounds after a skip instruction. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read.
* **Null pointer dereference:** A null pointer deference can occur when loading a font via `grmakefile_face`. If the `readFeats` function returns true without initializing the variables in `mFeatureMap`, a null pointer deference can occur when `grmakeseg` is later called.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerabilities can cause the application using Libgraphite to crash, leading to a denial of service. This includes Firefox, LibreOffice and other applications.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The heap-based buffer overflow, out-of-bounds read and  null pointer dereference vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited, can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. This is because the out of bounds read causes the TTF virtual machine to execute attacker-controlled code.
*   **Information Leak:** An out-of-bounds read can lead to leaking sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted Graphite smart font:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted Graphite smart font. This font can be served over the network (e.g., via a compromised web server) or delivered locally.
*  **User interaction:** Requires a user to open a document or render a page that uses the crafted font.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious font:** An attacker must be able to create a font with specific opcodes to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **Ability to get a user to use the crafted font:** The attacker needs to find a way to make a user use an application that uses `Libgraphite` (like a browser or office suite) to parse their malicious font. This could be done through social engineering, by compromising a server, or sending an attachment.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects applications using Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, including Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x versions prior to 38.6.1.
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 fixed this issue with the version update to graphite2 1.3.1 during the LibreOffice 5.0 feature update, but without a specific CVE assigned at the time.
*   Red Hat fixed this vulnerability in firefox via RHSA-2016:0197 and then in graphite2 via RHSA-2016:0594.
*   Gentoo addressed this vulnerability in graphite2 version 1.3.7
* Talos has released rules to detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities.
