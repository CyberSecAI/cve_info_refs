Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1774:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Time Machine server in OS X Server 5.1 had an issue where it did not properly warn administrators if permissions were ignored when performing a server backup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Lack of proper warnings to administrators about ignored permissions during server backups.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An administrator may unknowingly store backups on a volume without the necessary permissions enabled. This could lead to data being backed up to locations where it might not be secure or accessible as intended.

**Attack vectors:**
- This vulnerability is not directly exploited by an attacker. Instead, it is a misconfiguration issue that arises due to the software's inadequate warning system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker position or capability is required since it's a configuration issue. However, an administrator performing a backup operation is the affected party.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix for this issue involved implementing improved warnings.
