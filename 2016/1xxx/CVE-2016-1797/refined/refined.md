Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the sandbox policy of the `fontd` process in Apple OS X.
- The issue is a failure to properly ensure the `FontValidator` binary is either excluded from the policy or is sandboxed itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Escape:** The primary weakness is the ability to escape the sandbox of the `fontd` process.
- **Improper Sandboxing:** The `FontValidator` binary, which should be sandboxed or excluded from the `fontd` sandbox policy, was not properly handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code outside of the Safari sandbox context, which could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to execute code outside the sandbox can be leveraged to gain higher privileges.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** With arbitrary code execution capabilities, attackers could potentially steal sensitive data or manipulate system settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely (though not directly by network alone).
- **Chained Exploitation:** This vulnerability is likely used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve full code execution. Specifically, the advisory mentions it can be used with "other vulnerabilities" to escape the Safari sandbox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:**  Although not directly stated, the attacker would need to be able to get code execution inside of the Safari sandbox. This would likely be accomplished via a crafted website, or other method that allows remote access to cause the vulnerable code path to be executed.
- **Chained vulnerability knowledge:** Attackers need to be aware of other vulnerabilities to exploit this sandbox escape effectively.
- **Basic understanding of OS X sandboxing:**  Knowledge of how OS X sandboxing and process execution works are needed to construct a working exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "lokihardt" working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Apple has released a security update to address this vulnerability.
