  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Shoplat App for iOS fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper SSL certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can establish a connection to a server using an invalid SSL certificate without the user being warned. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept communications without the user's knowledge.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack via a malicious wireless LAN access point"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the app and the server, such as by operating a malicious Wi-Fi access point."
