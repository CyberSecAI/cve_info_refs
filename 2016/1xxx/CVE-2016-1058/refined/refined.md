Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader DC handles tool events. Specifically, a specially crafted `ToolEventHandler` can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. This leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The core vulnerability is a use-after-free, where a pointer is accessed after the memory it points to has been deallocated. This is a classic memory corruption issue.
- Dangling Pointer: The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted `ToolEventHandler` causes a pointer to become dangling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Adobe Reader DC. This means the attacker can gain control over the user's machine.
- System Takeover: The ability to execute arbitrary code enables an attacker to perform various malicious actions, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF File: An attacker can embed the malicious `ToolEventHandler` within a specially crafted PDF document. When the user opens this PDF with a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader, the exploit can be triggered.
- Malicious Web Page: An attacker can also host the malicious PDF document on a web page. When a user visits this page with a vulnerable Adobe Reader environment, the exploit can be triggered. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious web page).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote: The attacker can be remote, exploiting the vulnerability by delivering the crafted PDF document via web or email.
- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction, such as opening the crafted PDF or visiting a malicious website hosting the PDF.
- Knowledge of Vulnerability: The attacker needs to have the understanding to create the malicious `ToolEventHandler` to trigger the use-after-free.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of the HPE Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe released security updates to address this vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and Macintosh.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "critical" by Adobe, indicating a high severity level.
- The ZDI advisory assigned the vulnerability a CVSS score of 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
