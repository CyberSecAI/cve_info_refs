Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a path traversal flaw in the Netgear NMS300 management system. Specifically, the `realName` parameter within the `/data/config/image.do?method=add` endpoint is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `realName` parameter, enabling an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions and access files outside of the web application's root directory.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An authenticated attacker can use the path traversal vulnerability to access and download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This may include sensitive configuration files, credentials, or other critical data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/data/config/image.do?method=add` endpoint with a malicious `realName` parameter.
- After this, an authenticated user is required to send a POST request to /data/getPage.do?method=getPageList&type=configImgManager to obtain the file id. 
- Finally, a GET request to `/data/config/image.do?method=export&imageId=<ID>` is sent to download the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the NMS300 web interface to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the NMS300 server.
