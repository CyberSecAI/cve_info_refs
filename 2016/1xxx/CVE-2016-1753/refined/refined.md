Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to multiple integer overflows within the kernel.
- Specifically, the issue lies in the failure to properly validate user-supplied input for potential integer overflows within the `IOGeneralMemoryDescriptor` interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Integer overflow: The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation that leads to integer overflows. This can cause unexpected behavior and memory corruption issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges, potentially gaining kernel-level access.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker with kernel privileges can execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, effectively taking complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- User Interaction: User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, as a target must open a malicious file or perform some action that triggers the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Local User: The attacker must have a local user account on the target system.
- Ability to trigger the vulnerability: The attacker must have the means to cause the vulnerable code to be executed, typically by opening a specially crafted file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple by Juwei Lin of Trend Micro, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Patches have been released by Apple to address the issue by improving input validation.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Apple products such as:
    - iOS
    - watchOS
    - tvOS
    - OS X
