Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the web-based management interface of specific Cisco routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a classic example of a CWE-79 vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS attack:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject malicious script into the web interface.
- **Compromise of user sessions:** The injected script could potentially steal cookies or other sensitive information, or be used to perform actions within the interface as the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Network-Based:** The attack is launched remotely over the network, targeting the vulnerable web interface.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to execute the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router.
- **Knowledge of Target URL:**  The attacker needs to know where to inject the malicious script on the vulnerable router's web interface.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need credentials to conduct the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected products are Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewalls, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Routers, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Routers.
- The web-based management interface is available through a local LAN or, if enabled, via remote management.
-  The CVSS base score is 4.3, and the temporal score is 4.1, indicating moderate severity.
- A fixed software release is available to address the issue.
