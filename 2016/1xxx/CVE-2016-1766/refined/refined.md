Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-1766:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate the certificate chain when handling signed MDM profiles in Apple iOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Certificate Chain Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper checks on the certificate chain, allowing a malicious or untrusted profile to appear as verified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **MDM Profile Spoofing:** An attacker can craft an MDM profile that appears to be trusted by the system, which can have various impacts such as:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By making a malicious profile appear trusted, a remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable iOS device.
    *   **Malicious Configuration:** The attacker could install a malicious MDM profile that manipulates device settings, installs malicious apps, or redirects network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely, and an attacker doesn't need physical access to the target device.
*   **User Interaction Required:**  The target user needs to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file for the exploitation to occur. This file could contain a crafted MDM profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver a crafted MDM profile to the victim, which can be achieved via malicious websites or file distribution.
*  **Ability to forge a malicious MDM profile:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious MDM profile that exploits the certificate validation weakness.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Apple by Taylor Boyko working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Apple released a security update (iOS 9.3) to address this issue by implementing additional certificate validation checks.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 10.0, highlighting its critical severity
