| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1283934#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-11-20 10:29:50 UTC  ``` Qemu emulator built with the TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows guests support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference flaw. It occurs while doing I/O port write operations via hmp interface. In that, 'current_cpu' remains null, which leads to the null pointer dereference.  A user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance, resulting in DoS issue.

Subject: CVE request Qemu: i386: null pointer dereference in vapic_write

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

    Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows guests
support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference flaw. It occurs while
doing I/O port write operations via hmp interface. In that, 'current_cpu'
remains null, which leads to the null pointer dereference.

A user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance, resulting in
DoS issue.

Upstream patch:
- ---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-01/msg02812.html>

Reference:
- ----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1283934>

This issue was discovered by Mr Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.

Thank you.

    Device support is vulnerable to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion), that could occur when receiving large packets.

CVE-2015-7504

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a heap-based buffer overflow that could result in
    denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code
    execution.

CVE-2015-7512

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a buffer overflow that could result in denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2015-8345

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the eepro100
    emulator contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop when
    processing Command Blocks, eventually resulting in
    denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8504

    Lian Yihan of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the VNC display
    driver support is vulnerable to an arithmetic exception flaw that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8558

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the USB EHCI
    emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite
    loop during communication between the host controller and a device
    driver. This could lead to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion).

CVE-2015-8743

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
    vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
    resulting in information leak or memory corruption.

CVE-2016-1568

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI
    emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1714

    Donghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration
    emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write
    access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1922

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests
    support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u12.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

## [Qemu-devel] [PULL] i386: avoid null pointer dereference

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

When I/O port write operation is called from hmp interface,
'current_cpu' remains null, as it is not called from cpu_exec()
loop. This leads to a null pointer dereference in vapic_write
routine. Add check to avoid it.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a full virtualization
solution on x86 hardware.

CVE-2015-7295

    Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc. discovered that the Virtual Network
    Device support is vulnerable to denial-of-service, that could
    occur when receiving large packets.

CVE-2015-7504

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a heap-based buffer overflow that could result in
    denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code
    execution.

CVE-2015-7512

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a buffer overflow that could result in denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2015-7549

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360
    Inc. discovered that the PCI MSI-X emulator is vulnerable to a
    null pointer dereference issue, that could lead to
    denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8345

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the eepro100
    emulator contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop when
    processing Command Blocks, eventually resulting in
    denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8504

    Lian Yihan of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the VNC display
    driver support is vulnerable to an arithmetic exception flaw that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8550

    vulnerable to double fetch vulnerabilities, possibly resulting in
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2015-8558

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the USB EHCI
    emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite
    loop during communication between the host controller and a device
    driver. This could lead to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion).

CVE-2015-8567 CVE-2015-8568

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the vmxnet3 device
    emulator could be used to intentionally leak host memory, thus
    resulting in denial-of-service.

CVE-2015-8613

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the SCSI MegaRAID
    SAS HBA emulation support is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer
    overflow issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash).

CVE-2015-8619

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the Human Monitor
    Interface support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound write access
    issue that could result in denial-of-service (via application
    crash).

CVE-2015-8743

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
    vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
    resulting in information leak or memory corruption.

CVE-2015-8744

   The vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes small packets, which could
   result in denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8745

   The vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes Interrupt Mask Registers,
   which could result in denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2016-1568

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI
    emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1714

    Donghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration
    emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write
    access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1922

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests
    support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2016-1981

    The e1000 driver is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u5a.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
