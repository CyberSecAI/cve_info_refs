  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the QEMU emulator when built with TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows guests support. The vulnerability occurs during I/O port write operations via the HMP interface. The 'current_cpu' value remains null because it's not called from the cpu_exec() loop.",

        "Null pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with access to the HMP interface can crash the QEMU instance, leading to a denial-of-service.",

        "I/O port write operations via HMP interface"
