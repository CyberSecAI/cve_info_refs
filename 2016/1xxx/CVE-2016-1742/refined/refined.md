- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A dynamic library loading issue existed in the iTunes setup process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure dynamic library loading. The iTunes installer was susceptible to loading libraries from untrusted directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. By placing a malicious DLL in a location that iTunes would search, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the iTunes installer.
- **Attack vectors**: Running the iTunes installer from an untrusted directory. An attacker could place a malicious DLL in a directory searched by the installer and entice a user to execute the installer from that location.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location searched by the iTunes installer and convince a user to execute the installer from this location.
