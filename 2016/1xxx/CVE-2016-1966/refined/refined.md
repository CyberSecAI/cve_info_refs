Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1966:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A memory corruption issue in the NPAPI (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) subsystem. This involves a dangling pointer dereference within the `nsNPObjWrapper::GetNewOrUsed` function, triggered by specific interactions with a malicious plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Use-after-free (specifically a dangling pointer dereference) in the NPAPI subsystem.
*   Memory corruption due to the use of a dangling pointer.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a combination of crafted NPAPI plugin and scripted web content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability may lead to application crashes due to memory corruption.
*   **Privilege escalation**: In some specific contexts (unpacked addons with signing disabled), an attacker could gain additional privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability in conjunction with a maliciously crafted NPAPI plugin.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered through a browsing context (e.g., Firefox or Thunderbird with Javascript enabled). It can not be exploited in Thunderbird through email by default because Javascript is disabled there.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to craft a malicious NPAPI plugin**: The attacker needs to create a custom plugin that interacts with the vulnerable code in a specific way.
*   **Ability to deliver crafted content**:  The attacker needs to get the user to open specially crafted web pages containing Javascript which interacts with the malicious plugin.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is a regression of a previously fixed issue (Bug 445229), where an incorrect assumption was made regarding the purpose of a variable assignment related to the handling of NPAPI objects.
*   The fix involves reinstating the assignment which was previously removed.
*   The issue was initially reported by the UK's CESG.
*   The vulnerability requires a specially crafted NPAPI plugin to trigger, thus increasing the complexity of a potential attack, as noted in some reports as having a "medium" complexity.
