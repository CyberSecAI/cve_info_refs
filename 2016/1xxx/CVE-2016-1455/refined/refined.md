Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the internal `iptables` configuration for local interfaces on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. The `iptables` configuration is not correctly set up, allowing access to certain sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive data due to misconfigured `iptables` rules.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The `iptables` misconfiguration leads to an improper access control, which allows unauthorized access.
*   **CWE-200:** The advisory explicitly states that this vulnerability is related to CWE-200, which is "Information Exposure."

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Sensitive Data:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information.
*   **Reconnaissance Attacks:** The attacker could use the disclosed information to conduct further reconnaissance attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker. This means no prior access or valid credentials are required to initiate an attack.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker can access the vulnerable device through network connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS (Standalone) mode running Cisco NX-OS Software Releases prior to 7.0(3)I2(2e) and 7.0(3)I4(1) are vulnerable.
*   **Workaround:** An ACL can be applied to the configured local interfaces to restrict access to the unwanted ports.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N). The Temporal score is 4.1 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C).
*   **Exploitation:** Functional exploit code is available.
*   **Vendor Confirmation:** The vulnerability is confirmed by Cisco.
