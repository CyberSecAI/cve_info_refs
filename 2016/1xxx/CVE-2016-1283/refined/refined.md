{
  "CVE-2016-1283": {
    "Root cause": "The `pcre_compile2` function in `pcre_compile.c` in PCRE mishandles specific patterns with named subgroups, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to mishandling of named subgroups in regular expressions.",
      "Improper handling of recursive back references.",
       "Lack of proper input validation"

    "Impact": "Denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow), potentially arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted regular expressions, such as those embedded in JavaScript RegExp objects.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to supply a specially crafted regular expression. The vulnerability is triggered during compilation of the regular expression.",
     "More Details": "The vulnerability stems from how PCRE handles patterns with named subgroups, particularly those involving recursive backreferences or forward references to duplicate group numbers. The issue was introduced in version 8.34 with refactored named group handling code."
