CVE-2016-1006:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Adobe Flash Player that allows attackers to bypass the ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) protection mechanism.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: ASLR bypass
- Impact of exploitation: Allows attackers to bypass ASLR, which can be a prerequisite for exploiting other memory corruption vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted SWF file, which can be delivered via a website or other means.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SWF file to the victim, which can be done by hosting it on a website or embedding it in an email or document. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

CVE-2016-1011:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution
- Attack vectors: Unspecified vectors in Adobe Flash Player.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted SWF file. This can be achieved by hosting the file on a website, or embedding it into an email message or a document. User interaction is required.

CVE-2016-1012:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Memory corruption in Adobe Flash Player.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- Attack vectors: Unspecified vectors in Adobe Flash Player.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted SWF file. This can be achieved by hosting the file on a website, or embedding it into an email message or a document. User interaction is required.

CVE-2016-1013:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution
- Attack vectors: Unspecified vectors in Adobe Flash Player.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted SWF file. This can be achieved by hosting the file on a website, or embedding it into an email message or a document. User interaction is required.
