Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-1359:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the log file handling of Cisco Prime Infrastructure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper handling of log files allows an attacker to modify the system log file.
- The modified log file could include executable code which would be executed when the log file is viewed. This is a classic example of a log injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious code into the log file.
- This would allow the attacker to compromise the system and execute arbitrary commands.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attacker must be authenticated.
- The attack is performed remotely via network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
- The attacker must be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable software to modify the log files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided CVSS vector string is `AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C` which translates to:
    - Access Vector: Network (AV:N)
    - Access Complexity: Low (AC:L)
    - Authentication: Single (Au:S)
    - Confidentiality Impact: Partial (C:P)
    - Integrity Impact: Partial (I:P)
    - Availability Impact: Partial (A:P)
    - Exploitability: Functional (E:F)
    - Remediation Level: Official Fix (RL:OF)
    - Report Confidence: Confirmed (RC:C)
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time the advisory was published.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Infrastructure version 3.0.
- There are no workarounds available and users should upgrade their Cisco Prime Infrastructure version.
