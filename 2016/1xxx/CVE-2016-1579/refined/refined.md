The provided content is related to CVE-2016-1579.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of unconfined applications to execute post-processing commands within the `ubuntu-download-manager`. This likely means that the `ubuntu-download-manager` was not properly restricting which applications could trigger the execution of post-processing commands, allowing unconfined apps to potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper access control on the execution of post-processing commands.
- Allowing unconfined apps to trigger privileged operations.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `ubuntu-download-manager` application by using a malicious unconfined application. This could result in a compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:** A malicious unconfined application could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the `ubuntu-download-manager` to trigger the execution of arbitrary post-processing commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to install and run an unconfined application on the target system.
