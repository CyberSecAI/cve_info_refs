Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Jetstar App for iOS fails to properly verify SSL server certificates. This means the app does not validate the authenticity of the server it is communicating with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper SSL certificate validation within the iOS application. This allows the app to connect to potentially malicious servers without raising any security concerns.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** A successful MitM attack allows an attacker to intercept and eavesdrop on encrypted communication between the Jetstar App and its server. This can expose sensitive data transmitted by users such as personal information, login credentials, and booking details.
*   **Eavesdropping:** Attackers can decrypt the communication and get access to the exchanged data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The primary attack vector is a network-based MitM attack. This typically involves the attacker placing a malicious wireless access point or intercepting network traffic between the user and the legitimate server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Positioning:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, typically by being on the same network as the victim or by controlling the network infrastructure (e.g., a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot).
*   **MitM capabilities:** The attacker needs the technical skills and tools to perform a MitM attack by intercepting and possibly modifying communication between the victim's device and the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the Jetstar App for iOS prior to v3.0.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Yuta TESHIMA of Cyber Defense Institute, Inc. to IPA.
*   JPCERT/CC coordinated with the vendor to address the vulnerability.
*   CVSS v3 score is 4.8 (Medium) and CVSS v2 is 4.0 (Medium)
