Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/04/stable-channel-update_13.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, April 13, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 50 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 50.0.2661.75 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/49.0.2623.112..50.0.2661.75?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 50.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [20 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M50+type%3Dbug-security&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[602697](https://crbug.com/602697)] CVE-2016-1659: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

## Issue [1642283002](/1642283002/): Deal with frame removal by content scripts (Closed)

Consequently, extension code (content scripts, chrome.app.window.create) that run arbitrary code in the "document element created" and "document loaded" notifications may result in unexpected invalidation of memory, resulting in a UAF. This patch fixes the bug by moving all code that runs untrusted code from observers to dedicated callbacks, which are only run at a safe point. All document parsers in Blink have been modified to make sure that they still work even when the document creation is interrupted by frame removal. An extensive set of tests for all different kinds of documents, frame removal methods (e.g. synchronously / in mutation events / ...) and injection points (document start/end) have been added to avoid regressions.

ImageDocument is just an implementation detail, web/extension devs just see a HTML document with an image in it. I have an extension that detects <embed> tags in (plugin) documents and then does something special with it. And when I search for "image" in the Chrome Web Store, I see many results that should work with ImageDocuments.

If so, then no. The contract for when document_start scripts run is quite clear in this regard: <https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#run_at>  On the other hand, if the microtask runs quite soon (like, right after the document looks like <html><head></head><body></body></html>), then I think that breaking the contact is not going to be that bad for extension compatibility. ```     | **esprehn** | | I don't know how there would be a lot of DOM at the microtask if ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-09 01:11:16 UTC) [#8](#msg8) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` I don't know how there would be a lot of DOM at the microtask if we yield the parser, the only case is the image/plugin documents which sync build the DOM inside them.

Do you know whether the parser will yield soon enough?

This is needed because the observers expect the subject (RenderFrame) to be valid, so that e.g. RenderFrameObserver::render_frame() returns a valid pointer.

In general, we consider it an anti-pattern for observers to mutate the thing in a way that will break other observers =)  We've fixed some bugs in the past around things like the NTP synchronously navigating in WebFrameClient callbacks, causing the WebLocalFrame/RenderFrameImpl to be blown away before other observers run.  >  > >  > > I checked every file in extensions/renderer that includes render_frame_observer.h, and found a few occurrences: > > - extensions_render_frame_observer.h - safe (no untrusted calls) > > - extension_frame_helper.h - safe (no untrusted calls in observer notifications) > > - render_frame_observer_natives.cc - DidFailProvisionalLoad should be addressed (that is for another CL, because it is unrelated to this specific issue and I found another bug - crbug.com/585268). > > - script_injection_manager.cc - all fixed by this CL. > > - app_window_custom_bindings.cc - fixed by this CL. >  > You should land a WebScriptForbidenScope to anywhere you think is "safe" to prevent any future script from being added.

Because the scripts have to be injected before the rest of the document is parsed, there is no change from Blink's perspective.  The only benefit is that the RenderFrame observers are not invalidated while notifying the observers.  The downsides are: 1. If the parser is activated while the microtask queue is being drained, then the content script is NOT "immediately" injected (because nested microtasks are not possible). 2. Forcing a microtask checkpoint might have side effects. 3. Bookkeeping of injection state in the script injection manager is more complex.  Do you still want to go down the route of microtasks, or is the original method (patch set 4) okay? ```     | **esprehn** | | esprehn@chromium.org changed reviewers: + kouhei@chromium.org | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-10 01:08:57 UTC) [#14](#msg14) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` esprehn@chromium.org changed reviewers: + kouhei@chromium.org ```     | **esprehn** | | I have to think about this more, in the meantime you should get kouhei to ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-10 01:08:57 UTC) [#15](#msg15) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` I have to think about this more, in the meantime you should get kouhei to look at the parser changes. ```     | **kouhei (in TOK)** | | On 2016/02/10 01:08:57, esprehn wrote: > I have to think about this more, in the ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-10 01:21:19 UTC) [#16](#msg16) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/10 01:08:57, esprehn wrote: > I have to think about this more, in the meantime you should get kouhei to look > at the parser changes.

When the HTML document consists of text only, e.g. as in <iframe srcdoc="text"></iframe>, then we fall through to to "case InHeadMode" below, which calls m_tree.insertTextNode (<https://cs.chromium.org/HTMLConstructionSite%3A%3AinsertTextNode%20file%3Acpp>), which populates m_pendingText. The destructor of HTMLConstructionSite asserts whether m_pendingText is empty ([https://cs.chromium.org/HTMLConstructionSite%3A%3A~HTMLConstructionSite%20fil...](https://cs.chromium.org/HTMLConstructionSite%3A%3A~HTMLConstructionSite%20file%3Acpp)).

In general, observer APIs are not meant to change state RFH lifetime.

Explicitly doing it is a backwards step IMHO.  So you prefer something like this?  std::vector<base::Callback<void(RenderFrame)> > tasks; FOR_EACH_OBSERVER(RenderFrameObserver, observers_, DidCreateDocumentElement(&tasks));  if (!tasks.empty()) {   base::WeakPtr<RenderFrameImpl> self = weak_factory_.GetWeakPtr();   for (auto& task : tasks) {     task.Run(this);     if (!self.get())       return;   } } ```     | **nasko** | | On 2016/02/10 22:38:58, robwu wrote: > On 2016/02/10 22:25:20, nasko wrote: > > On 2016/02/10 ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-10 22:50:57 UTC) [#29](#msg29) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/10 22:38:58, robwu wrote: > On 2016/02/10 22:25:20, nasko wrote: > > On 2016/02/10 20:33:08, robwu wrote: > > > On 2016/02/10 19:53:46, yhirano wrote: > > > > I agree with <https://codereview.chromium.org/1642283002/#msg13> and > > > > <https://codereview.chromium.org/1642283002/#msg18>.

Why do we need tasks here? What I had in mind is something like this:  ... // existing observer loop can be before or after the following code ...  base::WeakPtr<RenderFrameImpl> self = weak_factory_.GetWeakPtr(); GetContentClient()->renderer()->CreatedDocument(frame_); if (!self.get())   return;  Then this CreateDocument API can be documented that it is allowed to delete the RenderFrame. In the chrome/ layer, it can be directed over to the extensions code, which will move whatever handling it has today from the observer method to this one.  The ContentRendererClient is an interface that is used to alter behavior already. It makes a lot more sense to go through it, even though at the end of the day the exact same code will execute as part of the extensions/ handling of the event. ```     | **esprehn** | | I'd prefer we didn't do that, I want this to be the only case we ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-10 23:06:11 UTC) [#30](#msg30) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` I'd prefer we didn't do that, I want this to be the only case we ever do run script.

I wasn't sure what part was concerning you when you said "I'd prefer we didn't do that".

I'm not opposed to it per se either, but I think it's cleaner if we handle the deletion-detection at the same layer that the deletion-triggering happens.  My reasoning is that passing a weakptr as an in-param fairly uncommon idiom outside of ctors and functions used as callbacks (where time might pass between the bind and the invocation). Uncommon idioms result in code that's harder to understand: in the case of the content client calls, when I first saw them, I wondered "Why would content need to pass a WeakPtr here? Is it possible the frame has already been deleted? If so why would content be reporting an event on the deleted frame?"  If RenderFrameHost had already exposed a public GetWeakPtr<> method I would have had no trouble with you using that. But it wasn't there already, and since there is a way to get the behavior you need without adding a method to RenderFrameHost, that's what I suggested. ```     | **robwu** | | rob@robwu.nl changed required reviewers: + kouhei@chromium.org, nick@chromium.org, rdevlin.cronin@chromium.org | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-12 19:51:42 UTC) [#41](#msg41) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` rob@robwu.nl changed required reviewers: + kouhei@chromium.org, nick@chromium.org, rdevlin.cronin@chromium.org ```     | **robwu** | | Devlin: Could you review extensions/? content/ has been approved, so I don't expect major changes ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-12 19:51:43 UTC) [#42](#msg42) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` Devlin: Could you review extensions/? content/ has been approved, so I don't expect major changes in extensions code.

If it comes to that, I'd rather we just expose a GetWeakPtr on RenderFrame (as devlin points out, it's a bit redundant to the routing pair lookup).

I tracked down all callees; besides extensions there is another part that could synchronously run scripts: MojoBindingsController::DidFinishDocumentLoad (from a cursory look, this seems like a safe & static script). Do you want ScriptForbiddenScope for document element insertion only, or for both notifications? Extension-specific callback names only make sense in the former case.

Consequently, extension code (content scripts, chrome.app.window.create) that run arbitrary code in the "document element created" and "document loaded" notifications may result in unexpected invalidation of memory, resulting in a UAF.  This patch fixes the bug by moving all code that runs untrusted code from observers to dedicated callbacks, which are only run at a safe point. All document parsers in Blink have been modified to make sure that they still work even when the document creation is interrupted by frame removal.  An extensive set of tests for all different kinds of documents, frame removal methods (e.g. synchronously / in mutation events / ...) and injection points (document start/end) have been added to avoid regressions.

Sorry, I started up writing this mail, but just fixing it for mojo bindings controller won't fix all the other instances where this sort of thing breaks. So I've been looking at other violations of this sort, why they need to inject script, and trying to write up something that covers why code does this today (usually it's because it wants to inject script or make something available 'as soon as possible') and try to explore better solutions for the future. ```     | **robwu** | | On 2016/02/19 23:02:47, esprehn wrote: > I'm loooking at the code for DidFinishDocumentLoad for workers, ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-19 23:32:52 UTC) [#64](#msg64) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/19 23:02:47, esprehn wrote: > I'm loooking at the code for DidFinishDocumentLoad for workers, it doesn't seem > to run any script sync, what fails here?  Thanks for the quick reply! I took another look, and it seems that you're probably right (I looked at the wrong overload).  I'll try to put a ScriptForbiddenScope around both notifications and cross my fingers. Do you insist on using an extension-specific notification name, or is a generic AfterDidFinishDocumentLoad also fine (with potential non-extension use cases in mind, e.g. MojoBindingsController)? ```     | **robwu** | | On 2016/02/19 23:06:33, dcheng wrote: > > dcheng: MojoBindingsController::DidFinishDocumentLoad may synchronously run a > callback ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-19 23:41:00 UTC) [#65](#msg65) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/19 23:06:33, dcheng wrote: > > dcheng: MojoBindingsController::DidFinishDocumentLoad may synchronously run a > callback that injects a script. > > - Is it important to run the callback synchronously (i.e. is it not possible > to use a PostTask)? > > - If yes, is the code safe for use with AllowUserAgentScript. > > I can also move MojoBindingsController::DidFinishDocumentLoad to the new > AfterDidFinishDocumentLoad (name is subject to change) notification, which > allows scripts to run, and also takes into account that scripts may invalidate > the frame. >  > Sorry, I started up writing this mail, but just fixing it for mojo bindings > controller won't fix all the other instances where this sort of thing breaks.

When I looked at all derived classes of RenderFrameObserver::DidFinishDocumentLoad, I didn't see any other non-extension use except for MojoBindingsController.

For DidFinishDocumentLoad(), I think that might be it, but we have similar problems in many other callbacks.

Could you take a look?  content/ and extensions/ were also changed, because I renamed AfterDidXX to RunScriptsAtDocumentStart/End (because the notification uses a completely different Blink notification, I didn't want to couple the naming with the existing notification, and I also wanted to emphasize that the callback is intended for logic that runs scripts).  I briefly made this bug public to run the try bots. Some bots are red, but that's because I marked the CL private again too soon. Then I made the CL public until the bot_update steps completed before making the bug private again. All remaining bots became green, which means that the latest change (introducing ScriptForbiddenScope) did not knowingly break any functionality (win_chromium_rel_ng and linux_chromium_rel_ng both cover extension tests and Blink, so that alone would be sufficient).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

A use-after-free was discovered when responding synchronously to

permission requests. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1578](/security/CVE-2016-1578))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2016-1646](/security/CVE-2016-1646))

A use-after-free was discovered in the navigation implementation in

Chromium in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1647](/security/CVE-2016-1647))

A buffer overflow was discovered in ANGLE. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2016-1649](/security/CVE-2016-1649))

An out-of-bounds write was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.

([CVE-2016-1653](/security/CVE-2016-1653))

An invalid read was discovered in the media subsystem in Chromium. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2016-1654](/security/CVE-2016-1654))

It was discovered that frame removal during callback execution could

trigger a use-after-free in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.

([CVE-2016-1655](/security/CVE-2016-1655))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1659](/security/CVE-2016-1659))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-3679](/security/CVE-2016-3679))
