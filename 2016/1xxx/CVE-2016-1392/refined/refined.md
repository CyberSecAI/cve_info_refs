Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1392

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is an open redirect in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The software fails to properly validate user-provided input, specifically URL parameters, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary malicious websites. This is a classic CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **User Redirection:** An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website, potentially for phishing attacks or malware distribution.
*   **Integrity Impact (Partial):** The CVSS vector indicates a partial Integrity impact (I:P), meaning the attacker can modify the user's intended destination.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Medium Complexity (AC:M):** The attack complexity is medium, suggesting that some skill or specific circumstances may be required for successful exploitation.
*   **No Authentication (Au:N):** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted URL to a user of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software.
*   No special privileges or access is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software versions 10.5 to 11.0.
*   There are no known workarounds available.
