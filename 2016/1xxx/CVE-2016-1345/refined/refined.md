Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the malicious file detection and blocking features of Cisco Firepower System Software. Specifically, the software fails to properly handle certain files, which allows them to bypass the malware detection mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation or processing of files leading to bypass of malware detection.
- Failure to enforce configured file action policies (Block Files, Block Malware, or Detect Files).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass malware detection mechanisms.
- Malicious files can be delivered to the system without being detected or blocked, potentially leading to compromise.
- This is a bypass vulnerability, allowing malicious files to pass through systems that should have blocked them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network attack, exploiting the vulnerability by sending specially crafted malicious files.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an affected Firepower system.
- No special access privileges on the target system are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability also affects the open-source Snort project if compiled with `--enable-file-inspect` flag.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products using Firepower System Software.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- A CVSS score of 5.0 (Base) / 4.1 (Temporal) is assigned.
- The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Check Point Security Team.
