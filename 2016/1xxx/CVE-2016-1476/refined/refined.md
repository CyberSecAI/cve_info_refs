Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the web application of Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series. It's a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored and executed within the application's context when other users access it. This is a CWE-79 vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a stored XSS attack. This could lead to:
    - Execution of malicious scripts within the context of the affected Cisco IP Phone web interface.
    - Potential for unauthorized actions, such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the web interface.
- The impact is limited to integrity, as the CVSS vector indicates no impact on confidentiality or availability (C:N/I:P/A:N).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network (AV:N).
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the web application (Au:S).
- **Low Complexity:** The attack has low complexity (AC:L), meaning it doesn't require specialized access conditions or circumstances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a valid user with the ability to log in to the web application of the Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series.
- The attacker needs to inject the malicious script via a user-supplied field in the web interface that is later displayed to other users.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series version 11.0.
- The advisory specifies that Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831, Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821, Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821-EX, and Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8825 are not affected.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has not yet confirmed any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The provided CVSS v2 score is Base 4.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N) and Temporal 3.8 (E:F/RL:U/RC:C).
