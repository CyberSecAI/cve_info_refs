```
1.  **Vulnerability:** CVE-2016-1867
2.  **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `jpc_pi_nextcprl()` function of the JasPer library. This function is used to parse JPEG 2000 image files.
3.  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Out-of-bounds read in `jpc_pi_nextcprl()`: The function attempts to access memory outside the bounds of allocated memory, leading to a crash.
4.  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service (DoS): A specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file can trigger the out-of-bounds read, causing the application using JasPer to crash.
5.  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Maliciously crafted JPEG 2000 image file: An attacker can create a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image that, when processed by an application using JasPer, will lead to the vulnerability.
6.  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to provide a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file to an application using the vulnerable JasPer library. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
        *   Tricking a user into opening a malicious image file.
        *   Uploading the image to a web application that processes it using JasPer.
        *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to provide the malicious file.
