For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the NTP suite:
On OSes (FreeBSD not affected) that allows packets claiming to be from
127.0.0.0/8 that arrive over physical network, if ntpd is configured to use
a reference clock, an attacker can inject packets over the network that look
like they are coming from that reference clock. [CVE-2016-1551, Reported by
Matt Street and others of Cisco ASIG]
If a system is set up to use a trustedkey, and if one is not using the
feature introduced in ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th field in the
ntp.keys file to specify which IPs can serve time, a malicious
authenticated peer -- i.e. one where the attacker knows the private
symmetric key -- can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in
order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock.
[CVE-2016-1549, Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG]
If ntpd was expressly configured to allow for remote configuration (this is
not common), a malicious user who knows the controlkey for ntpq or the
requestkey for ntpdc (if mode7 is expressly enabled) can create a session
with ntpd and if an existing association is unconfigured using the same IP
twice on the unconfig directive line, ntpd will abort. [CVE-2016-2516,
Reported by Yihan Lian of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360]
If ntpd was expressly configured to allow for remote configuration (this is
not common), a malicious user who knows the controlkey for ntpq or the
requestkey for ntpdc (if mode7 is expressly enabled) can create a session
with ntpd and then send a crafted packet to ntpd that will change the value
of the trustedkey, controlkey, or requestkey to a value that will prevent
any subsequent authentication with ntpd until ntpd is restarted.
[CVE-2016-2517, Reported by Yihan Lian of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360]
Using a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode > 7 causes
the MATCH\_ASSOC() lookup to make an out-of-bounds reference. [CVE-2016-2518,
Reported by Yihan Lian of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360]
ntpq and ntpdc can be used to store and retrieve information in ntpd. It is
possible to store a data value that is larger than the size of the buffer
that the ctl\_getitem() function of ntpd uses to report the return value.
If the length of the requested data value returned by ctl\_getitem() is too
large, the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the return
value from ctl\_getitem() was not directly checked to make sure it's not NULL,
but there are subsequent INSIST() checks that make sure the return value is
not NULL. There are no data values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would
exceed this buffer length. But if one has permission to store values and
one stores a value that is "too large", then ntpd will abort if an attempt
is made to read that oversized value. [CVE-2016-2519, Reported by
Yihan Lian of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360]
For ntp-4 versions up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p7, an off-path attacker
can cause a preemptable client association to be demobilized by sending a
crypto NAK packet to a victim client with a spoofed source address of an
existing associated peer. This is true even if authentication is enabled.
Furthermore, if the attacker keeps sending crypto NAK packets, for example
one every second, the victim never has a chance to reestablish the
association and synchronize time with that legitimate server. For ntp-4.2.8
up to ntp-4.2.8p6 there is less risk because more stringent checks are
performed on incoming packets, but there are still ways to exploit this
vulnerability in versions before ntp-4.2.8p7. [CVE-2016-1547, Reported by
Stephen Gray and Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG]
It is possible to change the time of an ntpd client or deny service to an
ntpd client by forcing it to change from basic client/server mode to
interleaved symmetric mode. An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate
ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the peer->dst timestamp
recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client will reject
all future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the victim
client to move time after the mode has been changed. ntpq gives no
indication that the mode has been switched. [CVE-2016-1548, Reported by
Miroslav Lichvar of RedHat and separately by Jonathan Gardner of
Cisco ASIG]
Packet authentication tests have been performed using memcmp() or possibly
bcmp(), and it is potentially possible for a local or perhaps LAN-based
attacker to send a packet with an authentication payload and indirectly
observe how much of the digest has matched. [CVE-2016-1550, Reported
independently by Loganaden Velvindron, and Matthew Van Gundy and
Stephen Gray of Cisco ASIG]
III. Impact
Malicious remote attackers may be able to break time synchornization,
or cause the ntpd(8) daemon to crash.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce risk associated with the attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:16/ntp.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:16/ntp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0132

## Network Time Protocol ntpd Reference Clock Impersonation Vulnerability

##### April 26, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-1551

### SUMMARY

ntpd relies on the underlying operating system to protect it from requests that impersonate reference clocks. Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the receive() function will match that reference clock’s peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer.

Any system that lacks the typical martian packet filtering [1] which would block these packets is in danger of having its time controlled by an attacker. The read\_network\_packet() function in ntp\_io.c addresses this issue for IPv6 with Bug 2672, because some OS’s were known to
not block spoofed ::1 addresses.

Some, if not all, reference clock drivers set their origin values to zero. It would be trivial to control time on a system with one of these drivers configured if these spoofed packets were not filtered.

ntpd should filter IPv4 packets with the address of 127.127.x.x for proactive protection for systems that fail to implement martian packet filtering.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian\_packet

### TESTED VERSIONS

NTP 4.2.8p3

NTPsec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92

### PRODUCT URLS

http://www.ntp.org/
https://www.ntpsec.org/

### CVSSv3 Score

CVSSv2: 2.6 - (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
CVSSv3: 3.7 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### MITIGATION (optional)

Modern Operating Systems already mitigate this vulnerability. For instances where the user can’t rely on their OS to filter martian packets, they could introduce additional filtering though a firewall.
