Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server administrator interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is included in the attacker's request, and the vulnerable application reflects this script back to the user in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of web pages
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens)
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
- This can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the WebEx Meetings Server administrative interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, meaning the attacker can be remote.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and tricks a user into clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated, remote attacker:** The attacker does not need any credentials and can launch the attack from anywhere on the network.
- Requires the ability to craft a malicious URL and social engineering to get a victim to visit that URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Meetings Server version 2.6.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)
- The CVSS base score is 4.3 and the temporal score is 3.4.
- There are no workarounds available. A software update is required to remediate the vulnerability.
-  Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
