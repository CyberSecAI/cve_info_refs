Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `AppleGraphicsControlClient::checkArguments` method within the `AppleMuxControl.kext` kernel extension.
- The code checks if a pointer is non-null, but proceeds to use it regardless of the check result, leading to a dereference if the pointer is null.
- A race condition can be exploited to cause this null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference.
- Race condition.
- Improper validation of a pointer before dereferencing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
- An attacker can gain control of the kernel and compromise the system.
- The exploit code maps the NULL page in userspace, and then the code makes a virtual call on a NULL object pointer leading to trivial kernel RIP control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation, through an application running on the system.
- By racing external methods calling `AppleGraphicsControlClient::checkArguments` with a thread calling `IOServiceClose`, a NULL pointer can be placed at the target location, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to run code on the targeted macOS system.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with IOKit services, specifically the "AppleMuxControl" service.
- The attacker must be able to map the null page in userspace.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on OS X 10.11.4 (15E65) MacBookPro 10,1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability and its exploitation.

The exploit code provided is designed to trigger the vulnerability:
1. It maps the NULL page as read/write.
2. It uses a thread to create a race condition.
3. The main thread calls `IOServiceClose()` after starting the thread, causing the pointer to be NULL at the time of dereference.

The Apple security advisory confirms that a null pointer dereference was fixed in the `AppleGraphicsControl` component.
