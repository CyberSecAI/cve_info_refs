A watch set on one of these properties can trigger code execution, which initializes the object with a destructor before the FileReference constructor sets the object data, leading to type confusion during garbage collection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by setting a watch on a property of a FileReference object and then instantiating it.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create and execute malicious ActionScript code within a context that uses FileReference, likely through a specially crafted SWF file. No specific information regarding position is given but network access would likely be required if the payload is hosted on a server."
