The provided content discusses a vulnerability in OpenCV related to heap corruption, which matches the description of CVE-2016-1517.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Heap corruption occurs in the feature extraction component of OpenCV's image processing library when freeing memory allocated for image processing. Specifically, the issue stems from an overflow in the matrix object, leading to illegal access to memory locations during deallocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Heap-based buffer overflow leading to memory corruption.
- Inadequate bounds checking during memory deallocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Remote code execution is possible through memory corruption.
- Denial of service via crashes when processing corrupted images.

**Attack vectors:**

- Processing a specially crafted image with OpenCV can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to be processed by the vulnerable OpenCV library.
- They do not need to be on the same system, a user could be tricked into processing a malicious image.
