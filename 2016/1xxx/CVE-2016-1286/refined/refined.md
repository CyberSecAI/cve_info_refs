Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1286:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an error within the BIND DNS server when parsing signature records associated with DNAME (Delegation Name) records. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when these signature records possess certain properties that trigger a flaw in the resolver.c or db.c components of BIND.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Improper parsing of signature records for DNAME records.
*   Assertion failure within resolver.c or db.c.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the named daemon (the BIND DNS server process) to crash due to an assertion failure. This results in a denial of service, making the DNS server unavailable to clients.
*   This can affect both recursive resolvers and authoritative-only servers.  Recursive resolvers are at higher risk but authoritative-only servers are vulnerable if the attacker can manipulate records requested by the authoritative server (e.g. slave servers performing SOA queries.)
*   The vulnerability can be exploited regardless of DNSSEC being enabled or disabled.
*   An attacker does not need a key or other authentication, but they do need to be within the address list specified in the "controls" statement if a control channel is open, otherwise localhost is the default address list if the rndc.key is present.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker sends a specially crafted DNS query designed to elicit a response that contains a malformed signature record for a DNAME record. This response triggers the vulnerability when parsed by the BIND server.
*   Attackers need to be able to make the target server request/receive the crafted DNS response (e.g., an attacker cannot directly target a non-recursive authoritative nameserver and send them the malformed data; the server has to have made the request itself.)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the target BIND server, or be able to cause a server to make a query which returns the malicious response.
*   Ability to craft a DNS response with a malformed signature record for a DNAME record.
*   For exploitation via the control channel, the attacker needs to send the malformed packets from a system specified in the "controls" configuration statement (or from localhost if the control channel uses the default address).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of BIND versions, including versions 9.0.0 through 9.10.3-P3.
*   Patches were made available by ISC and vendors like SUSE, Red Hat, and Debian to address this issue,
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 score of 7.8, with an attack vector of "Network", a low attack complexity, no authentication required and complete impact to availability.  CVSS v3 scores are as high as 8.6.
*   Disabling DNSSEC does not protect against this vulnerability.

This information provides a good understanding of CVE-2016-1286 and its potential impact. It should be used by security professionals to assess their environment and take appropriate mitigation steps.
