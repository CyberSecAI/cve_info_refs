Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the ImageConversion plugin of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC when handling TIFF images. Specifically, a crafted TIFF image with a specific TAGTYPE value can cause the application to read memory beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: The application attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
- Memory Corruption: This is a more general issue encompassing the out-of-bounds read which can corrupt data in memory

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the application's memory by reading beyond allocated buffer.
- Potential for further exploitation: The leaked information, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, could be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted TIFF image: The vulnerability is triggered by a specific structure within a TIFF image file.
- User interaction: The target must either open a malicious file or visit a malicious web page that contains the crafted TIFF image to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create or have access to a specially crafted TIFF image.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious TIFF image to the target and induce them to open it. This can be achieved through social engineering or by hosting a malicious webpage that displays the malicious image.
