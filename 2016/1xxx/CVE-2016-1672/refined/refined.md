Based on the provided documents, here is the information regarding CVE-2016-1672:

**Description:**
CVE-2016-1672 refers to a cross-origin bypass vulnerability in the extension bindings of Google Chrome before version 51.0.2704.63. The vulnerability lies within the `ModuleSystem::RequireForJsInner` function in `extensions/renderer/module_system.cc`. It mishandles properties, enabling remote attackers to perform bindings-interception attacks and bypass the Same Origin Policy.

**Affected Software:**
*   Google Chrome versions prior to 51.0.2704.63
*   Chromium-based browsers
*   openSUSE Leap 42.1
*   openSUSE 13.2
*   SUSE Package Hub for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary
*   Debian 8 (Jessie)
*   Gentoo

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of properties within the `ModuleSystem::RequireForJsInner` function in `extensions/renderer/module_system.cc`, allowing for bindings-interception attacks.

**Vulnerability:**
Cross-origin bypass in extension bindings.

**Attack Vector:**
Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious web content that, when processed by the affected browser, bypasses the Same Origin Policy.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to conduct bindings-interception attacks, which can lead to:

*   Bypassing the Same Origin Policy, thus gaining unauthorized access to resources from different origins.
*   Executing arbitrary code
*   Disclosing sensitive information
*   Causing Chromium to crash
*   Denial of Service

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to Google Chrome version 51.0.2704.63 or later. For other affected products, apply the relevant security updates provided by the respective vendors.
