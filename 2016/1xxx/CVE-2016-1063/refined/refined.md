The provided content relates to CVE-2016-1063.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption flaw in the handling of JPEG2000 images within Adobe Reader DC.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted JPEG2000 image embedded in a PDF can cause Adobe Reader DC to read memory past the end of an allocated object.
- Memory corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process, potentially taking control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack requires user interaction. A target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JPEG2000 image and embed it in a PDF file or a web page to lure a victim into opening it.
