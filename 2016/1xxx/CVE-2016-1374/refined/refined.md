Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1374

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the web framework of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Performance Manager. Specifically, there's a lack of proper input validation within the framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The web framework does not adequately sanitize or validate user-supplied input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands or code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. This could lead to:
    - **Complete Confidentiality Impact (C):** Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - **Complete Integrity Impact (I):** Modification or corruption of system data.
    - **Complete Availability Impact (A):** Denial of service or system shutdown.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Web Interface:**  The vulnerability is specifically related to the web framework, meaning the attack likely targets the web interface of the UCS Performance Manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials to access the web interface of the UCS Performance Manager. This means they are a 'Single' authenticated user according to the CVSS vector.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco UCS Performance Manager versions 2.0.0 and prior.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.1 and later.
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is:
    - Base Score: 9.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)
    - Temporal Score: 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C)
