    "description": "The WebContentsImpl::FocusLocationBarByDefault function in content/browser/web_contents/web_contents_impl.cc in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.75 mishandles focus for certain about:blank pages, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via a crafted URL.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `WebContentsImpl::FocusLocationBarByDefault` function within the Chromium browser. This function incorrectly handles focus for certain about:blank pages.",
      "weaknesses": [

      "attack_vectors": [
         "Crafted URL that causes a new window with an 'about:blank' page to open.",
         "Manipulation of navigation within the new window to load a malicious page while keeping the URL bar focused."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control the content of a webpage and initiate the opening of new browser windows. The attacker also needs to craft a specific URL to trigger the vulnerability."
