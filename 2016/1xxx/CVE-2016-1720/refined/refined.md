Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A memory corruption issue exists within the IOKit component of the operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Corruption: The primary weakness is a memory corruption vulnerability in the IOKit component.
- Use-After-Free (UAF): The Exploit-DB entry specifically mentions a use-after-free condition triggered by a race condition, which can lead to further memory corruption issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: A local user can execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. This means an attacker can potentially gain full control over the system.
- Denial of Service: As noted in the Exploit-DB entry, the vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service condition if exploited repeatedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system.
- Race Condition: The vulnerability can be exploited by triggering a race condition using multiple threads calling `IOServiceClose` concurrently.
- Specifically, the Exploit-DB entry uses `IntelAccelerator` as the vulnerable service but indicates that other IOKit services are vulnerable

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local User Access: The attacker must have some level of local user access to the target system.
- Ability to Execute Code: The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The fix involves improved memory handling within IOKit.
- The vulnerability affects various Apple products, including tvOS, watchOS, macOS, and iOS.
- The provided exploit code in the Exploit-DB entry demonstrates a proof-of-concept for triggering the use-after-free condition through concurrent calls to `IOServiceClose`.
