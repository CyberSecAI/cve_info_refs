## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

This is essentially a cherry-pick that was applied before plus the removal of a test that is now failing because it depends on more involved changes.

The SerializedScriptValue::transferArrayBuffers function in WebKit/Source/bindings/core/v8/SerializedScriptValue.cpp in the V8 bindings in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.94, mishandles certain array-buffer data structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[607652](https://crbug.com/607652)] CVE-2016-1666: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/50.0.2661.86..50.0.2661.94?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in [switching](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) release channels? Find out [how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).

## Details

An out of bounds write was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1660](/security/CVE-2016-1660))

It was discovered that Blink assumes that a frame which passes same-origin

checks is local in some cases. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-1661](/security/CVE-2016-1661))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1663](/security/CVE-2016-1663))

It was discovered that the JSGenericLowering class in V8 mishandles

comparison operators. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-1665](/security/CVE-2016-1665))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-1666](/security/CVE-2016-1666))

It was discovered that the TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded function in Blink

does not prevent script execution during node-adoption operations. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1667](/security/CVE-2016-1667))

It was discovered that the forEachForBinding in the V8 bindings in Blink

uses an improper creation context. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1668](/security/CVE-2016-1668))

A buffer overflow was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-1669](/security/CVE-2016-1669))

A race condition was discovered in ResourceDispatcherHostImpl in Chromium.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to make arbitrary HTTP

requests. ([CVE-2016-1670](/security/CVE-2016-1670))
