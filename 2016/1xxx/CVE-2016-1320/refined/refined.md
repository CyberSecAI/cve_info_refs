Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1320

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of quotes within the `show tech` command of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning CLI. The application executes `/bin/tar` and `/bin/rm` via a `system()` call, and the parsing of extra quotes allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system due to insufficient input validation in the CLI's `show tech` command. Specifically, the command injection is enabled by improper parsing of quotes when writing diagnostic information to disk.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability allows a local, authenticated user with `admin` privileges to execute commands as `root` on the underlying Linux operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute any command on the system, including downloading additional software (e.g., using `wget`), modifying system configurations, or exfiltrating data.
- **Data Breach/Integrity Loss:** A compromised system can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and overall loss of system integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **CLI:** The attack vector is through the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco Prime Collaboration server.
- **`show tech` command:**  The specific command abused is `show tech` within the "walled" CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials for the Cisco Prime Collaboration server, specifically, an account with `admin` privileges.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system via terminal or SSH to access the CLI.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the `show tech` command and how to inject commands through the improperly handled quotes.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Prime Collaboration versions 9.0 and 11.0.

**Additional Information:**
- The Tenable advisory notes that version 11.0.0.815 allows a `root` user to access a full bash terminal, while version 9.0.0.23593 does not. This implies the attack surface may be different in these versions, although both are vulnerable.
- Cisco has released Prime Collaboration Provisioning 11.1 which addresses this issue.
- The vulnerability is also tracked as Cisco Bug ID CSCux69286 and PSIRT-1265647782
- The provided CVSS v2 score is 4.3 (base) and 3.6 (temporal). The CVSS v3 score is 6.7.
