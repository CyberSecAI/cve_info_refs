Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-1570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing sanity checks within the PV superpage functionality of the Xen hypervisor. Specifically, the hypervisor fails to validate the page identifier (MFN) passed by guest VMs during MMUEXT_MARK_SUPER and MMUEXT_UNMARK_SUPER operations, and also during various page table update operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation for the MFN (Machine Frame Number) provided by guest VMs when marking or unmarking superpages.
- Insufficient checks during page table updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a range of negative impacts:
- Information leaks
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Privilege escalation. The advisory mentions "unknown effects" but implies escalation is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable by PV (Paravirtualized) guest VMs.
- Attackers need to have the ability to manipulate hypercalls to perform MMUEXT_MARK_SUPER and MMUEXT_UNMARK_SUPER operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to be a malicious or compromised PV guest VM.
- The attacker must be able to execute hypercalls and manipulate memory mappings, requiring guest-level privileges in their VM.
- The PV superpage feature must be enabled on the Xen hypervisor. This is controlled by the `allowsuperpage` (or `allowhugepage` in older Xen versions) command line option.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability affects Xen versions 3.4.0, 3.4.1, and from 4.1 onwards.
- Only x86 systems are vulnerable.
- The issue can be avoided by disabling the PV superpage feature.
- Patches were released to resolve the issue.
