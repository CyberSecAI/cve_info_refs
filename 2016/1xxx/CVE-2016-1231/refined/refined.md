Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a path traversal flaw within the `mod_http_files` module of the Prosody XMPP server. This module, designed to serve static files over HTTP, incorrectly handles file paths. It appends the requested path to the configured public root directory without proper sanitization or normalization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper path sanitization, specifically not handling ".." sequences in the request path. This allows an attacker to construct a request that navigates outside of the intended file serving directory.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The module fails to validate or normalize the requested path, allowing it to access files outside the designated public root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:**  Attackers can potentially gain access to any file on the server that the Prosody process has access to, including sensitive data such as configuration files, user data, or other private information.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The exposure of private files can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, potentially including secrets, credentials, or personal data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests to the server using the `mod_http_files` module. The malicious path is embedded within the URL. For example, `/files/../../sensitive/file.txt` would attempt to access a file outside the defined `http_files_dir`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Prosody server on the port where the HTTP service is running.
*   **Knowledge of the module:** The attacker needs to know that the module `mod_http_files` is enabled (if it is not default), and its basic mechanism of serving files to construct the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The default configuration of Prosody has the `mod_http_files` disabled, thus making it not vulnerable in its default configuration.
*   Configurations where `mod_http_files` is serving files at the root URL (e.g., not /files/ prefix, using http_paths) are also not vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Prosody version 0.9.9 and later, as well as in nightly builds.
*   The issue was reported and fixed by Kim Alvefur from the Prosody team
