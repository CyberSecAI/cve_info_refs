## CVE-2016-1684

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Description:**

CVE-2016-1684 is an integer overflow vulnerability found in `numbers.c` in libxslt before 1.1.29. It affects Google Chrome (versions before 51.0.2704.63) and other software that uses the vulnerable libxslt library.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `i` format token for `xsl:number` data is handled. The code mishandles this token, leading to an integer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Document:** The primary attack vector involves a remote attacker enticing a user to open a specially crafted document (e.g., a PDF or XML/XSLT file).
*   **Website:** A user may be tricked into visiting a website that triggers the vulnerability.

**Impact:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The integer overflow can lead to resource consumption, causing the application (e.g., Chrome, or any application using libxslt) to crash.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** There's a possibility of other unspecified impacts, which could include arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Software (based on the provided documents):**

*   Google Chrome (versions before 51.0.2704.63)
*   libxslt (versions before 1.1.29)
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary (chromium-browser)
*   Fedora (mingw-libxslt)
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise (Chromium)
*   Apple's iCloud for Windows, iTunes for Windows, tvOS, and iOS and macOS (due to the included libxslt)

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading:

*   Chrome to version 51.0.2704.63 or later.
*   libxslt to version 1.1.29 or later.
*   Applying the relevant security updates for Red Hat, Fedora, SUSE, Debian and Apple products.
