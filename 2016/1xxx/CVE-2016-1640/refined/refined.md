CVE-2016-1640
```
The provided documents describe multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Google Chrome before version 49.0.2623.75, with a specific focus on CVE-2016-1640.

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the Web Store inline-installer implementation within the Extensions UI of Google Chrome.
*   The system does not properly handle the deletion of an installation frame during an inline installation, leading to a potential origin confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Origin Confusion:** The core issue is that when a frame that initiates an inline installation is deleted before user confirmation, the installation process does not stop. This could lead to the user believing that the install request originated from the new page they are navigating to, rather than the malicious previous page. This is due to the installation dialog remaining active and potentially being associated with the new context.
*   **Lack of proper frame context management:**  The system fails to cancel or block the installation when the originating frame is removed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can use this flaw to trick users into installing malicious extensions. This is because the prompt appears to be associated with a trusted site (the one the user has navigated to) when it originated from another, malicious site.
*   **Integrity Violation:** By misleading users into installing unwanted or malicious extensions, attackers can compromise the integrity of the user's browsing environment and potentially gain access to sensitive data and functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:**  The attack is delivered over the network by a malicious website.
*   **User Interaction:** A user must visit a specially crafted malicious website.
*   **Navigation:** The vulnerability involves the user navigating away from the malicious site, which does not stop the ongoing installation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website that attempts an inline installation.
*   **Timing:** The attacker must time the deletion of the installation frame with the user's navigation action. The malicious site initiates an inline install, and then, before the user accepts the install, the site navigates the user to a different URL. The installation dialog remains active, and if the user accepts, the extension is installed, making it seem the new site requested it.
*   **No User Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require user credentials or other authentication to execute this vulnerability.
