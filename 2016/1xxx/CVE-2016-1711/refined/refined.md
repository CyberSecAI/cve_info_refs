Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1711:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `FrameLoader.cpp` of the Blink rendering engine. Specifically, the code fails to disable frame navigation during a detach operation on a `DocumentLoader` object.

**Weakness:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper control over frame navigation during the detach process of a `DocumentLoader`. This allows for unintended access and manipulation of the frame's state.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By exploiting this flaw, a remote attacker could bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP). This could lead to:
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive data from different origins
  -  Cross-site scripting attacks by manipulating other frames.
  - Potential arbitrary code execution due to exploitation of memory errors during frame detach process.

**Attack vector:**
The attack vector is through a crafted web site. A user visiting such a website could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host and deliver a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerability in the Blink rendering engine. The attacker does not need to have prior authentication or privileges. However, user interaction (visiting the malicious website) is required.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-1711 is a Same Origin Policy bypass vulnerability caused by improper handling of frame navigation during a detach operation in Blink. This could potentially lead to disclosure of sensitive information, cross-site scripting, or arbitrary code execution by an attacker convincing a user to visit a specially crafted website.
