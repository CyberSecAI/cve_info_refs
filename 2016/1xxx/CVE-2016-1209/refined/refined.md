Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a combination of factors: the inclusion of a preview of the 3.0 codebase within versions 2.9.36 to 2.9.42 of the Ninja Forms plugin, which contained several vulnerabilities, and the ability for an attacker to bypass the check intended to prevent the execution of this code.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the fact that untrusted POST data is unserialized, leading to PHP object injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The `upload()` function within the 3.0 codebase was accessible without proper authentication and was only protected by a nonce that was leaked on every form, allowing arbitrary file uploads.
2.  **Incomplete File Validation:** The `validate()` function did not properly validate uploaded files, accepting any file type and allowing placement anywhere the PHP process had write permissions (through directory traversal).
3.  **Unauthenticated Settings Update:** Unauthenticated users could update any Ninja Forms settings by sending an HTTP POST request to `update_nina_forms_settings`.
4.  **Unauthenticated Import/Export:** The import and export functions for forms and fields could be called by unauthenticated users, enabling malicious modifications and also allowing PHP object injection due to the usage of `unserialize()`.
5.  **Nonce Leak:** The `ninja_forms_ajax_nonce` was leaked on every form, whether a user was logged in or not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The arbitrary file upload vulnerability, combined with the lack of validation, could enable an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Settings Tampering:** Attackers could change any settings of the Ninja Forms plugin, potentially disrupting functionality or gaining further access.
*   **Form Hijacking:** Exported forms could be modified to include malicious code (XSS), and then re-imported to hijack forms, potentially redirecting submissions, collecting sensitive data, or performing other malicious actions on site visitors.
*   **PHP Object Injection:** Through import functionality, malicious serialized objects could be injected leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerabilities were exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to vulnerable endpoints within the plugin.
*   **Bypassing 3.0 Code Check:** Attackers could bypass the check that was intended to only allow administrators to use the 3.0 code.
*   **Nonce Reuse:** The leaked nonce allowed attackers to perform actions that normally require authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker requires remote network access to the target server running a vulnerable version of the plugin.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Most of the vulnerabilities did not require any authentication, making it easier for attackers to exploit the weaknesses. A basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to craft them would be required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were present in versions 2.9.36 to 2.9.42 of the Ninja Forms WordPress plugin.
*   The vulnerability was patched in versions 2.9.43 and .1 releases of 2.9.36 through 2.9.42 (e.g., 2.9.36.1, 2.9.37.1, etc.) and also 2.9.45 which contained fixes for other vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were present in a preview of the 3.0 codebase that was included within the mentioned versions.
*   The developers of the plugin were contacted, and they released a patch. The WordPress.org plugin security team also assisted in pushing an automatic update to affected sites.
