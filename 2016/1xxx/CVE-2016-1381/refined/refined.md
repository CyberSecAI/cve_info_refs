Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the cached file-range request functionality of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is a flaw in how the WSA handles cached file-range requests. This allows an attacker to send specially crafted requests that consume excessive system memory, leading to resource exhaustion. The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper resource management during the processing of these requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected Cisco WSA device. The appliance will run out of system memory, causing it to become unresponsive and disrupting its ability to perform its intended security functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical or local access to the device. They can send the malicious requests over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Cisco WSA. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, which makes it easily exploitable from the network.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The advisory provides specific CLI commands to check for a compromise: `version` to check the AsyncOS version and `status detail` to check for an accumulation of TCP connections.
- A temporary workaround is provided that involves restarting the proxy process (`diagnostic -> PROXY -> KICK`) to reclaim memory.
- The advisory lists the affected software versions and the fixed releases.
- Snort rule 36649 is provided to detect exploitation attempts.
- The provided CVSS vector is `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C` with a Base Score of 7.8 and Temporal Score of 6.8.
