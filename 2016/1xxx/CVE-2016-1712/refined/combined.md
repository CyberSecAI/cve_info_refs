### Description

Palo Alto Networks firewalls do not properly sanitize the root\_reboot local invocation which can potentially allow executing code with higher privileges (Ref. 92293) (CVE-2016-1712).

Exploitation of this privilege escalation is restricted to local users. Potential attackers would have to first obtain a shell on the device before they could attempt to escalate privileges through this vulnerability.

This issue affects PAN-OS 5.0.18 and earlier; PAN-OS 5.1.11 and earlier; PAN-OS 6.0.13 and earlier; PAN-OS 6.1.11 and earlier; PAN-OS 7.0.7 and earlier

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 7.0 | <= 7.0.7 | >= 7.0.8 |
| PAN-OS 6.1 | <= 6.1.11 | >= 6.1.12 |
| PAN-OS 6.0 | <= 6.0.13 | >= 6.0.14 |
| PAN-OS 5.1 | <= 5.1.11 | >= 5.1.12 |
| PAN-OS 5.0 | <= 5.0.18 | >= 5.0.19 |
