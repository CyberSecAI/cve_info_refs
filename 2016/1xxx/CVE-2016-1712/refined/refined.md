Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `root_reboot` local invocation within Palo Alto Networks firewalls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The firewall software fails to properly validate or sanitize input provided to the `root_reboot` function, allowing for potential injection of malicious code or commands.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** This flaw allows a local user to execute code with elevated (higher) privileges than they should normally have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact (High):** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored or processed by the firewall.
*   **Integrity Impact (High):** An attacker can potentially modify or tamper with system settings and configurations on the firewall, or even the data being processed.
*   **Availability Impact (High):** An attacker could potentially cause denial of service or otherwise interrupt normal operations of the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have a shell or some form of access to the device itself.
*   **`root_reboot` invocation:** The vulnerability is triggered by invoking the local `root_reboot` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** An attacker must first obtain a shell or some form of local access to the Palo Alto Networks firewall device.
*   **Ability to invoke `root_reboot`:** The attacker needs to be able to invoke the vulnerable `root_reboot` function, possibly by exploiting the input validation flaw.

**Affected Versions:**

*   PAN-OS 5.0.18 and earlier
*   PAN-OS 5.1.11 and earlier
*   PAN-OS 6.0.13 and earlier
