**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS issue. This means that the malicious script is embedded in a crafted URL and is reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct a reflected XSS attack against a user of the web interface of the affected Cisco Prime Service Catalog system.

    * Session hijacking
    * Defacement of the web page
    * Redirecting the user to a malicious site
    * Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely over the network.
* **HTTP Request:** A malicious crafted HTTP request is sent to the vulnerable web interface of the Cisco Prime Service Catalog. The request contains malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system.
* **Remote:** The attacker can initiate the attack remotely over the network.
* **Craft HTTP request:** The attacker has to craft a specific URL that includes the malicious script that will be reflected back to the user's browser when they click the URL
