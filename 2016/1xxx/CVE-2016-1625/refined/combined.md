The owners of this code appear to be inactive in Chromium, but I've CCed them as well.  Note that I would have preferred to implement this check in SearchIPCRouter::OnSearchBoxNavigate, but there's a lot of delegate and policy interfaces. So unfortunately, implementing the check in the concrete implementation of SearchIPCRouter::Delegate used by the real browser is the easiest way.  I'm thinking about ways to add a unit test, but it's a bit tricky given how this is currently written. I'm guessing I'll end up friending a lot of random things. ```     | **dcheng** | | The CQ bit was checked by dcheng@chromium.org to run a CQ dry run | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-04 04:35:38 UTC) [#3](#msg3) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` The CQ bit was checked by dcheng@chromium.org to run a CQ dry run ```     | **commit-bot: I haz the power** | | Dry run: CQ is trying da patch.

ChildProcessSecurityPolicy::IsWebSafeScheme might be a good candidate.  On the other hand, what restrictions do we have on the most visited and suggestion URLs?  Can chrome-extension:// URLs show up there (e.g., if they're web accessible)?  Can chrome:// URLs?  (Hopefully not.)

TopSites gets its data from the HistoryService, and so I'm not sure at what layer a scheme filter would be applied at. I agree that whatever whitelist we come up with should apply to both the frontend and backend. ```     | **Charlie Reis** | | On 2016/02/04 17:13:32, Charlie Reis wrote: > On 2016/02/04 16:35:15, Robert Sesek wrote: > > ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-04 17:18:15 UTC) [#26](#msg26) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/04 17:13:32, Charlie Reis wrote: > On 2016/02/04 16:35:15, Robert Sesek wrote: > > On 2016/02/04 16:21:01, dcheng wrote: > > > I was looking at the scheme blacklist, and I'm wondering if there's a better > > > way: there are other 'weird' schemes that I wouldn't expect to be valid > > > navigation targets for 1993 (such as chrome-devtools://).

For example, see this comment in search_ipc_router.h:      // Called when the page wants to navigate to |url|.

We definitely want to enforce this in the browser process, though I'm not opposed to also having a check in the renderer process.  Samarth, it looks like you added the comment about using this API for privileged URLs in <https://codereview.chromium.org/11824050> (in instant_page.h at the time).

Can you let us know why that was needed and what will break if we > prevent it now?  There's a long history behind NavigateContentWindow.  In the beginning, this API was meant to be used both for most visited items as well as for suggestions in the HTML-based omnibox popup.  The latter never launched.  In the suggest case, you could definitely end up with chrome:// URLs in the suggestions and this API provided a way for the HTML omnibox popup to navigate to those URLs when the user selected those suggestions.  The comment here probably dates to that use case.  At this point, we only need NCW for most visited/most likely so it can much more limited.  Even better, each most visited item is rendered as regular links inside chrome-search:// iframes, so you might wonder why we need this API at all.  I think there are three issues: 1) For a11y, we need to support keyboard navigation.  That logic is still in the JS in the NTP so it needs a way to trigger navigations. 2) You can't arbitrarily link to privileged URLs like chrome://.  Though, it might be better to allow chrome-search:// to link to these URLs rather than make NCW to support it. 3) With MostLikely, the browser didn't actually have knowledge of what the URLs were so you couldn't just have a RID-based NCW.  Sounds like this is changing from Mathieu's reply earlier.  So the summary of all of this I think is that if change that Mathieu alluded to earlier is done, we should at least get rid of the URL-based NCW and only have a RID version.  It's also potentially feasible to kill this altogether and just have them be regular links but that will require more changes to make sure we don't break a11y.  In the short term, unfortunately, I don't know what URLs can and can not enter Most Visited/Likely.  But I'm pretty sure that comment was not added to specifically deal with that case.  Thanks, Samarth ```     | **dcheng** | | On 2016/02/04 at 17:11:26, mathp wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:05:55, Jered wrote: > > +mathp ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-04 17:48:58 UTC) [#31](#msg31) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/04 at 17:11:26, mathp wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:05:55, Jered wrote: > > +mathp will this break most likely? > >  > > Given the immediate concerns this lgtm. >  > Depends if the SuggestionsService is used.

The current check uses both |most_visited_items_| and |suggestions_items_| (which is actually a lot less strict than I'd prefer).

There have been exploits in the past that sent IPCs directly, which would bypass this check completely (I know that we now verify that the IPC is from an instant process, but it is still better to verify browser side).

Breaking Chrome in a security merge is definitely something that was worrying me.  One "easy" fix is to filter dangerous URLs from |most_visited_items_| and |suggestions_items_| when they're set. On the other hand, this starts getting into "uncomfortably exciting to merge into stable branch" territory. Maybe we can limit the scheme filter to just chrome:// URLs for now? I'd hate to check this in without it being that effective because there's actually some way of chrome:// URLs getting into most visited sites pretty easily... ```     | **Charlie Reis** | | On 2016/02/04 17:43:46, samarth wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:26:25, Charlie Reis wrote: > > On ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-04 17:51:07 UTC) [#32](#msg32) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/04 17:43:46, samarth wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:26:25, Charlie Reis wrote: > > On 2016/02/04 17:20:44, samarth wrote: > > > We could also make this check in the renderer process in  > searchbox_extension > > > here: > > > > > > [https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/se...](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/searchbox/searchbox_extension.cc&q=searchbox_exte&sq=package:chromium&l=1138) > > >  > > > Note that it has access to the most visited items: > > > > > > [https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/se...](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/searchbox/searchbox.cc&sq=package:chromium&l=308&rcl=1454589471) > > >  > > > On one hand, that's where the check for javascript: scheme resides and it'd > be > > > better for these checks to be centralized.

That makes me happier with the approach taken here, though there's still some risk of regression since we don't know which chrome:// or chrome-extension:// URLs can show up in the tiles.  I'll copy your comment over to the bug and we can discuss followup CLs from there.  For now, I think the decision to make is whether to limit the URL-based API to a whitelist (like IsWebSafeScheme) or just trust what's in the Most Visited and Suggestions lists.  I want to land something that's unlikely to get reverted and is easy to merge. ```     | **Jered** | | On 2016/02/04 17:43:46, samarth wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:26:25, Charlie Reis wrote: > > On ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-04 17:51:21 UTC) [#33](#msg33) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/04 17:43:46, samarth wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:26:25, Charlie Reis wrote: > > On 2016/02/04 17:20:44, samarth wrote: > > > We could also make this check in the renderer process in  > searchbox_extension > > > here: > > > > > > [https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/se...](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/searchbox/searchbox_extension.cc&q=searchbox_exte&sq=package:chromium&l=1138) > > >  > > > Note that it has access to the most visited items: > > > > > > [https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/se...](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/searchbox/searchbox.cc&sq=package:chromium&l=308&rcl=1454589471) > > >  > > > On one hand, that's where the check for javascript: scheme resides and it'd > be > > > better for these checks to be centralized.

Do you know of a way for an attacker to get chrome:// URLs into Most Visited, or are you just worried that it might be possible?  I would hope that would be just as difficult as navigating to a chrome:// URL in the first place, which is what the attack was using this API for.  I could be ok with limiting the check to chrome:// URLs for now.  That might be a good balance between security and avoiding possible regressions. ```     | **dcheng** | | On 2016/02/04 at 17:53:40, creis wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:48:58, dcheng wrote: > > Breaking ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-04 17:56:44 UTC) [#36](#msg36) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/04 at 17:53:40, creis wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:48:58, dcheng wrote: > > Breaking Chrome in a security merge is definitely something that was worrying > > me. > >  > > One "easy" fix is to filter dangerous URLs from |most_visited_items_| and > > |suggestions_items_| when they're set.

That might be a good balance between security and avoiding possible regressions.  I don't but I'm not familiar with the code. I'll update the CL to just filter on chrome://.  Re: IsWebSafeScheme: that's definitely a much more aggressive and restrictive change, so I think that should be done in followups by whoever owns the code now. ```     | **Charlie Reis** | | On 2016/02/04 17:53:20, Jered wrote: > > Fantastic.

As Daniel mentions, IsWebSafeScheme seems like the least safe merge, at least from a regression perspective.  It will almost certainly break attempts to visit chrome-extension:// URLs that are in Most Visited, assuming that's possible. ```     | **finkm** | | On 2016/02/04 17:11:26, Mathieu Perreault wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:05:55, Jered wrote: > > +mathp ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-04 18:12:25 UTC) [#38](#msg38) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/04 17:11:26, Mathieu Perreault wrote: > On 2016/02/04 17:05:55, Jered wrote: > > +mathp will this break most likely? > >  > > Given the immediate concerns this lgtm. >  > Depends if the SuggestionsService is used.

# Chromium: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the Chromium web
browser, the worst of which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **49.0.2623.87** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **49.0.2623.87** |

### Background

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer,
faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Chromium web
browser. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, obtain
sensitive information, or bypass security restrictions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=www-client/chromium-49.0.2623.87"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c0)  Deleted Name   2016-02-08 08:45:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 664705](attachment.cgi?id=664705 "Google Chrome and Chromium outputs of chrome://gpu") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=664705&action=edit "Google Chrome and Chromium outputs of chrome://gpu") Google Chrome and Chromium outputs of chrome://gpu  UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.82 Safari/537.36  Example URL:  Steps to reproduce the problem: 1. Open any page with WebGL content or test with:  <http://get.webgl.org/> <http://webglreport.com/>  2. Check chrome://flags - yes, Override software rendering list is Enabled but that doesn't help  3. Check the same thing in Google Chrome and Firefox  4. Compare chrome://gpu in Google Chrome and Chromium (screenshots attached)  WebGL doesn't work in Chromium but works in Google Chrome (and Firefox). Also hardware acceleration is unavailable in Chromium for some reason although both Chromium and Google Chrome use identical settings.  I am attaching screenshots of chrome://gpu output from both Google Chrome and Chromium for comparison. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c1)  Deleted Name   2016-02-09 10:03:56 UTC  ``` Just tested with Chromium version 48.0.2564.103 from  [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/chromium/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network%3A/chromium/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/)  The issue remains. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c2)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 09:32:22 UTC  ``` It seems I am again being sent back from code.google.com to here:  <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=585046#c6>  They say "We don't provide support for those - please file a bug with your distribution, or reproduce the issue with your own build." ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c3)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 10:34:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Name Deleted from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c2)) > It seems I am again being sent back from code.google.com to here: >  > <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=585046#c6> >  > They say "We don't provide support for those - please file a bug with your > distribution, or reproduce the issue with your own build."  Looks like the same issue as in [Bug#966082](show_bug.cgi?id=966082 "RESOLVED FIXED - chromium: sandbox related stacktrace printed").  Btw, do you have vdpau-video installed? Try to remove that as a test.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 966082](show_bug.cgi?id=966082 "RESOLVED FIXED - chromium: sandbox related stacktrace printed") *** ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c4)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 10:40:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Bauer from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c3)) > Looks like the same issue as in [Bug#966082](show_bug.cgi?id=966082 "RESOLVED FIXED - chromium: sandbox related stacktrace printed").

That bug is marked as fixed but it seems it is not.  That bug has only been fixed for 13.2 by not patching chromium to use libva any more on 13.2. But you are using Leap 42.1, no?  The stacktrace is exactly the same... I suppose it happens because libva fails to open the driver: libva info: VA-API version 0.38.0 libva info: va_getDriverName() returns 0 libva info: Trying to open /usr/lib64/dri/nvidia_drv_video.so libva info: va_openDriver() returns -1 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c6)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 11:22:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Bauer from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c5)) > That bug has only been fixed for 13.2 by not patching chromium to use libva > any more on 13.2. > But you are using Leap 42.1, no?  Thanks for explaining.  Yes, I am using Leap 42.1. I hope you can fix this :) ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c7)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 11:28:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Name Deleted from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c6)) > Yes, I am using Leap 42.1. I hope you can fix this :)  I'm not a chromium maintainer.  But it seems like it would be a good idea to remove libva support completely again. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c8)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 11:32:05 UTC  ``` I hope someone else can do it then. Thanks. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c9)  Forgotten User sM9JzehKpy   2016-02-13 11:48:06 UTC  ``` Ok. I removed the libva patch completely. I wasn't really happy with this patch in the first place, but the submitter indicated that it wouldn't do any harm and that he tested, etc.   Unfortunately it seems that this might be true on Tumbleweed, but for the older builds this is definitely not the case. Also I know already that future chromium builds will no longer build with this patch, so it was just a matter of time before it got disabled.   As soon as the build in network:chromium is finished, I will push it out as a maintenance update. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c10)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 11:50:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Raymond Wooninck from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c9)) > As soon as the build in network:chromium is finished, I will push it out as > a maintenance update.  Sounds great Raymond! Thanks a lot. Looking forward to it. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c11)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 11:59:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Raymond Wooninck from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c9)) > Unfortunately it seems that this might be true on Tumbleweed, but for the > older builds this is definitely not the case.  Well, it might also depend on the actual graphics card/driver that's being used, I suppose... ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c12)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 12:04:11 UTC  ``` In my particular case it is GTX680 with latest drivers from nVidia. But I suppose this is visible on the screenshots. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c13)  Deleted Name   2016-02-15 14:12:45 UTC  ``` I have just upgraded to chromium-48.0.2564.103-830.2.x86_64  Visiting chrome://gpu now shows that hardware acceleration is working. Thanks!  In section "Problem Detected" there are these:  Problems Detected Always call glUseProgram after a successful link to avoid a driver bug: 349137 Applied Workarounds: use_current_program_after_successful_link Program link fails in NVIDIA Linux if gl_Position is not set: 286468 Applied Workarounds: init_gl_position_in_vertex_shader Clear uniforms before first program use on all platforms: 124764, 349137 Applied Workarounds: clear_uniforms_before_first_program_use Linux NVIDIA drivers don't have the correct defaults for vertex attributes: 351528 Applied Workarounds: init_vertex_attributes Always rewrite vec/mat constructors to be consistent: 398694 Applied Workarounds: scalarize_vec_and_mat_constructor_args MakeCurrent is slow on Linux with NVIDIA drivers Applied Workarounds: use_virtualized_gl_contexts NVIDIA fails glReadPixels from incomplete cube map texture: 518889 Applied Workarounds: force_cube_complete  Is that normal?
