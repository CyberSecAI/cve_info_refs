{
  "CVE-2016-1560": {
    "Description": "ExaGrid ships a public/private key pair on their backup appliances to allow passwordless authentication to other ExaGrid appliances. Since the private key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote access as root. Additionally, this module will attempt to use the default password for root, 'inflection'.",
    "Root cause": "ExaGrid appliances ship with a publicly known private SSH key and a default root password.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of hardcoded/easily retrievable private SSH key.",
      "Use of a default root password."
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthorized remote access as root.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation via SSH using the known private key.",
      "Exploitation via SSH using the default password."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ExaGrid appliance."
  }
}
