Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-1839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability lies in the `xmlDictAddString` function within the libxml2 library. This function is responsible for adding strings to a dictionary used by the XML parser. A heap-based buffer over-read can occur if the function improperly handles the input string size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Heap-Based Buffer Over-Read:** The `xmlDictAddString` function attempts to read beyond the boundaries of allocated heap memory. This is an out-of-bounds read.
-   **Improper Input Handling**: The core issue seems to be related to how the function handles the size of strings it receives as input when adding to a dictionary. The vulnerability occurs when the function tries to read more memory than what's available.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. When a specially crafted XML document triggers the buffer over-read, the application using libxml2 crashes. This may happen on the server processing the XML document or the client displaying the content.
-  **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution** Some content mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution in addition to DoS, this is less likely, but remains a possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote Attackers:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
-   **Crafted XML Document:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted XML document. The content and structure of the document must be designed to trigger the vulnerability within `xmlDictAddString`.
-   **Application using libxml2**: The attack targets applications that utilize the vulnerable versions of `libxml2` to process XML documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted XML document to a system that processes it using a vulnerable libxml2 version.
-   No authentication or special privileges are needed, as the vulnerability is triggered by processing the crafted XML document.
-   The attacker position can be a remote one.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided content indicates that several products and distributions were affected by this vulnerability (Apple iOS, OS X, tvOS, watchOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Gentoo).
-   The fix involves updating the libxml2 library to a version where this vulnerability is patched, thus preventing the buffer over-read from happening. The specific commits to fix the issue are also mentioned.
-   Some content also mentions similar issues to CVE-2016-1839 and other related CVEs, indicating there were many vulnerabilities within the same timeframe that affected `libxml2`.
