Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco WSA, both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments on the ESA or services scanning content of web access on the WSA. The following is an example of a configured ESA message filter to scan files with .zip or.exe attachments:      *Test\_Attachment\_Rules:   if attachment-filename == "(?i)\\.zip$" { log-entry("Rule attachment-filename found a .zip file"); }   if attachment-filename == "(?i)\\.exe$" { log-entry("Rule attachment-filename found a .exe file"); }   if attachment-filetype == "Compressed" { log-entry("Rule attachment-filetype found type Compressed"); }   if attachment-filetype == "Executable" { log-entry("Rule attachment-filetype found type Executable"); }*      To determine which release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the **version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the **version** command for an ESA running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 8.5.7-044: ```   ciscoesa> version      Current Version   ===============   Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance   Model: X1070   Version: 8.5.7-044   .   .   .   ``` Note that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.      To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the **version** command in the WSA command-line interface (CLI). The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:      ciscowsa> **version**   Current Version   ===============   Product: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance   Model: S670   Version: 8.5.3-051   .   .   .Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are not vulnerable:   + Cisco Security Mail Appliance, both virtual and hardware versionsNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * **Message Filter Rule to Detect Malformed MIME Headers**   You can now take actions on messages with malformed MIME headers using the new message filter rule **malformed-header**. The following example shows how to quarantine all the messages with malformed MIME headers:      *quarantine\_malformed\_headers: if (malformed-header)   {   quarantine("Policy");   }*  Workarounds  * Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.  Fixed Software  * Cisco provides information about fixed software in Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID).      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 5.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 4.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 4.4 |
