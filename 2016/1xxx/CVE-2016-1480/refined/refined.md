Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1480

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) scanner of Cisco AsyncOS Software. The vulnerability stems from the software's failure to properly handle malformed MIME headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed MIME headers. This falls under CWE-20, which is Improper Input Validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured user filters on the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) or Web Security Appliance (WSA). This could allow malicious attachments or content to reach users, which would otherwise be blocked by configured filters.
- The impact is primarily a compromise of security policy enforcement since the vulnerability allows bypassing the existing filters, leading to potential compromise of the system/user in the next stage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers.
- The attack vector is through sending crafted emails or web content containing malformed MIME headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the ESA or make requests to the WSA.
- No special privileges or authentication is required on the vulnerable system itself.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides a message filter rule example to detect and quarantine messages with malformed MIME headers as a way to mitigate the vulnerability on affected systems.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ESA and WSA devices running vulnerable versions of AsyncOS software.
- The CVSS score is 5.0 base and 4.4 temporal, indicating a moderate severity vulnerability.
