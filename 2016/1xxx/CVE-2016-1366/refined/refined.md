*   The attacker must be authenticated. This implies the attacker needs valid credentials to connect via SCP or SFTP.
*   The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
*   All releases of Cisco IOS XR Software are vulnerable.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8 and temporal score of 6.5 (version 2.0), categorized as Medium severity.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-264, which refers to improper access control.
