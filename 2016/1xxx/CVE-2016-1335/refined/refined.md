Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1335:

**Root Cause:**
- A privilege escalation vulnerability exists within the SSH subsystem of Cisco ASR 5000 Series devices running StarOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability allows an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate their privileges beyond what is intended.
- It is related to improper access control (CWE-264).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could grant the attacker complete control over the affected device. This is indicated by the CVSS base score vector components: Confidentiality Impact: Complete (C:C), Integrity Impact: Complete (I:C), and Availability Impact: Complete (A:C).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation is possible (AV:N)
- The attacker needs to have a valid and configured SSH authorized key, and access to the same device from which the privileged administrator connects.
- High access complexity (AC:H), and single authentication (Au:S) is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated with a valid SSH key.
- The attacker must access the same device from which the privileged administrator connects.
- The attacker needs to have access to the same device that the privileged administrator uses.
