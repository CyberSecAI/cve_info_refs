Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-1971:

**CVE-2016-1971**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `I420VideoFrame::CreateFrame` function within the WebRTC implementation of Mozilla Firefox. The function doesn't properly check the return status of its calls to `Plane::Copy`. Specifically, if `Plane::Copy` fails due to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition, `CreateFrame` still proceeds to set the `width_` and `height_` members.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Status Check:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper error handling. The failure of a memory allocation during `Plane::Copy` should prevent the method from setting height/width, but this status is not checked, leading to inconsistent internal state.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** In cases where a new height and/or width is larger than the old one(s), other code that uses the frame data (like `ViEExternalRendererImpl::RenderFrame`) may try to access memory outside the bounds of the buffer, leading to a memory corruption. This is because allocated sizes for the image buffers (planes) do not get updated.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption caused by out-of-bounds access can lead to a denial of service due to application instability or crashes.
    *   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the official CVE description, the possibility of other unspecified impacts is mentioned, which might include the possibility of arbitrary code execution given the right conditions for exploitation. This impact is mentioned in the SUSE vulnerability rating.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **WebRTC Interaction:** The attack vector is through the WebRTC functionality of Firefox. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during video frame creation, which is part of the WebRTC workflow.
    *   **Malicious Input**: A specially crafted video stream could attempt to trigger the vulnerability by manipulating the height and width during the frame creation.
    *   **Triggering OOM:**  To trigger the vulnerability, it requires an allocation failure in `Plane::Copy`. This could be triggered by attempting to reallocate to a larger size and causing an out-of-memory condition, by using very large image planes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have a way to interact with the vulnerable Firefox instance using WebRTC. This would typically be from the network, by getting a user to interact with a malicious website or an attacker-controlled peer in a WebRTC session.
    *   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to initiate the WebRTC session and for the vulnerable code path to be reached.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   **Bugzilla:** The corresponding bug report on Bugzilla ([Bug 1217663](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1217663)) provides detailed information about the vulnerability, including the code where it occurs, and how to trigger the vulnerability for debugging and testing.
*  **Reproducibility:** The bug is reproducible by starting a firefox hello conversation with sharing tabs, increasing the size of the shared window to trigger the memory allocation and forcing the allocation failure in the debugger.
*   **Fixed Versions:** Firefox 45 and later versions contain the fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Patch:** A patch was developed that correctly checks the return status of `Plane::Copy` and doesn't set the width and height if the copy failed.

**Note:** The provided Suse content also mentions this CVE is part of the "WebRTC and LibVPX vulnerabilities" discovered and fixed together.
