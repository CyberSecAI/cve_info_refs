Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-1053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free error. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:**  The core issue is the improper handling of memory allocation and deallocation, specifically related to the `value` attribute in a listbox. A specially crafted array can cause a pointer to a memory location to be freed but subsequently accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user process. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Page/File:** The attack requires user interaction. The victim must either visit a webpage containing malicious content or open a specially crafted malicious file (likely a PDF document). The malicious content manipulates the `value` attribute in a listbox to trigger the use-after-free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious webpage or PDF document that contains the specific exploit for the vulnerability. They do not need to be present on the target system.
*   The attacker must entice the victim to open the malicious file or navigate to a malicious website.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID '22809'.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of HPE Zero Day Initiative.
