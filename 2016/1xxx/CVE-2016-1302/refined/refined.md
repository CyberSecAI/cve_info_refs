Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1302:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation of the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control: The RBAC mechanism does not properly restrict configuration changes based on the user's assigned privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated remote user can make unauthorized configuration changes. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network access: The attacker exploits the vulnerability over a network connection.
- Authentication is required but successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass the intended access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the Cisco APIC.
- The attacker must have network access to the Cisco APIC.

**Additional Information:**

- The affected products include Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switches running specific software versions prior to the fix.
- The vulnerability affects configurations using either signature-based transactions or username/password configurations.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Fixed software versions are available from Cisco.
- Cisco was not aware of any public exploits for this vulnerability at the time of publication.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
