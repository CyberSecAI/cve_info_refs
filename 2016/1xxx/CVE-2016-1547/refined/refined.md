```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A flaw in ntp_proto.c allows a preemptable client association to be demobilized by sending a crypto NAK packet with a spoofed source address.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper input validation, specifically how crypto-NAK packets are handled. The client does not properly validate the source of crypto-NAK packets, leading to state changes based on unauthenticated packets.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause denial of service by preventing the victim client from synchronizing its time. The client may also switch to interleaved mode, effectively rejecting all future legitimate server responses.
- Attack vectors: The attack is carried out by sending a crafted crypto-NAK packet with a spoofed source address of an existing peer.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An off-path attacker is required with the ability to send spoofed packets. No prior authentication is needed.
