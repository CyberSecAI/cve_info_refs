Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a security vulnerability within the Micro Focus Access Governance Suite (AGS) product. The vulnerability allows a logged-in, authenticated user to gain privileges beyond their assigned capabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege Escalation: The primary vulnerability is the ability for an authenticated user to escalate their privileges, potentially gaining system administrator access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive system functionalities and data.
- System Compromise: Successful exploitation could lead to full system compromise through administrator-level access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Authenticated User: The attack vector involves a logged-in, authenticated user within the AGS system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker must have a valid user account within the AGS environment.
- Sophisticated Understanding: The attacker requires in-depth knowledge of the AGS application architecture to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all current versions of Access Governance Suite at the time of the advisory.
- A fix is available as a configuration change e-fix (AGS-SV-eFix022416.zip) that requires restarting all application server instances in the AGS installation.
- While the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation, exploitation requires a sophisticated understanding of AGS, and no instances of actual exploitation were known by Micro Focus at the time of the advisory.
