Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1418:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the command-line interpreter of Cisco Aironet Access Points.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The access points' command-line interpreter fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands into the underlying Linux shell. This is a classic example of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with *root*-level privileges. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected access point, including:
    - Full control of the device.
    - Data exfiltration or manipulation.
    - Denial of service.
    - Further exploitation of the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have direct access to the access point's command-line interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated, local user of the access point. This suggests the attacker would need to have valid credentials.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects several models of Cisco Aironet access points including the 1830e, 1830i, 1850e, 1850i, 2800 and 3800 series running software version 8.2(100.0).
- A fix is available in software release 8.2(110.0) and later.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, users are advised to upgrade.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The CVSS base score is 6.8 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C), and temporal score is 5.6.
