Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1459

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) message processing functions of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of BGP messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network.
- The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated and have remote network access to the affected device.
- The attacker needs to send crafted BGP messages to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software that support BGP.
- Workarounds include setting a `maxpath-limit` value for BGP MIBs or suppressing use of BGP MIBs. Specific BGP MIB tables, objects, and indexes should be avoided.
- The provided CVSS vector string is `AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:U/RC:C`, indicating the following:
    - **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    - **AC:H (High):** The attack complexity is high, likely requiring specific conditions or crafted messages.
    - **Au:S (Single):** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **C:N (None):** There is no impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:N (None):** There is no impact on integrity.
    - **A:C (Complete):** The impact on availability is complete, resulting in a denial of service.
    - **E:F (Functional):** Functional exploit code is available.
    - **RL:U (Unavailable):** No official fix is available at the time of the advisory.
    - **RC:C (Confirmed):** The vulnerability has been confirmed by the vendor.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and how it could be exploited.
