Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow within the `GetUncompressedBitmapRepresentation` method in the Apple Type Services (ATS) library. The vulnerability is due to the failure to properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Improper input validation: The application fails to validate the length of user-provided data, leading to a buffer overflow.
- Heap-based buffer overflow: Writing beyond the boundaries of a heap-allocated buffer can corrupt memory and lead to further vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user.
- Potential for sensitive information leakage: The Apple advisory states a local user may be able to leak sensitive user information. The ZDI advisory focuses on arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Remote Exploitation: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by having the target visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file. This indicates the potential for remote exploitation through crafted web content or document formats.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  User Interaction: The target user is required to interact with the malicious content for the attack to succeed, whether by visiting a webpage or opening a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple on 2016-03-16.
- Apple released a patch addressing this vulnerability in "OS X El Capitan v10.11.5 and Security Update 2016-003".
- The vulnerability was discovered by "lokihardt working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative."
- CVSS v2 score of 6.8 was assigned with the vector (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) indicating Network access, Medium attack complexity, No authentication required, Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact.
