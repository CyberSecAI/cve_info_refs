Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1863:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) issue in the `IOBluetoothFamily.kext` kernel extension. This occurs when a raw pointer to a task struct is stored by `IOBluetoothHCIUserClient` without taking a reference, and then this pointer is used to build and manipulate `IOMemoryDescriptors` after the task struct has been freed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Use-After-Free:**  The `IOBluetoothHCIUserClient` stores a raw task struct pointer without taking a reference to it. The task struct can be freed when its associated task is terminated by the user, leading to the UAF.
    *   **Incorrect Pointer Handling:** The lack of proper reference counting on the task struct pointer leads to the vulnerability when accessing the freed memory.
    *   **IOKit User Client Instantiation:** The `IOServiceOpen` function can be exploited by passing an arbitrary task port which enables the use-after-free by killing the task and using the freed task struct.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use-after-free can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by manipulating the freed memory containing the task struct.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** The UAF directly leads to memory corruption by accessing freed memory that is used to manipulate IOMemoryDescriptors.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered from user space by an application through IOKit.
    *   **Task Port Manipulation:**  The vulnerability is triggered by creating a new user client and passing a task port that is controlled by the attacker to `IOServiceOpen`.
    *   **IOKit User Client Interaction:** Interaction with a specific IOKit user client (IOBluetoothHCIUserClient) by invoking an external method.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to be a local user on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **Ability to Interact with IOKit:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the IOKit framework and instantiate user clients.
    *   **Knowledge of Target User Client:** The attacker needs to know which specific user client to target and which external method to call.
    *   **Bluetooth Enabled:** The Bluetooth service must be enabled on the target system for the IOBluetoothHCIController service to exist.

**Additional Details**

*   **Affected Components:** The vulnerability resides within the `IOBluetoothFamily.kext`, a kernel extension related to Bluetooth functionality.
*   **Exploit Technique:** The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:
    1.  A child process is forked, which sends its task port to the parent.
    2.  The parent creates an `IOBluetoothHCIUserClient` using the child's task port.
    3.  The child is killed, freeing its task struct, while the parent keeps the pointer to the freed task struct.
    4.  An external method call on the user client is made, which attempts to access the freed memory.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is mitigated by applying the security updates provided by Apple in the respective releases of tvOS 9.2.2, iOS 9.3.3, watchOS 2.2.2 and OS X El Capitan v10.11.6, that address memory handling and validation in the kernel.

**Summary**

CVE-2016-1863 is a critical use-after-free vulnerability in `IOBluetoothFamily.kext` that can allow a local user to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper reference handling of task struct pointers and the ability to pass arbitrary task ports into IOKit user client creation functions. The exploit requires a local user to interact with IOKit to trigger the UAF.
