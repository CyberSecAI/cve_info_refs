```
/*
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=830

When you create a new IOKit user client from userspace you call:

  kern_return_t IOServiceOpen( io_service_t service, task_port_t owningTask, uint32_t type, io_connect_t *connect );

The owningTask mach port gets converted into a task struct pointer by the MIG deserialization code which then takes
a reference on the task, calls is_io_service_open_extended passing the task struct then drops its reference.

is_io_service_open_extended will then call through to any overriden newUserClient or initWithTask methods implemented
by the service.

If those services want to keep a pointer to the "owningTask" then it's very important that they actually take a reference.

We can actually pass any task port as the "owningTask" which means that if the userclient doesn't take a reference
we can easily pass the task port for another task, kill that task (freeing the task struct) then get the user client
to use the free'd task struct.

IOBluetoothHCIUserClient (userclient type 0 of IOBluetoothHCIController) can be instantiated by a regular user
and stores a raw task struct pointer at this+0xe0 without taking a reference.

This pointer is then used in IOBluetoothHCIUserClient::SimpleDispatchWL to build and manipulate IOMemoryDescriptors.

This PoC forks off a child which sends the parent back its task port then spins. The parent then creates a new IOBluetoothHCIUserClient
passing the child's task port as the owningTask then sigkills the child (freeing it's task struct.) The parent then invokes
an external method on the user client leading to the UaF.

The IOMemoryDescriptor code does sufficiently weird stuff with the task struct and the memory map hanging off it that
this bug is clearly exploitable as just a plain memory corruption issue but can probably be leveraged for more interesting
logic stuff too.

Note that bluetooth does have to be turned on for this PoC to work!

build: clang -o bluetooth_uaf bluetooth_uaf.c -framework IOKit

You should set gzalloc_min=1024 gzalloc_max=2048 or similar to actually fault on the UaF - otherwise you might see some weird panics!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
