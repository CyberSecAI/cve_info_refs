Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file extension access restriction filter of the TERASOLUNA Server Framework for Java(WEB). This filter, intended to block direct access to files with specified extensions, can be bypassed by sending a specially crafted path in a browser request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The framework fails to properly validate or sanitize the requested path, allowing an attacker to bypass the extension filter.
- **Access Control Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to access restricted files, violating the intended security policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information from the server. The impact depends on the specific web application and the nature of the restricted files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or special privileges. They only need to be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the server.
- **Technical Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft the specific path that bypasses the filter, implying knowledge of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects TERASOLUNA Server Framework for Java(WEB) versions 2.0.0.1 through 2.0.6.1.
- A patch (PI-SJW-261-1) has been released to address this vulnerability.
- The severity is rated as "Low" in CVSS v3 and "Medium" in CVSS v2.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-264 (Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls).
