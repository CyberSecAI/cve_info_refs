The provided content describes two vulnerabilities affecting the baserCMS "Menubook Plugin": a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2016-1169) and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2016-1170). The content is primarily focused on CVE-2016-1169.

**CVE-2016-1169 (Cross-site scripting)**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (CWE-79).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The attacker needs to inject the malicious script through a user-controlled input.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges. The user must interact with the crafted payload to trigger the vulnerability.

**CVE-2016-1170 (Cross-site request forgery)**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to perform administrative operations through a crafted request.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site request forgery (CWE-352).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform arbitrary administrative actions, such as setting alteration.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. The attacker can send a malicious request that exploits the lack of request validation.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges but must induce a logged-in administrative user to interact with a crafted malicious request.
