{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2016-1819",
    "Root cause": "A memory corruption vulnerability due to bad locking in IOAcceleratorFamily.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local application exploitation."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A malicious application running on the target system.",
    "Description": "The lock_busy/unlock_busy mechanism in IOAccelContext2::clientMemoryForType was not covering all the code setting up shared memory type 2, leading to a race condition and potential use-after-free. A thread could reach the release at +0x56AD (outside the lock) while another thread is still using those raw pages via the raw pointer at IOAccelContext+0x610 inside the locked region."
