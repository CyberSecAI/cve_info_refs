- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Apple Software Update application retrieved the contents of the updates window using an unprotected HTTP connection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of unencrypted HTTP connection for retrieving update information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in a privileged network position could potentially control the contents displayed in the updates window. This could include displaying malicious information or tricking users into downloading malicious updates.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, meaning they have the ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the user's machine and the update server.
