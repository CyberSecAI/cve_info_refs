- The presence of a default account that is not disabled or requires initial configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain access to the device.
- While not having full admin rights, the attacker can perform actions authorized to the default account which could compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- No authentication is required (Au:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the vulnerable Cisco Firepower device is located.
- No special privileges or prior knowledge beyond the default account credentials are required.
