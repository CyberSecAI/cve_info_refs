Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1569:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A typo or invalid command-line switch passed to the `gbak` utility of Firebird RDBMS via the service manager leads to a crash. Specifically, when the `gbak` utility is invoked through the service manager with an incorrect command-line parameter, the process crashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `gbak` utility does not properly handle invalid command-line parameters when invoked via the service manager.
- There's an issue within the `burp/burp.cpp` file where the error reporting mechanism was insufficient, resulting in a crash instead of a controlled error message. The fix replaces `BURP_print` with `BURP_error`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An authenticated client can crash the Firebird RDBMS server remotely, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through an authenticated connection to the Firebird RDBMS.
- **Service Manager:** The vulnerability is triggered by invoking the `gbak` utility via the service manager, a specific mode or interface for managing Firebird.
- **Invalid command line switch:** The attacker sends a crafted command to the `gbak` utility using the service manager containing an invalid command line parameter such as `USER_ALL_SPACE`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Client:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Firebird RDBMS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Firebird RDBMS version 2.5.5.
- The issue was fixed in version 2.5.6.
- The `fbsvcmgr` utility correctly handles the invalid command-line parameter by reporting an error, but `gbak` crashes the process.
- The issue is specific to usage of `gbak` with services.

The provided information gives a good insight into the vulnerability's cause, impact, and how it can be exploited. It also explains the fix that was implemented.
