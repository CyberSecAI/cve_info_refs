Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1117

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Acrobat Reader DC handles URLs passed to the `app.launchURL` function. A specially crafted cURL passed to `app.launchURL` can force the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation or sanitization of URLs passed to `app.launchURL`.
- Command injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious URLs that are then passed to the vulnerable `app.launchURL` function.
- No authentication is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted URL to the affected system, which would then be processed by `app.launchURL` in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of HPE Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe has released an update to fix this vulnerability.
