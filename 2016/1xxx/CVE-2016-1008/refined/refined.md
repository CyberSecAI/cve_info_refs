Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Adobe Acrobat Pro DC handles DLL search paths. Specifically, it can be tricked into loading a malicious DLL from a specific location controlled by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Planting:** The core weakness is a DLL planting vulnerability. This occurs because the application does not properly validate the locations from which it loads DLLs. This allows an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL that will be loaded instead of the intended one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The code runs with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application (Adobe Acrobat Pro DC).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a malicious file. This file is crafted in such a way that when processed by Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, it triggers the vulnerability and causes the malicious DLL to be loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote, as they only need to deliver the malicious file to the victim.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction; the target user must open the malicious file.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious File:** The attacker must be able to craft a file that exploits the DLL search path vulnerability within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- **Ability to Place Malicious DLL:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will attempt to load it from.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is documented as ZDI-16-190
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2015-08-03 and a patch was released by 2016-03-08.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5, which indicates a high severity.
