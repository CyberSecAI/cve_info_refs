  "CVE-2016-1245": {
    "description": "It was discovered that the zebra daemon in the Quagga routing suite suffered from a stack-based buffer overflow when processing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages. The root cause was relying on BUFSIZ to be compatible with a message size; however, BUFSIZ is system-dependent.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect buffer size handling when processing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages. The code was using `BUFSIZ` to allocate a buffer, but `BUFSIZ` is system-dependent and can be smaller than the size of the received messages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing the zebra daemon. In specific circumstances, this could allow for arbitrary code execution, although mitigations may limit the impact to DoS.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages, specifically Router Advertisement (RA) packets.",
          "The packets can be sent globally to any of the system's IPv6 addresses, using fragmentation to bypass size limits. The socket has filters limiting it to RS and RA packets, but it lacks filtering by source address or TTL.",
           "The vulnerability lies in the `rtadv_recv_packet` function within the zebra daemon code."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 packets to the target system. No authentication or user interaction is needed."
