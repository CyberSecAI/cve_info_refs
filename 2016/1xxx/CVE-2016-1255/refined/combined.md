Package        : postgresql-common
Version        : 134wheezy5

A security vulnerability and a data loss bug have been found in
postgresql-common, Debian's PostgreSQL database cluster management
tools.

CVE-2016-1255

    Dawid Golunski discovered that a symlink in /var/log/postgresql/
    could be used by the "postgres" system user to write to arbitrary
    files on the filesystem the next time PostgreSQL is started by
    root.

#614374

    RafaÅ‚ Kupka discovered that pg_upgradecluster did not properly
    upgrade databases that are owned by a non-login role (or group).

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
134wheezy5.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-common packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
