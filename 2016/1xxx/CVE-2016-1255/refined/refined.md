Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `pg_ctlcluster` script within the `postgresql-common` package not properly handling symlinks when creating log files in `/var/log/postgresql/`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symlink Vulnerability:** A symlink placed in `/var/log/postgresql/` by a local attacker can be exploited by the `postgres` system user during the startup of the PostgreSQL service by root. This allows the attacker to redirect log output to an arbitrary location on the file system.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The `pg_ctlcluster` script created log files without proper checks on the target file, leading to the ability to overwrite or create arbitrary files through a crafted symlink.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to write to arbitrary files on the filesystem, leading to potential privilege escalation by overwriting system files.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  By overwriting critical system files, a local attacker could escalate their privileges to that of the root user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, requiring an attacker to have local access to the system to create the malicious symlink.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create a symlink within `/var/log/postgresql/` prior to a PostgreSQL restart.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker requires access to the local system with the ability to create symlinks in `/var/log/postgresql/`
- **Knowledge of PostgreSQL Service Startup:** The attacker needs to know when PostgreSQL will be restarted by the root user for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski.
- The fix involves dropping privileges when creating log files in `pg_ctlcluster` to mitigate the risk associated with symlinks.
- The issue affects multiple versions of Ubuntu and Debian, requiring security updates.
- The vulnerability is addressed by commit `c8989206ec360f199400c74f129f7b4cb878c1ee` in the `postgresql-common` repository.
