Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/05/stable-channel-update_25.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, May 25, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 51 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 51.0.2704.63 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/50.0.2661.102..51.0.2704.63?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 51.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [42 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M51+type%3Dbug-security&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[614767](https://crbug.com/614767)] CVE-2016-1695: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

by a service worker even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect

MIME type. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1692](/security/CVE-2016-1692))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1695](/security/CVE-2016-1695),

[CVE-2016-1703](/security/CVE-2016-1703))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent frame navigation during

DocumentLoader detach operations. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1697](/security/CVE-2016-1697))

A parameter sanitization bug was discovered in the devtools subsystem in

Blink. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended

access restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1699](/security/CVE-2016-1699))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

# CVE-2016-1692

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1691.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1693.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1692 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1692)

#### Description

WebKit/Source/core/css/StyleSheetContents.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.63, permits cross-origin loading of CSS stylesheets by a ServiceWorker even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect MIME type, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site.

# [R7] LCE 4.8.1 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

The Log Correlation Engine (LCE) is potentially impacted by several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (20160503), libpcre / PCRE, Libxml2, Handlebars, libcurl, and jQuery that were recently disclosed and fixed. Note that due to the time involved in doing a full analysis of each issue, Tenable has opted to upgrade the included versions of each library as a precaution, and to save time. These vulnerabilities **may** impact LCE and include:

* OpenSSL ASN.1 Encoder Negative Zero Value Handling Remote Memory Corruption
* OpenSSL crypto/evp/encode.c EVP\_EncodeUpdate() Function Heap Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL AES-NI CBC MAC Check Padding Oracle MitM Information Disclosure

* cURL / libcurl lib/vtls/vtls.c Curl\_ssl\_config\_matches() Function TLS Connection Reuse Cross-realm Information Disclosure
* jQuery Core ajax/script.js Third-party Text Handling XSS

Tenable's Log Correlation Engine (LCE) was found to be impacted by an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad and discovered internally. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

[R5 Update] LCE was also found to be vulnerable to a second authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found internally by Rich Walchuck and was inadvertently left out of the advisory at publication. This is designated as LCE-4806 for tracking purposes.

Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that LCE be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has released LCE version 4.8.1 to address the issues above. Download the appropriate installation file to the system hosting LCE, available at the Tenable Support Portal (<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=180>).
