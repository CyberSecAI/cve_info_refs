| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco TelePresence XML Application Programming Interface Authentication Bypass Vulnerability Critical   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160504-tpxml  First Published: 2016 May 4 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuz26935](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz26935)     CVE-2016-1387        CVSS Score: [Base 9.0, Temporal 7.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2016-1387        Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the XML application programming interface (API) of Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and access a targeted system through the API.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco TelePresence Software releases TC 7.2.0, TC 7.2.1, TC 7.3.0, TC 7.3.1, TC 7.3.2, TC 7.3.3, TC 7.3.4, TC 7.3.5, CE 8.0.0, CE 8.0.1, and CE 8.1.0 running on the following Cisco products:   + TelePresence EX Series   + TelePresence Integrator C Series   + TelePresence MX Series   + TelePresence Profile Series   + TelePresence SX Series   + TelePresence SX Quick Set Series   + TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant   + TelePresence VX Tactical   **Determining the Cisco TelePresence Software Release**      To determine which Cisco TelePresence Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can check the system information on the local touch control device or on-screen via the infrared (IR) remote controller.      Administrators can also determine which software release is running by logging in to the web interface and using the **http(s)://** command or, via the external API (xAPI) with the SSH protocol, using the **ssh admin@** command. After logging in to the web interface, the welcome text displays information about the software release that is running on the device.         For example, the following welcome text appears for a Cisco TelePresence Magnus SX80 codec that is running software release CE 8.2.0: ```   Welcome to Magnus SX80   Cisco Codec Release ce 8.2.0 PreAlpha1 c6612ca 2016-04-25   SW Release Date: 2016-04-25 14:58:45, matchbox   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:   + TelePresence IX5000 Series   + TelePresence System 500 Series   + TelePresence System 3000 Series   + TelePresence System T Series   + TelePresence TX Series  Workarounds  * To work around this vulnerability, administrators can disable the XML API on an affected system. However, this API is used by the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS), which means that administrators will not be able to manage the system by using TMS if they disable the API.      To disable the XML API, do the following in the web interface of the software:   1. Navigate to **xConfig > NetworkServices > XMLAPI > Mode**.   2. Change the **Mode** setting to **Off**.   Reboot the main device for the new configuration to take effect. The device can be rebooted from the local touch control device or the IR remote controller.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>      Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at [http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt](http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt%20) and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.      **Customers Without Service Contracts**      Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>      Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.      **Fixed Releases**      This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software releases TC 7.3.6 and CE 8.1.1.      Cisco TelePresence Software can be downloaded from the [Software Center on Cisco.com](http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html%20) by navigating to **Products > Video > Cisco TelePresence**.
