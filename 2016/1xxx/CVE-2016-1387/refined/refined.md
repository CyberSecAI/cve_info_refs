Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-1387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the XML application programming interface (API) of Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms when accessing the system through the XML API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system via the API.
- The attacker can achieve partial confidentiality and integrity impact and complete availability impact on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **XML API:** The vulnerability lies within the XML API of the affected Cisco TelePresence systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system's XML API, and no authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco TelePresence Software releases TC 7.2.0, TC 7.2.1, TC 7.3.0, TC 7.3.1, TC 7.3.2, TC 7.3.3, TC 7.3.4, TC 7.3.5, CE 8.0.0, CE 8.0.1, and CE 8.1.0 running on various TelePresence products such as EX Series, Integrator C Series, MX Series, Profile Series, SX Series, SX Quick Set Series, VX Clinical Assistant, and VX Tactical.
- **Workaround:** The XML API can be disabled via the web interface of the software. However, disabling it will impact management through Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS).
- **Fixed Releases:** This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software releases TC 7.3.6 and CE 8.1.1.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 9.0 and a temporal score of 7.4 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C).
- **Exploitation:**  Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
