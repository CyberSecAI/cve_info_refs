Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) generic routing encapsulation (GRE) implementation of Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches. Specifically, it's related to how the OTV feature handles GRE packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the OTV implementation when processing GRE packets. This can be triggered by specially crafted OTV control packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can also lead to a reload of the affected system, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who is adjacent to the network where the vulnerable device is connected.
- **Unauthenticated Attack:**  The attacker does not need any form of authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They can send crafted OTV packets to the vulnerable switch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable Cisco Nexus 7000 or 7700 switch or be able to send packets to it.
- **Ability to Craft Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send malformed OTV control packets with specific characteristics to trigger the overflow.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require valid credentials or access to the device before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 series switches when the OTV feature is enabled (introduced with Cisco NX-OS Software Release 5.0(3) or later for Nexus 7000 and 6.2(2) or later for Nexus 7700).
- The provided CVSS vector string indicates a critical severity (Base Score 10.0) with Network access (AV:N), Low access complexity (AC:L), No authentication required (Au:N) and Complete impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (C:C/I:C/A:C).
- A workaround using an Access Control List (ACL) is available, this helps mitigate the vulnerability by blocking malformed OTV control packets. This workaround should be applied on the ingress ACL for the OTV join interface.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to the fixed versions specified in the advisory.
- Exploitation might lead to ISIS core files being generated on the affected device.
