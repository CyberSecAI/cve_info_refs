# nghttp2: Denial of service — GLSA **201612-13**

Nghttp2 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/nghttp2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.1** |

### Background

Nghttp2 is an implementation of HTTP/2 and its header compression
algorithm HPACK in C.

### Description

Nghttpd, nghttp, and libnghttp2\_asio applications do not limit the
memory usage for the incoming HTTP header field. If a peer sends a
specially crafted HTTP/2 HEADERS frame and CONTINUATION frame, they will
crash with an out of memory error.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nghttp2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/nghttp2-1.7.1"

```

# Security Advisory

[CVE-2016-1544](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-32wx-5655-89rw "CVE-2016-1544"): Out of memory in nghttpd, nghttp, and libnghttp2\_asio applications due

to unlimited incoming HTTP header fields.

## Vulnerability

nghttpd, nghttp, and libnghttp2\_asio applications do not limit the

memory usage for the incoming HTTP header field. If peer sends

specially crafted HTTP/2 HEADERS frames and CONTINUATION frames, they

will crash with out of memory error.

HTTP/2 uses HPACK to compress header fields. The basic idea is that

HTTP header field is stored in the receiver with the numeric index

number. The memory used by this storage is tightly constrained, and

it is 4KiB by default. When sender sends the same header field, it

just sends the corresponding numeric index number, which is usually 1

or 2 bytes. This means that after sender makes the receiver store the

relatively large header field (e.g., 4KiB), and it can send specially

crafted HEADERS/CONTINUATION frames which contain a lot of references

to the stored header field, sender easily effectively send lots of big

header fields to the receiver quite easily. nghttpd, nghttp, and

libnghttp2\_asio applications do not limit the memory usage for

received header fields, so if the peer performs the procedure

described above, they will crash due to out of memory.

Note that libnghttp2 itself is not affected by this vulnerability.

## Affected Versions

* Affected versions: nghttp2 <= 1.7.0
* Not affected versions: nghttp2 >= 1.7.1

## The Solution

Install nghttp2 v1.7.1

## Time Line

It was first reported to the nghttp2 team February 3 2016.

nghttp2 v1.7.1 was released on February 11 2016.

## Credits

Reported by Noam Mazor. Fixed by the nghttp2 team.

Thank you for all who involved.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1308461#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-02-15 09:48:48 UTC  ```  A vulnerability was found in a way nghttp2 processes incoming packets. Nghttpd, nghttp, and libnghttp2_asio applications do not limit the memory usage for the incoming HTTP header field. If peer sends specially crafted HTTP/2 HEADERS frames and CONTINUATION frames, they will crash with out of memory error.  Upstream report and fix:  <https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/nghttp2/releases/tag/v1.7.1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1308461#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-02-15 09:49:31 UTC  ```  Created nghttp2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1308463](show_bug.cgi?id=1308463 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-1544 nghttp2: out of memory error due to unlimited incoming HTTP header fields [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1308461#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2016-02-15 09:53:11 UTC  ```  Created nghttp2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1308467](show_bug.cgi?id=1308467 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-1544 nghttp2: out of memory error due to unlimited incoming HTTP header fields [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1308461#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2016-02-15 15:38:58 UTC  ``` The fix seems to be spread across multiple commits.  The changes between 1.7.0 and 1.7.1 seem almost limited to this issue:  <https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/nghttp2/compare/v1.7.0...v1.7.1>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1308461#c6)  Fedora Update System    2016-02-17 03:49:24 UTC  ``` nghttp2-1.7.1-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1308461#c8)  Fedora Update System    2016-02-22 20:50:13 UTC  ``` nghttp2-1.7.1-1.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1308461#c9)  Fedora Update System    2016-02-29 20:56:23 UTC  ``` nghttp2-1.7.1-1.el7 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 7 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
