### Summary of Vulnerability Information from Provided Content:

**CVE-2016-1544** is a vulnerability affecting `nghttp2` versions prior to 1.7.1. It is a denial-of-service vulnerability due to memory exhaustion.

**Root Cause:**
- The `nghttpd`, `nghttp`, and `libnghttp2_asio` applications do not limit the memory used for incoming HTTP header fields.
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper memory management when processing HTTP/2 HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames, specifically those with references to stored header fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unbounded memory allocation:  The applications fail to restrict the memory consumption when receiving HTTP header fields.
- HTTP/2 HPACK compression: An attacker can exploit the header compression mechanism in HTTP/2 (HPACK), specifically the numeric index reference, to send large amounts of header data by referencing a single large header field multiple times. This causes excessive memory consumption on the receiving end.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting the server's memory. This leads to the application crashing due to an out-of-memory error.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: A remote peer can send crafted HTTP/2 HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames.
- Specially crafted HTTP/2 packets: The attack involves sending specifically designed HTTP/2 packets to exploit the lack of memory limits when handling header fields and references.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the vulnerable server.
- No special privileges are required, and the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `libnghttp2` itself is not affected, only applications utilizing it.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves limiting the incoming request header buffer sizes.
- The issue was reported to the nghttp2 team on February 3, 2016, and version 1.7.1, which contains the fix, was released on February 11, 2016.
- The vulnerability is rated as "low severity" by GitHub.
