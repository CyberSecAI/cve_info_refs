- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A state management issue existed when accessing Siri results on the lock screen.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper state management, allowing access to sensitive information while the device is locked.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A person with physical access to an iOS device may be able to use Siri to access contacts and photos from the lock screen.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to a locked iOS device is required. The attacker interacts with Siri to access the sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the locked device.
