Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1380

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from how Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) parses HTTP POST requests. An error in the parsing process can cause the proxy process to become unresponsive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper handling of HTTP POST requests.
*   Denial-of-service due to proxy process unresponsiveness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) - The primary impact is that a successful attack renders the Cisco Web Security Appliance's proxy service unresponsive, disrupting normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote network-based attack - The attacker does not need to be on the same network.
*   The attack involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable appliance.
*   No authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco WSA.
*   No specific access or privileges are needed besides the ability to send network requests.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects both virtual and hardware appliances running vulnerable versions of Cisco AsyncOS for WSA.
*   The advisory provides a command to check the running version of Cisco AsyncOS on the WSA.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8 and a temporal score of 6.4.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   The exploit is considered functional meaning code that works in most situations where the vulnerability exists is available.
