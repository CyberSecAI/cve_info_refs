Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager SQL database interface. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the system handles SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the system's queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access and view sensitive data within the database, resulting in a loss of confidentiality.
- The CVSS score indicates a partial impact on confidentiality (C:P), with no impact on integrity or availability (I:N/A:N).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the system.
- **Network (AV:N):** The attack vector is through the network, indicating the vulnerability is exploitable over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (Au:S) to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates that the attacker would likely need valid credentials to access the affected system.
- **Low Access Complexity:** The attack has low complexity (AC:L), suggesting that the vulnerability is not difficult to exploit once the attacker has access.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Product:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager release 10.5(2.13900.9) is vulnerable.
- **Exploit Status:**  Functional exploit code is available (E:F).
- **Remediation:** The vulnerability can be fixed by applying a software update. There are no workarounds available.
- **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS score is 4.0 and temporal score is 3.8.
- The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor (RC:C).
