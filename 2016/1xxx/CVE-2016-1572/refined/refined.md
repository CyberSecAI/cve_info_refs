        "URL": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=962052",
        "RootCause": "The setuid-root mount.ecryptfs_private helper in the ecryptfs-utils would mount over any target directory that the user owns, including a directory in procfs.",
        "Vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that `mount.ecryptfs_private` doesn't validate the filesystem type of the mount destination. This allows mounting on top of special filesystems like `/proc/$pid`.",
        "Impact": "A local attacker could use this flaw to escalate privileges by mounting over /proc/<PID> and crafting malicious files that could be parsed by privileged processes, potentially leading to code execution.",

         "URL": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=920160",
         "RootCause": "The wrapping key, derived from the user password, is hashed using a fixed salt, making it susceptible to rainbow table attacks.",
        "Vulnerability": "The vulnerability resides in the use of a default fixed salt for encrypting the mount passphrase, which significantly reduces the complexity of offline precomputation attacks.",
        "Impact": "Attackers can potentially crack user passwords through time-memory trade-off techniques such as rainbow tables or bulk dictionary attacks.",
        "AttackVector": "Offline, leveraging compromised or leaked encrypted data.",
         "AttackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs access to the wrapped-passphrase file.",
        "PatchInformation": "The fix introduces a new passphrase wrapping format that combines a randomly generated salt with the wrapping password (typically the user's login password) before key strengthening."
