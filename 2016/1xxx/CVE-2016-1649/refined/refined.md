  "CVE-2016-1649": {
    "description": "The Program::getUniformInternal function in Program.cpp in libANGLE, as used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.108, does not properly handle a certain data-type mismatch, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted shader stages.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Data-type mismatch in libANGLE's Program::getUniformInternal function when handling shader stages leads to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Improper Data Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting a buffer overflow when processing crafted shader stages.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
        "Malicious website",
        "Crafted shader stages"
