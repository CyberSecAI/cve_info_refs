  "CVE-2016-1617": {
    "description": "The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.82, does not apply http policies to https URLs and does not apply ws policies to wss URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink's `CSPSource::schemeMatches` function does not properly distinguish between HTTP and HTTPS URLs or WS and WSS URLs during policy matching.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inconsistent handling of schemes in CSP implementation",
        "History sniffing vulnerability through CSP reports"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially determine if a user has visited a specific HSTS website by observing CSP reports.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "A malicious website can exploit this vulnerability by using CSP to monitor if a user has visited an HSTS website."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious website that uses CSP to track history."
