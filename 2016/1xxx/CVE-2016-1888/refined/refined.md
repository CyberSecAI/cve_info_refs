- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A combination of memory allocation failures and insufficient error checking in `telnetd(8)` when constructing command line arguments for `login(1)` (or a similar program specified by the -p argument).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient error handling during memory allocation and argument construction, leading to the possibility of constructing an unintended argument sequence for `login(1)`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who can control memory allocation failures can cause `login(1)` to execute without proper authentication and potentially cause misbehavior of `login(1)` replacements.
- **Attack vectors:** Network connection to the telnet service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control the sequence of memory allocation failures. However, the advisory states that "No practical way of controlling these memory allocation failures is known at this time." The attacker would need to connect to the telnet service.
