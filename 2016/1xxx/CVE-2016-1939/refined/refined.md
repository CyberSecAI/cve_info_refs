  "CVE-2016-1939": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 44.0 stores cookies with names containing vertical tab characters, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading HTTP Cookie headers. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7208.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Firefox not properly sanitizing cookie names by not disallowing vertical tab characters.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Sanitization",
         "Cookie Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could obtain sensitive information by reading HTTP Cookie headers because the browser stores cookies with names containing vertical tab characters. This issue also allows for cookie injection attacks on some web servers.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted website that sets a cookie with a name containing a vertical tab character. When the browser sends the cookie back to the server, the vertical tab may be interpreted as a newline, leading to potential issues on the server side and possible extraction of cookies.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft a malicious website that sets a cookie with a name containing a vertical tab character."
