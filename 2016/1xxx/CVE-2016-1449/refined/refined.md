Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1449

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Reflected XSS (CWE-79) vulnerability. This means the server does not properly sanitize user-provided input before reflecting it back to the user in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can perform reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing session cookies)
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Phishing attacks by presenting fake login forms

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote and via the network (AV:N).
*   An attacker sends a malicious request to the vulnerable application. This request contains malicious script code.
*   The application reflects this unsanitized input back to the user's browser, causing the malicious code to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate to perform the attack (Au:N).
*   The attack complexity is medium (AC:M), possibly because it requires careful crafting of the malicious input.
*   The attacker can be remote from the target.

**Additional Information:**
*   Affected product: Cisco WebEx Meetings Server version 2.6
*   Workarounds: No workarounds are available.
*   Exploitability: Functional exploit code is available (E:F).
*   Remediation Level: An official fix is available (RL:OF).
*   Report Confidence: The vulnerability is confirmed by the vendor (RC:C).
*   CVSS Base Score: 4.3
*   CVSS Temporal Score: 3.6
