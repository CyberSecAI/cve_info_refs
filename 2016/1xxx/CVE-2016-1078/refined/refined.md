Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1078

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Acrobat Reader DC handles JPEG2000 files.
- Specifically, the application fails to properly validate the `numcomps` field within the `ihdr` tag of a JPEG2000 file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: By providing a crafted JPEG2000 file with an invalid `numcomps` value, an attacker can cause the application to read beyond the allocated memory.
- Information Disclosure: This out-of-bounds read can be exploited to leak the content of adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can disclose sensitive information from the memory of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG2000 file to the user.
- This can be done by:
    - Tricking the user into opening a malicious PDF containing the crafted JPEG2000 file.
    - Luring the user to visit a malicious web page that uses the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious JPEG2000 file to the target system.
- This can be done remotely, via email, web page, etc.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
- User interaction is required (the user has to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page).
- Adobe has released an update to patch this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is classified as a memory corruption vulnerability in the Adobe Security Bulletin.
