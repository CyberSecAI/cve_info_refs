  "CVE-2016-1651": {
    "description": "fxcodec/codec/fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp in PDFium, as used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.75, does not properly implement the sycc420_to_rgb and sycc422_to_rgb functions, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted JPEG 2000 data in a PDF document.",
    "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the Pdfium JPEG2000 decoding component within Chromium. Specifically, the `sycc420_to_rgb` and `sycc422_to_rgb` functions within `fxcodec/codec/fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp` are not correctly implemented, leading to the potential for out-of-bounds memory access when processing crafted JPEG2000 data embedded in a PDF document.",
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially leak sensitive information from process memory due to out-of-bounds read. Alternatively, exploitation could cause a denial-of-service due to an out-of-bounds read operation.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote. A specially crafted JPEG2000 image embedded inside a PDF can be used to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to create or modify PDF documents to include specially crafted JPEG2000 data.",
