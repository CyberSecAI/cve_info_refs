Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-1464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of an invalid JPG image within a WRF (Webex Recording Format) file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free Memory Corruption:** The flaw allows an attacker to trigger a use-after-free condition, where memory that has been freed is accessed again, leading to potential corruption.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the JPG data within the WRF file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process running the vulnerable Webex Player. This means an attacker can potentially gain control of the user's system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly mentioned in the Cisco advisory, the exploit-db entry categorizes it as a DoS. It is possible that under some circumstances the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious WRF File:** The primary attack vector is a crafted WRF file containing a malformed JPG image.
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, as stated in the Cisco advisory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafted WRF File:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a WRF file with a specifically crafted, invalid JPG image to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Target User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious WRF file with the vulnerable Cisco Webex Player. This likely would involve some sort of social engineering attack, to entice the user to open the malicious file.
