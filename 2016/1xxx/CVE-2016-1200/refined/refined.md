Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a failure to properly restrict access permissions within the EC-CUBE system, specifically in the management interface. This allows logged-in users to bypass intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper authorization checks, allowing users with low privileges to perform actions they shouldn't be able to, such as bypassing access restrictions or deleting access control settings.
- **Broken Access Control (CWE-264):**  The vulnerability falls under the category of broken access control, where the system does not adequately verify if a user is authorized to perform a given action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass Access Restrictions:** An attacker can circumvent the configured access control mechanisms, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive functions within the management interface.
- **Delete Access Restriction Settings:**  An attacker can remove existing access control configurations, potentially leading to even broader unauthorized access.
- **Confidentiality and Integrity Impact:**  The impact includes low confidentiality and integrity damage. An attacker may be able to view sensitive information or modify data.
- **No Availability Impact:** Exploitation of this vulnerability does not directly lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be a logged in user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privilege Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with low privileges to gain access to the management interface.

**Affected Products:**

- EC-CUBE versions 3.0.7 to 3.0.9
