{
  "CVE-2016-1658": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CveID": "CVE-2016-1658",
      "Description": "The Extensions subsystem in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.75 incorrectly relies on GetOrigin method calls for origin comparisons, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and obtain sensitive information via a crafted extension."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Incorrect reliance on the `GetOrigin` method for origin comparisons within the Extensions subsystem of Google Chrome. `GURL::GetOrigin` does not do the right thing for all types of URLs.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect same-origin policy enforcement",
        "Use of a flawed method for origin comparison"
      ],
      "Impact": "Potential leak of sensitive information to malicious extensions. By bypassing the same-origin policy, a malicious extension could gain access to data that should have been protected.",
      "Attack Vectors": "A crafted malicious extension is used to exploit the flawed origin comparison mechanism.",
      "Required Capabilities": "Attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious extension that leverages the vulnerability. The user needs to install this extension.",
      "Additional Information": "The issue is due to the Extensions subsystem incorrectly relying on GetOrigin method calls for origin comparisons. The fix involved updating the subsystem to use the correct method for origin comparison."
