Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1842:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the MapKit framework sending shared links using HTTP instead of HTTPS.
*   **Weakness:** The use of HTTP for sharing links exposes sensitive information to potential interception and eavesdropping.
*   **Impact:** An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to leak sensitive user information by intercepting the HTTP traffic.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to be in a position to monitor network traffic.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, such as an on-path attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network.

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerability affects iOS, watchOS, and macOS.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was addressed by enabling HTTPS for shared links in MapKit.
