Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a code injection flaw in the `supportconfig` data collection tool within the `supportutils` package. This is due to unescaped filenames being used within the tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Code Injection:** The `supportconfig` tool does not properly sanitize or escape filenames, allowing a malicious filename to inject code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `supportconfig`. This is typically root, thus granting full system control.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Because the attacker can execute code as root, this can lead to privilege escalation if the attacker has lower privileges initially.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where `supportconfig` is running.
- **Malicious Filenames:** The attack is triggered by creating files with crafted, malicious filenames which are then processed by `supportconfig`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the target system.
- **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to the filesystem to create the files with malicious filenames.
- **Knowledge of Tool:** The attacker needs knowledge of how `supportconfig` processes filenames and the specific code injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is considered to have a moderate severity.
* The vulnerability affects SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 12 SP1, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 12 and 12 SP1.
* Patches for this vulnerability have been released.
* The vulnerability is identified as  `bsc#980670` in SUSE's bug tracking system.
