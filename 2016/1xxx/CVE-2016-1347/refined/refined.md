Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of TCP segments by the Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature in Cisco IOS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of TCP segments.
- Vulnerable function is an output feature of the software

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload.
- This reload results in a denial of service (DoS) condition, disrupting network operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to route a crafted TCP segment through an egress interface of a device.
- The WAAS Express feature must be enabled on the interface, typically a WAN interface.
- In most deployments, the crafted traffic must be initiated from within a device to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send crafted TCP segments to the affected device.
- The attacker must be able to route the traffic through an egress interface where WAAS is enabled.
- Unauthenticated and remote attacker
