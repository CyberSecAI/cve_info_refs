Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an access restriction bypass in Cybozu Office, allowing unauthorized access to information. Specifically, users not included in the participant list can access/manipulate information within non-public scheduled appointments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control: The application fails to properly enforce access restrictions, allowing users outside the intended group to interact with non-public scheduled information.
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows unauthorized viewing of sensitive, non-public appointment details.
- Data Manipulation: The flaw allows unauthorized manipulation of non-public schedule information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Information Access: An attacker can view non-public schedule information.
- Data Modification: An attacker might be able to alter non-public schedule details.
- Potential for further attacks: An authenticated user might be able to gain privileged information or render specific functions unusable

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: Exploitation can occur remotely over the network.
- Authentication required: Access to the vulnerable functionality requires being logged into the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system.
- User Account: An attacker needs to have a user account to log in and exploit the vulnerability.
- Unspecified privileges: Depending on the context an attacker can be a normal user or potentially a more privileged user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cybozu Office versions 9.9.0 to 10.3.0.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Cybozu Office 10.4.0 and later.
- The Cybozu advisory specifies the vulnerability as "CyVDB-978".
- The advisory suggests that external attacks are unlikely given that the attacker has to be logged in.
- CVSS v3 score is 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L), implying that an attacker with low privileges can perform this attack over the network without user interaction, with a low impact on confidentiality, availability, and no impact on integrity.
- CVSS v2 score is 5.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P), an attacker with single authentication can partially affect confidentiality and availability over the network without much complexity.
