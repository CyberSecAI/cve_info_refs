{
  "CVE-2016-1636": {
    "Description": "The PendingScript::notifyFinished function in WebKit/Source/core/dom/PendingScript.cpp in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.75 relies on memory-cache information about integrity-check occurrences instead of integrity-check successes, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Subresource Integrity (aka SRI) protection mechanism by triggering two loads of the same resource.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the `PendingScript::notifyFinished` function relying on cached information about integrity checks, indicating that a check occurred, but not if it passed or failed. This leads to a flawed re-use of cached resources.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect use of cached data.",
      "Bypass of Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the Subresource Integrity (SRI) protection mechanism.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by triggering two loads of the same resource.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious resource and trigger a victim to load this resource twice, likely through a crafted website."
