### CVE-2016-1949

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper interaction between Service Workers and plugins in Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, service workers were able to intercept network requests initiated by plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Same-Origin Policy Violation:** The core weakness is the ability of service workers to intercept and modify responses to plugin-initiated network requests. This bypasses the same-origin policy, which normally restricts how scripts from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.
*   **Plugin Trust:** Plugins rely on the integrity of network responses. When service workers can intercept and alter responses, plugins may make decisions based on spoofed information, potentially leading to security breaches.
*   **Crossdomain.xml Manipulation:** The specific example given involves the `crossdomain.xml` file used by the Flash plugin. By intercepting and forging this file, a malicious service worker can allow a Flash plugin from a different origin to bypass security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Security Restrictions:** An attacker could bypass same-origin policy restrictions by manipulating the network responses to plugins.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** As plugins may execute code according to the retrieved network resources, this can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on a user's machine.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By manipulating the `crossdomain.xml` file or similar plugin security files, an attacker can trick plugins into exposing sensitive data, such as cookies or other user information, to malicious sites.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** The ability to intercept plugin network requests may allow for MitM attacks where the attacker can inject malicious content or redirect the flow of network requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Web Pages:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage with a service worker that intercepts plugin requests.
*  **Plugin Exploitation:** A specially crafted web page could utilize a vulnerable plugin and a service worker to trick the plugin into acting maliciously.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker might use social engineering techniques to lure a user to a vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, needing only to host the malicious webpage.
*  **Service Worker Registration:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a webpage that registers a malicious service worker.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Behavior:**  The attacker needs to understand how a vulnerable plugin behaves.
*   **Targeted Browsers:** The attack targets browsers with vulnerable versions of Firefox and the plugin.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was initially triggered by a flash video not playing correctly when a service worker was in control, which was later discovered to be a security issue.
*   The fix involved making plugin network requests bypass service worker interception, specifically by adding the `LOAD_BYPASS_SERVICE_WORKER` flag to prevent interception.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Firefox, including 44, 45, 46 and 47.
*   The vulnerability was also present in the mobile version (Fennec) as well.
*   The issue also affected ESR versions of Firefox.
*  The root cause seems similar to an issue in chromium (<https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=413094>).
