{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Tomcat init script performed unsafe file handling by using `chown` on the `catalina.out` log file after creating it with `touch` without checking if it is a symlink.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local privilege escalation",
      "Unsafe file handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with tomcat user privileges can create a symlink to any file on the system and when the init script chowns the symlinked file, the attacker can take ownership of that file. This allows a malicious tomcat user to potentially escalate privileges to root.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A local user that has access to the tomcat user",
      "A user that has compromised a web application running in tomcat"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system, specifically as the tomcat user or by compromising a web application running on tomcat which will grant access to the tomcat user account.",
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the init scripts used by Debian-based distributions. The vulnerability can be triggered when the tomcat service is restarted, or when the machine reboots. Exploitation can be achieved by simply creating a symlink in place of the target log file before restart."
