BlackBerry Enterprise Service 12 (BES12) Self-Service
Affected versions: BES12 < 12.4

CVE: CVE-2016-1914 and CVE-2016-1915

PDF:
<http://security-assessment.com/files/documents/advisory/Blackberry%20BES12%20Self-Service%20Multiple%20Vulnerabilities.pdf>

+-----------+
|Description|
+-----------+

Blackberry BES12 is an enterprise mobile management solution and
contains a self-service web application available to mobile users. This
web application contains multiple vulnerabilities including
unauthenticated SQL
injection and reflected cross site scripting.

Limited access to an on-premise BES12 environment was provided during
the discovery of these vulnerabilities. The full impact of the
vulnerabilities in relation to compromising other portions of the BES12
solution, such as mobile devices, is unclear.

+------------+
|Exploitation|
+------------+

*SQL Injection*

The Java servlet com.rim.mdm.ui.server.ImageServlet is vulnerable to SQL
injection via the imageName parameter. This servlet is exposed at
multiple paths and is used to fetch an image from the database:

/mydevice/client/image
/admin/client/image
/myapps/client/image
/ssam/client/image
/all/client/image

This was discovered on a production BES12 on-premise deployment and the
injection vector allowed both UNION and stacked queries to be executed
on the Microsoft SQL server used by BES12. This allows full read/write
access to the database, and can potentially result in command execution
via xp_cmdshell depending on the database user configuration.

The following proof of concept demonstrates an injection payload which
will select the entire obj_keystore_entry table. The query will
serialise the entire table into an XML document which is returned in the
HTTP response as UTF-16 without the leading BOM (byte order mark)
causing most text editors to fail to display the response correctly.

https://<server>/mydevice/client/image?imageName=ui.cobranded.login.logo'+UNION+ALL+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,(SELECT+*+FROM+obj_keystore_entry+FOR+XML+PATH(''))+--

The technique above can be used to download any database table available
to the BES12 database user.

Notable database tables are:
* obj_user which contains BES12 user details.
* obj_user_authentication which contains authentication tokens.
* obj_user_device which based on column names, contains enrolment
tokens, enrolment secrets and device encryption keys.

It is unclear if this information is sufficient to decrypt a lost/stolen
BES12 mobile device.

*Reflected Cross Site Scripting*

Two areas of the self-service web application exist where user-supplied
input is reflected directly in web pages, allowing a malicious user to
conduct Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against users of the
application. While the application uses the HttpOnly cookie flag for
session tokens, successful exploitation allows malicious JavaScript to
perform any action within the application that the targeted user is able
to. The administrative web application is typically hosted on the same
domain and may be attacked using these XSS vectors, although this is
BES12 deployment specific.

The table below details where Cross Site Scripting was detected and
which parameters are vulnerable:

https://<server>/mydevice/index.jsp?locale="><script>alert(1)</script>
https://<server>/mydevice/loggedOut.jsp?locale="><script>alert(1)</script>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
