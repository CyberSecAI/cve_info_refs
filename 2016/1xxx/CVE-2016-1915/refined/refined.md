Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-1915:

**CVE-2016-1915:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BlackBerry Enterprise Service 12 (BES12) Self-Service web application.

* **Root Cause:** The application reflects user-supplied input directly in web pages without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `locale` parameter in the `index.jsp` and `loggedOut.jsp` pages.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they visit a maliciously crafted link.
    *   This could lead to:
        *   Session hijacking (even with HttpOnly cookies, as JavaScript can still perform actions within the app).
        *   Information disclosure or unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user.
        *   Potential compromise of the administrative web application if it shares the same domain (deployment-specific).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious links sent to users that contain the injected JavaScript payload in the `locale` parameter.
    *   The attack is reflected; the malicious script is not stored on the server, but rather executed upon loading the page with the malicious URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code.
    *   The attacker needs to get the victim to visit the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content also details another vulnerability, SQL injection (CVE-2016-1914), in the same application.
* The affected component is the self-service web application of Blackberry BES12.
* The specific vulnerable parameters are `locale` in `index.jsp` and `loggedOut.jsp`.
* The advisory specifies that BES12 versions prior to 12.4 are affected by this vulnerability.
