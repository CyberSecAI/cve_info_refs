  "CVE-2016-1978": {
    "description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the way NSS handled DHE (Diffie-Hellman key exchange) and ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange) handshake messages. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted handshake message that, when parsed by an application linked against NSS, would cause that application to crash or, under certain special conditions, execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running the application.",
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of memory after a failed allocation during DHE/ECDHE handshake messages processing.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the vulnerable NSS library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted handshake message to trigger the use-after-free."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a service using the vulnerable NSS library. The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path (e.g., by initiating an SSL handshake). Low memory conditions might be required."
