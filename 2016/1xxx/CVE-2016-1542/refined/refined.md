Based on the analyzed content, here's information about CVE-2016-1542:

*   **Vulnerability:** Weak access control in BMC Server Automation RSCD agent allows unauthenticated arbitrary operating system command execution.

*   **Root Cause:** The RSCD agent doesn't properly validate the "Server intro" data (IP, role, username). Even if the data is invalid, it doesn't stop processing subsequent requests.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Attacker sends an initial "TLS" or "TLSRPC" packet to initiate SSL communication.
    2.  Attacker sends a "Server intro" packet with potentially invalid or unauthorized credentials (IP, role, username).
    3.  The RSCD agent responds with a "No authorization" message, but continues processing requests.
    4.  The attacker sends a malicious request such as one to change the password of the root user.
    5.  The RSCD agent executes the request, potentially leading to a compromised system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Command Execution: Allows arbitrary OS commands to be executed on the target system.
    *   Password Change: Allows changing passwords of system users, including root.
    *   User Enumeration: Allows retrieving all users on the system.
    *   Compromised Systems: Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the target system.

*   **Affected Component:** BMC BladeLogic RSCD agent.

*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target RSCD agent (default port 4750). No prior authentication is required.

*   **Details beyond CVE Description:**
    *   The vulnerability exists because RSCD doesn't terminate the connection/session after an authorization failure.
    *   The communication between the components (Control Server, Application Server, Target Servers) uses TLS 1.0.
    *   Exploits are available that can change system user passwords or enumerate users.
    *   The RSCD agent implements a web server functionality using XMLRPC to handle HTTP POST requests containing commands from the application server.
