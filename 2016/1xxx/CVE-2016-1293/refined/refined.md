Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1293

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the web framework of Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center. These vulnerabilities stem from improper handling of user-supplied input, leading to the potential for cross-site scripting attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79): The web application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and later executed when other users view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center web interface.
- When a user accesses content containing the malicious scripts, these scripts will be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious script into the system.
- The XSS is stored meaning the script is saved in the system and is executed when a victim views the stored content.
- The vulnerability is triggered via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center's web interface.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to inject the malicious script, making the attack easier to carry out.
- The attacker needs the injected script to be viewed by a victim user.
