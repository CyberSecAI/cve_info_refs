  "CVE-2016-1903": {
    "Description": "The gdImageRotateInterpolated function in ext/gd/libgd/gd_interpolation.c in PHP before 5.5.31, 5.6.x before 5.6.14, and 7.x before 7.0.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and application crash) by including the / filename in a .zip PHAR archive.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the bgd_color parameter in the `gdImageRotateInterpolated` function, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the provided color index is larger than the allocated color palette array.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially obtain sensitive information by reading arbitrary memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted image with a specific background color index to a PHP application that uses the `imagerotate` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted image file to a PHP application which uses the `imagerotate` function and control the `bgd_color` parameter."
