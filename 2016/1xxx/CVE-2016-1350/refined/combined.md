"text": "A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gateway implementation in Cisco IOS, IOS XE, and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP messages to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability other than disabling SIP on the vulnerable device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160323-sip[\"https://tvce.cisco.com/security/AIMS/https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160323-sip\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 23, 2016, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes six Cisco Security Advisories that describe six vulnerabilities. All the vulnerabilities have a Security Impact Rating of \"High.\" For a complete list of advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/event-response/cisco-erp-march-2016.html\"].\n"

"text": "SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and\r\nvideo calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP handles all aspects of call setup and termination. Voice and video\r\nare the most popular types of sessions that SIP handles, but the\r\nprotocol has the flexibility to accommodate other applications that\r\nrequire call setup and termination. SIP call signaling can use UDP port\r\n5060, TCP port 5060, or Transport Layer Security (TLS) on TCP port 5061\r\nas the underlying transport protocol."

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS, IOS XE, or Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software that is configured to process SIP messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the \"Fixed Software\" section of this advisory. Recent releases of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software do not process SIP messages by default. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe following Cisco Unified Communications Manager software releases are vulnerable. For information about the earliest Cisco Unified Communications Software release that fixes the vulnerability described in this advisory, see the \"Fixed Software\" section.\n\r\n\r\n Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.x\r\n Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.x\r\n Cisco Unified Communications Manager 10.x\r\n Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.x\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Cisco Unified Communications Manager release 8.x reached\r\nthe End-of-Software-Maintenance milestone on July 26, 2015. Customers using Cisco\r\nUnified Communications Manager 8.x releases should contact their Cisco\r\nsupport team for assistance in upgrading to a supported release of Cisco\r\nUnified Communications Manager.\n\r\n\n\r\nDetermining Whether SIP Is Running\n\r\n\n\r\nCreating a dial peer by issuing the dial-peer configuration command will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco IOS device to process SIP messages. In addition, several features in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, such as ePhones, will also automatically start the SIP process when they are configured, causing the device to start processing SIP messages. An example of an affected Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software configuration follows:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n!\n dial-peer voice pots\n ...\n!\r\nIn addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a dial-peer command that causes the device to process SIP messages, administrators can also use the show processes | include SIP command to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the processes CCSIP\_UDP\_SOCKET or CCSIP\_TCP\_SOCKET indicates that the Cisco IOS device will process SIP messages:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show processes | include SIP  \r\n149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP\_UDP\_SOCKET  \r\n150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP\_TCP\_SOCKET\r\n\n\r\nNote: Because there are several ways that a device running Cisco IOS Software can start processing SIP messages, administrators are advised not to rely on the presence of specific configuration commands. Instead, it is recommended that administrators use the show processes | include SIP command to determine whether the device is processing SIP messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is triggered when a device that is running Cisco IOS, IOS XE, or Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software processes malformed SIP messages. Only traffic destined to the device can trigger the vulnerability; transit SIP traffic is not an exploit vector. This vulnerability can be exploited with SIP over IPv4 or IPv6.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: In cases where SIP is running over TCP transport, a TCP three-way handshake is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software Release\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the command-line interface, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The image name appears in parentheses followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod\_rel\_team\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"].\r\n"

Affected Products  * SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and   video calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP handles all aspects of call setup and termination. Voice and video   are the most popular types of sessions that SIP handles, but the   protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other applications that   require call setup and termination. SIP call signaling can use UDP port   5060, TCP port 5060, or Transport Layer Security (TLS) on TCP port 5061   as the underlying transport protocol.   Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS, IOS XE, or Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software that is configured to process SIP messages.      For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the "Fixed Software" section of this advisory. Recent releases of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software do not process SIP messages by default.       The following Cisco Unified Communications Manager software releases are vulnerable. For information about the earliest Cisco Unified Communications Software release that fixes the vulnerability described in this advisory, see the "Fixed Software" section.   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.x   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.x   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 10.x   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.x   **Note:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager release 8.x reached   the End-of-Software-Maintenance milestone on July 26, 2015. Customers using Cisco   Unified Communications Manager 8.x releases should contact their Cisco   support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported release of Cisco   Unified Communications Manager.      **Determining Whether SIP Is Running**      Creating a dial peer by issuing the **dial-peer** configuration command will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco IOS device to process SIP messages. In addition, several features in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, such as ePhones, will also automatically start the SIP process when they are configured, causing the device to start processing SIP messages. An example of an affected Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software configuration follows:    ```   ! dial-peer voice  pots ...!   ``` In addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a **dial-peer** command that causes the device to process SIP messages, administrators can also use the **show processes | include SIP** command to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the processes CCSIP\_UDP\_SOCKET or CCSIP\_TCP\_SOCKET indicates that the Cisco IOS device will process SIP messages:    ```   Router#show processes | include SIP     149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET     150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET   ```    **Note:** Because there are several ways that a device running Cisco IOS Software can start processing SIP messages, administrators are advised not to rely on the presence of specific configuration commands. Instead, it is recommended that administrators use the **show processes | include SIP** command to determine whether the device is processing SIP messages.      This vulnerability is triggered when a device that is running Cisco IOS, IOS XE, or Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software processes malformed SIP messages. Only traffic destined to the device can trigger the vulnerability; transit SIP traffic is not an exploit vector. This vulnerability can be exploited with SIP over IPv4 or IPv6.      **Note:** In cases where SIP is running over TCP transport, a TCP three-way handshake is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.      **Determining the Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software Release** To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the command-line interface, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to **Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software** or **Cisco IOS Software**. The image name appears in parentheses followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Indicators of Compromise  * To determine whether the vulnerability has been exploited on a device that is running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software, issue the **show memory debug leaks summary** command from the command-line interface.      **Note:** There are no methods to determine whether the vulnerability   has been exploited on Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software.      The following example shows the output of a vulnerable Cisco IOS or IOS XE device where there are observed memory leaks in CCSIP\_UDP\_SOCKET:    ```   Router#show memory debug leaks summaryAdding blocks for GD...

Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability other than disabling SIP on the vulnerable device.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html> Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          **Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software** To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified ("Combined First Fixed").  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.01.4S**-in the following field:                 For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.         **Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software**      | **Cisco UCM Software Major Release** | **First Fixed Release** |   | --- | --- |   | 8.x | Affected; migrate to 9.1(2)su4 or later |   | 9.x | 9.1(2)su4, also referred to as 9.1(2.14900-14) |   | 10.x | 10.5(2)su3, also referred to as 10.5(2.13900-12) |   | 11.x | 11.0(1)su1, also referred to as 11.0(1.21900-11) |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
