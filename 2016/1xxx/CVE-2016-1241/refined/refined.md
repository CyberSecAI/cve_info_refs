Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1241:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the removal of password hashing protection in tryton-server. Specifically, the `password_hash` field did not receive the same hiding treatment as the `password` field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the exposure of password hashes. While strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt and sha1) and random salts are used, the vulnerability allows any user with access to the `password_hash` field to potentially gain access to user passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Password Disclosure: An attacker can potentially obtain password hashes, which might allow them to gain unauthorized access if they can crack the hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct access to the system: An attacker with access to the database where the `password_hash` field is exposed can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the database or the system where the `password_hash` field is exposed.
- Some level of technical expertise to potentially crack the password hashes if they are not easily crackable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as being "difficult to exploit" due to the existing protections (strong hash algorithms, salt), however, the leak still exists and can potentially lead to compromise.
- The issue was introduced in a commit that intended to improve security by using bcrypt for hashing when possible (r[c9be44cd05e1](/tryton/tryton/-/commit/c9be44cd05e123a9b1c957b8d43fd577563ebd8e)).
- The vulnerability affects tryton-server versions <= 3.0.
- Debian has released fixed versions of the package to address this issue.
