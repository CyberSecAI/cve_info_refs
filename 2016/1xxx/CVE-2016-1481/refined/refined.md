- An attacker can cause the device to become unresponsive, disrupting email services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Attackers can send a crafted email with a malformed DGN file attachment.
- The email must trigger one of the vulnerable message filtering rules on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a system utilizing vulnerable versions of Cisco AsyncOS software with message filtering configured using the vulnerable rules.
- No special authentication is required.
- The attacker only needs to send an email to a vulnerable device that matches the filters in place.

**Additional Notes:**
