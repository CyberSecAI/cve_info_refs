# [CERT 777024 / CVE-2016-1524/5]: RCE and file download in Netgear NMS300

Hi,

CERT/CC has helped me disclose two vulnerabilities in NETGEAR's
Pro"safe" Network Management System 300 [1]. Two classical bugs: one
remote code execution via arbitrary file upload and an authenticated
arbitrary file download.

The full advisory can be seen in my repo at [2] and it is also pasted
below. I've also released two Metasploit modules to exploit these
vulnerabilities [3][4].

There is currently no fix for these - do not expose NMS300 to the
Internet! I've decided to release the exploits anyway as CERT's advisory
details how the vulnerability can be exploited.

Regards,
Pedro

```
Netgear's NMS300 is a network management utility that runs on Windows
systems. It has serious two vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a
remote attacker. The first one is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability
that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute Java code as the
SYSTEM user.
The second vulnerability is an arbitrary file download that allows an
authenticated user to download any file from the host that is running
NMS300.

A special thanks to Joel Land of CERT/CC for helping disclose this
vulnerability under ID 777024 [1]. Two new Metasploit modules that
exploit these vulnerabilities have been released.

#1
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via arbitrary file upload
(unauthenticated)
CVE-2016-1525
Affected versions:
NMS300 1.5.0.11
NMS300 1.5.0.2
NMS300 1.4.0.17
NMS300 1.1.0.13

There are two servlets that allow unauthenticated file uploads:
@RequestMapping({ "/fileUpload.do" })
public class FileUpload2Controller
- Uses spring file upload

@RequestMapping({ "/lib-1.0/external/flash/fileUpload.do" })
public class FileUploadController
- Uses flash upload

The JSP file can be uploaded as shown below, it will be named
null[name].[extension] and can be reached on
http://[host]:8080/null[name].[extension].
So for example if [name] = "testing" and [extension] = ".jsp", the final
file will be named "nulltesting.jsp". [name] and [extension] can be seen
in the sample request below. The code will execute as the SYSTEM user.

POST /lib-1.0/external/flash/fileUpload.do HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;

#2
Vulnerability: Arbitrary file download (authenticated)
CVE-2016-1524
Affected versions:
NMS300 1.5.0.11
NMS300 1.5.0.2
NMS300 1.4.0.17
NMS300 1.1.0.13

Three steps need to be taken in order to exploit this vulnerability:
a) Add a configuration image, with the realName parameter containing the
path traversal to the target file:
POST /data/config/image.do?method=add HTTP/1.1
realName=../../../../../../../../../../<file on
C:\>&md5=&fileName=<imagename.img>&version=1337&vendor=Netgear&deviceType=4&deviceModel=FS526Tv2&description=bla

b) Obtain the file identifier (imageId) for the image that was created
by scraping the page below for "imagename.img" (the fileName parameter
in step 1):
POST /data/getPage.do?method=getPageList&type=configImgManager
everyPage=10000

Sample response:
{"page":{"beginIndex":0,"recordCount":7,"totalRecords":7,"currentPage":1,"everyPage":10,"totalPage":1},"list":[{"imageId":"1","fileName":"agga5.img","createTime":"10/03/2015
21:12:36","realFileName":"../../../../../../../../../../log.txt","vendor":"Netgear","deviceType":"4","deviceModel":"FS526Tv2","version":"2323","sizeM":"24491","createBy":"admin","createId":"1","description":"bla\r\n"}

c) Download the file with the imageId obtained in step 2:
GET /data/config/image.do?method=export&imageId=<ID>

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

        Netgear's ProSafe NMS300 is a network management utility that runs on Windows systems.
        The application has a file upload vulnerability that can be exploited by an
        unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code as the SYSTEM user.
        Two servlets are vulnerable, FileUploadController (located at
        /lib-1.0/external/flash/fileUpload.do) and FileUpload2Controller (located at /fileUpload.do).
        This module exploits the latter, and has been tested with versions 1.5.0.2, 1.4.0.17 and
        1.1.0.13.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Netgear Management System NMS300 contains arbitrary file upload and path traversal vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#777024

Original Release Date: 2016-02-03 | Last Revised: 2016-02-04

---

### Overview

Netgear Management System NMS300, version 1.5.0.11 and earlier, is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload, which may be leveraged by unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. A directory traversal vulnerability enables authenticated users to download arbitrary files.

### Description

| [Netgear Management System NMS300](http://downloadcenter.netgear.com/en/product/NMS300) is a configuration, monitoring, and diagnostics utility for managing SNMP networked devices via a web interface.  [**CWE-434**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** - CVE-2016-1524Default installations of NMS300 operate two Java servlets, http://<IP>:8080/fileUpload.do and http://<IP>:8080/lib-1.0/external/flash/fileUpload.do, that can be accessed by unauthenticated users. By sending a specially crafted POST request to the servlets, an attacker can upload arbitrary files that will then be accessible from the NMS300 server's root directory as http://<IP>:8080/null<filename>. The NMS300 server runs with SYSTEM privileges.[**CWE-22**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** - CVE-2016-1525NMS300 contains a directory traversal vulnerability. An authenticated attacker can manipulate the realName parameter of a crafted POST request sent to http://<IP>:8080/data/config/image.do?method=add to load an arbitrary local file from the server host to a predictable location in the web service. The file can then be downloaded from http://<IP>:8080/data/config/image.do?method=export&imageId=<ID>, where <ID> is a count that increments by one every time a file is uploaded in this manner.For more information, refer to [Pedro Ribeiro's disclosure](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Feb/30). The CVSS score describes CVE-2016-1524. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker on the network can upload arbitrary files to the server's root web directory, leading to data creation and arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. An authenticated attacker on the network can access any file on the server host. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem and recommends the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Enable firewall rules to restrict untrusted sources from accessing the web management interface. |

### NETGEAR ProSafe Network Management System 300 Arbitrary File Upload

Disclosed
02/04/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

Netgear's ProSafe NMS300 is a network management utility that runs on Windows systems.
The application has multiple vulnerabilities that can allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute code as SYSTEM user. Vulnerabilities include authentication bypass,
SQL injection, arbitrary file upload, and privilege escalation across various versions.
This module is able to spawn a meterpreter session by chaining together two specific
vulnerabilities inside the FileUploadController and MyHandlerInterceptor classes.
This module has been tested with versions 1.5.0.2, 1.4.0.17, 1.1.0.13, 1.7.0.12, and 1.7.0.1.

* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/windows/http/netgear_nms_rce.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/http/netgear_nms_rce
msf exploit(netgear_nms_rce) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(netgear_nms_rce) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(netgear_nms_rce) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(netgear_nms_rce) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.
