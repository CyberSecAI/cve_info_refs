{
  "CVE-2016-1899": {
    "Description": "CRLF injection vulnerability in the ui-blob handler in CGit before 0.12 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via CRLF sequences in the mimetype parameter, as demonstrated by a request to blob/cgit.c.",
    "Root cause": "The ui-blob handler accepted a mimetype as a query string and echoed this string verbatim back. This allowed an attacker to inject CRLF sequences in the mimetype parameter.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CRLF Injection",
      "HTTP Header Injection",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers, conduct HTTP response splitting attacks, or perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with CRLF sequences in the mimetype query string parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server, no specific capabilities or position needed."
