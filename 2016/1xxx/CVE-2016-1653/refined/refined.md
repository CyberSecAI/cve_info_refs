{
  "CVE-2016-1653": {
    "description": "The LoadBuffer implementation in Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.75, mishandles data types, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that triggers an out-of-bounds write operation, related to compiler/pipeline.cc and compiler/simplified-lowering.cc.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The V8 JavaScript engine's `LoadBuffer` implementation incorrectly handles data types, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to mishandling of data types in the `LoadBuffer` implementation."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.  The vulnerability could lead to incorrect data processing and potentially memory corruption.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker exploits the vulnerability by delivering specially crafted JavaScript code through a website or other means.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft specific JavaScript code that triggers the data type mishandling within `LoadBuffer`. The attacker needs to lure a user to visit the malicious webpage/content."
    },
    "affected_components": [
        "Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine",
        "Chromium Browser's `LoadBuffer` implementation"
    ],
    "patch_information": "The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 50.0.2661.75 and later. The fix involves bailing out of the pipeline when the LoadBuffer type is incorrect, preventing undefined or NaN values from being observed.  The fix also includes updated test cases and removal of outdated tests."
