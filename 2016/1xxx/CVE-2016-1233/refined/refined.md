CVE-2016-1233:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The fuse package ships a udev rule that adjusts permissions on the related /dev/cuse character device, making it world-writable.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: World-writable character device.
  - Impact of exploitation: A local, unprivileged attacker can create an arbitrarily named character device in /dev and modify the memory of any process that opens it and performs an ioctl on it. This can lead to privilege escalation to root.
  - Attack vectors: A local, unprivileged attacker.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access to the system.
