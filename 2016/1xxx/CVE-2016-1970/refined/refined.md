Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-1970, CVE-2016-1971, CVE-2016-1972 and CVE-2016-1973:

**CVE-2016-1970**

*   **Root Cause:** An integer underflow in the `srtp_unprotect` function within the WebRTC implementation.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing bounds checks on the length of the packet header extensions. This allows the calculation of an incorrect decryption length (`enc_octet_len`), leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Impact:**  A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (memory corruption), possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By sending crafted packets over a network.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted packets to a target using the vulnerable WebRTC functionality. 

**CVE-2016-1971**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing status check in the `I420VideoFrame::CreateFrame` function.
*   **Weaknesses:** The function fails to check for allocation errors during plane copy operations. If `Plane::Copy` fails due to an out-of-memory condition, `CreateFrame` proceeds to set the width and height members using invalid memory and doesn't propagate error, resulting in use of incorrect values in rendering causing out-of-bounds read of memory later.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (memory corruption), possibly leading to other unspecified impacts. 
*   **Attack Vectors:** By influencing the allocation size and sending malformed WebRTC packets.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to cause memory allocation failures on the target and send malformed WebRTC packets.

**CVE-2016-1972**

*   **Root Cause**: A race condition in libvpx leading to a use-after-free.
*   **Weaknesses**: The `GetStaticInstance` function is vulnerable to race conditions.
*   **Impact**:  Denial of Service (use-after-free) or possibly arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Unspecified vectors, but it is triggered by interacting with WebRTC.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker needs to trigger a specific sequence of actions that can trigger the race condition and use after free vulnerability

**CVE-2016-1973**

*  **Root Cause**: Race condition in the `GetStaticInstance` function in WebRTC.
*   **Weaknesses:** The function is prone to race condition, leading to use after free.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors by causing use-after-free.
*  **Attack Vectors**: Via WebRTC functionality.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with the ability to interact with vulnerable WebRTC functionality.

**Additional Points:**

*   **SUSE:** SUSE rates these vulnerabilities as "important" and has released patches for them.  They also note that the CVSS scores can vary based on the source of the score (NVD vs SUSE).
*   **Mozilla:** Mozilla has addressed the vulnerabilities in Firefox 45. They provide detailed explanations and patches in their bug tracker.
*   **Upstream Fixes**: Some fixes were incorporated in the upstream libsrtp and WebRTC projects.
*  **Exploitability**: The reports mention that exploitation of these vulnerabilities may be difficult but is not impossible, especially in server scenarios where denial-of-service is a potential risk.
*   **Affected Platforms:** Some vulnerabilities are specific to Windows (CVE-2016-1970, CVE-2016-1971), while others are general (CVE-2016-1972, CVE-2016-1973).
*   **Common Theme:** A common theme across the vulnerabilities is related to memory safety and bounds checking issues in WebRTC and related libraries, which, when triggered, can lead to crashes or potential arbitrary code execution.
