Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a user account with a default and static password. This account is created during installation and cannot be changed or deleted without impacting system functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Default Credentials:** The presence of a hardcoded, static password for a user account that cannot be modified or deleted.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in to the affected device with root user privileges and bash shell access. This grants complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access via Telnet:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by connecting to the affected system remotely via Telnet.
- **Remote Access via SSH (Specific Release):** In Cisco Nexus 3500 Platform Switches running NX-OS Software release 6.0(2)A6(1), the default account can also be used with SSH remote access.
- **Local Access via Serial Console:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally through the serial console.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device to exploit via Telnet or SSH.
- **Physical Access (For Serial Console Exploit):** For exploitation through the serial console, physical access to the device is required.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs knowledge of the default and static credentials of the vulnerable account.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches running specific NX-OS Software releases (6.0(2)U6(1) to 6.0(2)U6(5)) and Cisco Nexus 3500 Platform Switches running specific NX-OS Software releases (6.0(2)A6(1) to 6.0(2)A7(1)).
- **Workaround:** Disabling Telnet and using SSH (except for Nexus 3500 with 6.0(2)A6(1)) as a temporary fix, with no workaround for serial console exploitation.
- **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released free software updates to address this vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** Base score is 10.0 and temporal score is 8.3.
- **CWE:** CWE-287 Improper Authentication
- **Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited with readily available exploit code.
