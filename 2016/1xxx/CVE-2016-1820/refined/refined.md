Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the failure to validate a user-supplied size before copying data into a kernel buffer within the `IOAudioFamily` kernel extension. This lack of validation leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability. Data larger than the allocated buffer can be written, overwriting adjacent memory regions.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly check the size of the user-supplied data before performing a copy operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and execute code within the context of the kernel.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, giving them complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable machine.
- **User Interaction:** The target user must interact with a malicious page or open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. This could involve visiting a webpage with specially crafted content or opening a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable macOS system.
- **Ability to trigger User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce the user to either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apple OS X within the `IOAudioFamily` kernel extension.
- Apple has released an update to address this issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jack Tang and Moony Li of Trend Micro.
