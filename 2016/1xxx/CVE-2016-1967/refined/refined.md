  "CVE-2016-1967": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2016-1967",
      "Description": "Mozilla Firefox before 45.0 does not properly restrict the availability of IFRAME Resource Timing API times, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and obtain sensitive information via crafted JavaScript code that leverages history.back and performance.getEntries calls after restoring a browser session. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7207."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix in Firefox for CVE-2015-7207. When a browser session is restored, the Resource Timing API times for cross-origin IFRAMEs can be improperly exposed through the `performance.getEntries()` method, particularly after using the `history.back()` method.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Same-origin policy bypass",
        "Exposure of sensitive information"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can steal confidential data by bypassing the same-origin policy. Specifically, an attacker can use crafted JavaScript code to access sensitive information from cross-origin iframes after a browser session has been restored.",
      "Attack Vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website, then forcing a history navigation and restoring a previous session.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to craft a malicious website with JavaScript that can exploit the `performance.getEntries()` API in combination with the browser's session restore functionality. The attacker also needs to trick a user into opening the malicious website.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is triggered after a browser session is restored, leveraging the browser cache and history API to bypass same-origin policy restrictions. The attacker uses the performance.getEntries() API after a history navigation using history.back to steal cross-origin URL data."
