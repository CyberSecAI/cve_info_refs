Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure. It stems from a lack of proper input validation or sanitization, leading to a Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS):** The core vulnerability is XFS. This means an attacker can potentially inject malicious scripts into a web page, which will then be executed within the context of the victim's browser. This is similar to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), but instead of injecting scripts directly into the content of a page, the attack involves embedding or loading malicious content within an iframe.
*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** The advisory specifically mentions CWE-20, which indicates a general lack of proper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Potential for Malicious Script Execution:** A successful attack could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the Cisco Prime Infrastructure web interface.
*   **Compromised User Sessions:** This could lead to user session hijacking, where the attacker gains access to the victim's logged-in session and perform actions on their behalf.
*   **Manipulation of Page Content:** An attacker could modify content displayed on the page, potentially deceiving users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can initiate the exploit over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated, Remote:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability; they can attack remotely.
*   **Web Interface:** The exploit targets the web interface of the affected Cisco Prime Infrastructure software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Cisco Prime Infrastructure server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need knowledge of the XFS vulnerability in the web interface.
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload (typically HTML/JavaScript) that will be loaded within a frame on the victim's browser.
*   **Low skill level:** Exploit code is available and functional, so a low-skilled attacker could potentially leverage this.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Product:** Cisco Prime Infrastructure Release 2.2(2) is vulnerable.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) and a temporal score of 4.1 (E:F/RL:U/RC:C).
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available, which emphasizes the need for a software patch.
*   **Fixed Software:** The advisory directs users to Cisco's Bug Search Tool to find information on fixed software versions.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-1474 describes an XFS vulnerability in Cisco Prime Infrastructure's web interface, resulting from a lack of proper input validation. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, page manipulation, and other malicious actions within a user's browser session. There are no workarounds available and users are advised to install the provided patch.
