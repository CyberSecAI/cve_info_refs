Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1866:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of clear (unencrypted) messages by the Salt minion. Salt versions 2015.8.x before 2015.8.4 did not properly validate the source of the messages received by the minion, allowing for the possibility of malicious injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of proper message validation:** The Salt minion did not sufficiently verify the origin of unencrypted messages received on the pub port, trusting messages from any source.
*   **Cleartext Communication:**  The vulnerability is specific to cleartext communication between the Salt minion and master.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious commands into the cleartext communication stream, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the Salt minion, potentially gaining control of the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker with a position on the network between the minion and master could intercept and modify the data stream, injecting commands.
*   **TCP connection hijacking:** The attacker needs to successfully attack an existing TCP connection between the Salt minion and master on the pub port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the network path between a Salt master and minion.
*   **Ability to intercept and inject TCP packets:** The attacker needs the capability to perform a MitM attack and inject packets into the established TCP connection between the Salt minion and master.
*   **No need for master credentials:** The attacker does not need to compromise the master or obtain its credentials. The vulnerability lies in the minion's acceptance of unauthenticated commands over cleartext communication.
*   **No decryption of encrypted traffic:** The exploit does not involve decrypting encrypted traffic or obtaining the shared secret between the minion and master.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is limited to Salt versions 2015.8.x before 2015.8.4.
*   This vulnerability has been fixed in Salt versions 2015.8.4 and later (2015.8.5 has a regression fix)
*   The vulnerability was fixed in openSUSE Leap 42.1 by updating to salt 2015.8.7

The provided information suggests that this vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with a man-in-the-middle position on the network, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable Salt minion.
