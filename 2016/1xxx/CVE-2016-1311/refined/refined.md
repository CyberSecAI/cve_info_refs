Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1311

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the HTTP web-based management interface of the Cisco Jabber Guest application. Specifically, it stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script into the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS (CWE-79). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
   - Stealing cookies or session tokens
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Defacing the web interface
   - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
   - Potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing administrative tasks depending on the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via a network request to the vulnerable HTTP web-based management interface.
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload, which is then executed when a user accesses the vulnerable interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable web interface. This can be done via a network connection to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, meaning this can be done over the internet.
- The attacker relies on the victim opening the malicious URL and the malicious javascript running in their browser to carry out the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The affected product is Cisco Jabber Guest Server version 10.6(8).
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has acknowledged the vulnerability and assigned it a CVSS base score of 4.3 and a temporal score of 4.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Tom Donaldson.
