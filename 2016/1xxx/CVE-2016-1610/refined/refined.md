```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The email template upload functionality in Micro Focus Filr does not properly restrict the destination directory for uploaded files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication Bypass: An unauthenticated attacker can upload email templates.",
    "Path Traversal: The application does not validate the path of uploaded email templates, allowing writing to arbitrary locations.",
     "Insecure File Permissions: A file executed upon system user login is world-writeable, which allows injection of arbitrary commands. (CVE-2016-1611 - which is used in conjunction)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the server with the privileges of the 'wwwrun' user. Combining this with insecure file permissions can result in arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can upload an email template with a path traversal payload through the web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the Micro Focus Filr instance."
