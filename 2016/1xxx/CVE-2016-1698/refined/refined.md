Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1698:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `createCustomType` function within `extensions/renderer/resources/binding.js` in the extension bindings of Google Chrome.
*   This function doesn't properly validate module types when creating an array of extension views.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Leak:** Improper validation of module types allows attackers to load arbitrary modules or obtain sensitive information by poisoning a definition.
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The `createCustomType` function does not validate the provided module type, leading to the possibility of loading a malicious module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data by injecting malicious modules, potentially including data used by other extensions or browser internals
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Although not directly mentioned, the ability to load arbitrary modules could be leveraged to achieve code execution.
*   **Cross-Origin bypass:** The exploitation could be leveraged to bypass same-origin policy and gain unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted extension:** A malicious or compromised extension could be used to exploit this flaw through a poisoned definition.
*   **Web page:**  A crafted web page that can influence the extension system could potentially trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the modules loaded by the extension system or the data provided to `createCustomType` function, which could happen by having access to malicious extensions or compromised web pages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Rob Wu.
*   The issue was fixed in Chrome version 51.0.2704.79.
*   The vulnerability is described as an information leak with a medium severity according to googlechromereleases.blogspot.com
*   SUSE and RedHat also reported this vulnerability as part of their security advisories.
*   The vulnerability was fixed with a patch that prevents module system from loading arbitrary modules.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-1698 is an information leak vulnerability in Google Chrome's extension bindings due to insufficient validation of module types when creating extension views. This flaw can be exploited by attackers using a malicious or compromised extension or web page to load arbitrary modules or potentially obtain sensitive information.
