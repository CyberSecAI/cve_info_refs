Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue in FileMaker Server where PHP source code can be exposed. This occurs when the "Custom Web Publishing with PHP" feature is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The JVN iPedia entry explicitly mentions this as the related CWE. This suggests the server is not correctly handling or validating requests when processing PHP files, leading to the source code being exposed rather than the interpreted output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive PHP source code. This code could contain proprietary logic, database credentials, API keys, or other confidential information that could be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   The specific method of accessing the PHP source is not directly described, but the "Custom Web Publishing with PHP enabled" part, suggests it is via web requests to the server hosting the custom php code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** An attacker does not need prior access to the system.
*   **User Interaction Required (UI:R) - CVSS v3:** The user interaction in this context likely refers to some specific user interaction required to trigger the vulnerability, which is not described in more detail, but also highlights that it might not be trivial.
*   **High Attack Complexity (AC:H):** Exploiting the vulnerability is considered to be complex. This might involve specific timing, request manipulation, or knowledge of the server's specific setup.

**Summary of Analysis:**

The vulnerability in FileMaker Server allows for the viewing of PHP source code when Custom Web Publishing with PHP is enabled. This is due to improper input validation, which can lead to exposure of sensitive data. While the CVSS score is low, the exposed source code can lead to more severe attacks. The exploitation is over the network, without needing prior access, but it does require some level of attacker complexity and some type of user interaction.
