Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1904:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   The content directly references CVE-2016-1904 and clearly describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `escapeshellarg` and `escapeshellcmd` functions within PHP. The provided text includes a bug report, a patch, and discussions related to this specific vulnerability. Therefore, it is relevant.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

   The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of memory allocation size for escaping shell arguments/commands within the functions `escapeshellarg` and `escapeshellcmd`. The functions use the `strlen` of the input string to estimate the size required for the escaped string, multiplies the length with a constant(4 or 2) and adds a small constant(2 or 3) before allocating memory using `zend_string_alloc`. However when a string with a very large length (e.g. 1024MB) is provided as input to these functions, the size calculation `4 * l + 2` or `2*l` results in an integer overflow leading to a very small amount of memory being allocated. The subsequent copying of the large string into this undersized buffer leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

   - Integer Overflow:  The functions fail to properly handle large input string lengths, causing an integer overflow during memory allocation size calculation.
   - Heap-based buffer overflow:  Due to the integer overflow and the resulting insufficient buffer allocation, the functions write past allocated memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.
   - Inadequate input validation:  The functions lack input length validation, allowing an attacker to trigger the overflow by supplying large strings.
  
**4. Impact of exploitation:**

   - Code injection/execution: By controlling the overwritten memory, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
   - Denial of service (DoS): Repeated triggering of this vulnerability could exhaust server resources or lead to a crash. Although, it was also mentioned by the reporter that DOS may be difficult due to php's max execution time limits.
   - Data corruption: A successful exploit might lead to the corruption of other data in memory.

**5. Attack vectors:**

   -  The attack vector is through user-controlled input to `escapeshellarg()` or `escapeshellcmd()`.  An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a very long string (e.g. >1024 MB) to a PHP script that uses these functions.
   -  Specifically mentioned that HTTP POST parameter are also vulnerable to this attack vector as long as memory\_limit is sufficiently large.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - An attacker needs the ability to provide input to a vulnerable PHP script. This could be through web request parameters, command-line arguments, or any other means by which user-supplied data reaches the functions.
   - The attacker needs to be able to cause the function to allocate at least the integer-overflow causing length and also needs a memory\_limit greater than default (e.g. 128MB) to actually trigger the buffer overflow.

**7. Additional details beyond the official CVE description:**

   - The provided content from openwall.com details that the vulnerability can be triggered when memory\_limit is configured to be greater than around 1024MB, and that the default memory limit of 128MB prevents this vulnerability from being exploitable by default. 
   - It provides the overflow formula: `4 * l + 2` (for `escapeshellarg`) and `2*l` (`escapeshellcmd`)
   - The content also demonstrates how the buffer overflow can be verified using `gdb` debugger by inspecting the allocated `zend_string` structure and showing that the length of the buffer is small and the content gets written past it's boundary.
   - The content suggests that even though the vulnerability has been patched to prevent the buffer overflow, a large string can still cause a DOS on the server due to the long processing time, hence it would be recommended to also implement a check to limit string length.
   - The fix uses `zend_string_safe_alloc` to prevent the integer overflow from occurring.
   - It provides a complete code path of how integer overflow occurs with `strlen`, `zend_string_alloc`, and the subsequent overflow during the buffer writing.
   - It mentions that the patch has been applied to PHP 7.0.2, and further work will be done to address other problems.
   - It notes that the vulnerability for php\_escape\_shell\_cmd is identical.
