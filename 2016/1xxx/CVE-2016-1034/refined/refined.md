Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in a service exposed by the Adobe Creative Cloud application. This service listens on a random TCP port and allows remote users to execute various API methods. This is further specified to be due to a vulnerability in the Javascript API for Creative Cloud Libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Authentication:** The exposed service does not require authentication, allowing any remote user to interact with it.
*   **Unrestricted API Access:**  The vulnerable service provides unrestricted access to its API, enabling attackers to call various methods.
*   **Remote File Read/Write**: The vulnerability in the Javascript API for Creative Cloud Libraries allows for the ability to remotely read and write files on the client's file system

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage the lack of authentication and unrestricted API access to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, under the context of the current user.
*  **Remote File Access**: An attacker can read and write arbitrary files on the client's file system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:**  The vulnerability is network-based, as the service listens on a TCP port, and the attack can be initiated remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable service on the victim's machine via the network. They do not need to be on the same network, as the service is listening on a TCP port, which can be accessed over the internet.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability due to the lack of authentication in the exposed service.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability affects Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application versions 3.5.1.209 and earlier.
* Adobe recommends users update to Creative Cloud 3.6.0.244 to remediate the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is present on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
