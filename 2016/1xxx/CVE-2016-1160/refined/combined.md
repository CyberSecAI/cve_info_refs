This is the only plugin of its kind that works well and actively maintained. Works right out of the box. A good plug is the PHP code to insert into your custom template beside using widget to display list of users favs.
I‚Äôd suggest to add more useful features like a setting to enable favorite link for certain post types and also allowing users to rank or organize their fav links ‚Äì such as the most important link at top.
Thank you.

Well, it‚Äôs time to say goodbye to one of my favourite plugins as it no longer works on the latest WP release. It completely broke the javascript across this site, so I‚Äôll have to be looking for a replacement. üôÅ
