## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/05/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, May 11, 2016

The stable channel has been updated to 50.0.2661.102 for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [5 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-3-M50+type%3Dbug-security&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/50.0.2661.94..50.0.2661.102?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

## Details

An out of bounds write was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1660](/security/CVE-2016-1660))

It was discovered that Blink assumes that a frame which passes same-origin

checks is local in some cases. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-1661](/security/CVE-2016-1661))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1663](/security/CVE-2016-1663))

It was discovered that the JSGenericLowering class in V8 mishandles

comparison operators. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-1665](/security/CVE-2016-1665))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-1666](/security/CVE-2016-1666))

It was discovered that the TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded function in Blink

does not prevent script execution during node-adoption operations. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1667](/security/CVE-2016-1667))

It was discovered that the forEachForBinding in the V8 bindings in Blink

uses an improper creation context. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1668](/security/CVE-2016-1668))

A buffer overflow was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-1669](/security/CVE-2016-1669))

A race condition was discovered in ResourceDispatcherHostImpl in Chromium.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to make arbitrary HTTP

requests. ([CVE-2016-1670](/security/CVE-2016-1670))

Here's the entire function from 3.14.5.10:    // Creates a new segment, sets it size, and pushes it to the front   // of the segment chain. Returns the new segment.   Segment* Zone::NewSegment(int size) {     Segment* result = reinterpret_cast<Segment*>(Malloced::New(size));     adjust_segment_bytes_allocated(size);     if (result != NULL) {       result->Initialize(segment_head_, size);       segment_head_ = result;     }     return result;   }  Here's what Malloced::New(size) does (from allocation.cc):    void* Malloced::New(size_t size) {     void* result = malloc(size);     ...  5) In later versions of v8, they tried to be efficient with calls to glibc malloc/free and got things wrong, exposing the issue:    // Compute the new segment size. We use a 'high water mark'   // strategy, where we increase the segment size every time we expand   // except that we employ a maximum segment size when we delete. This   // is to avoid excessive malloc() and free() overhead.  These later versions of v8 are not shipped in RHEL OSP 7-10, so I don't think this product is affected.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1335449#c19)  Lon Hohberger    2017-03-13 19:18:52 UTC  ``` That is, the overflow in NewExpand() would be because we tried to expand past the bounds of the previously-allocated block on v5.  In v3.14.5.10, we always call malloc(), so this issue doesn't occur.  Since there's no Zone::New() in v3.14.5.10, this function also can't be affected.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1335449#c20)  Lon Hohberger    2017-03-13 19:23:35 UTC  ``` Whoops, wrong function :)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1335449#c21)  Lon Hohberger    2017-03-13 19:29:14 UTC  ``` So, ignore point (3) (wrong function) and (5) (NewExpand does try to preserve some memory).  Points (1) and (2) are still valid. There is no Zone::New() in v8 3.14.5.10  The patch that is added to NewExpand() adds a DCHECK() line which does not do anything on production builds (only debug builds).   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1335449#c22)  Lon Hohberger    2017-03-13 19:37:38 UTC  ``` Nope, theory disproved:  [root@localhost ~]# d8 V8 version 3.14.5.10 [console: readline] d8> var r2 = new RegExp("(?=)*", "g"); d8> var s0 = s0 = Array(220000700).join('a'); d8> result = s0.match(r2) [  301.477942] d8[2486]: segfault at 7f3f71ad7000 ip 00007f3f7f4f3ceb sp 00007ffecb537d98 error 7 in libc-2.17.so[7f3f7f465000+1b6000] Segmentation fault (core dumped)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1335449#c23)  Lon Hohberger    2017-03-13 19:42:45 UTC  ``` The backtrace is completely different, but it's still falling apart.

It is used to validate that a request id from the renderer is unique and doesn't overwrite pending_loaders_ or delegate_map_ entries. It's not so nice that information is duplicated. The set of request ids in use can also be obtained from pending_loaders_ and blocked_loaders_map_, but the latter would have to be iterated. Another option would probably be to generate request ids on browser side.

I generally feel that every fix should come with a test.  I'm less sure about issues like this, but then, perhaps it should be considered more important to have tests because it's considered a security issue. ```     | **mmenke** | | On 2016/01/20 15:38:23, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/01/20 05:51:01, gzobqq wrote: > > On 2016/01/19 ... | | --- | | 4 years, 11 months ago (2016-01-20 15:41:44 UTC) [#9](#msg9) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/01/20 15:38:23, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/01/20 05:51:01, gzobqq wrote: > > On 2016/01/19 20:30:31, mmenke wrote: > > > > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc) > > > File content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc (right): > > >  > > > > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc#newcode1177) > > > content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc:1177: void > > > ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::UpdateRequestForTransfer( > > > BUG:  This changes the id of a request, so needs to update the set as well.  > > I'm > > > not a huge fan of the information duplicating approach because it inevitably > > > leads to bug like this.

Sorry for slowness.  content/browser/security_exploit_browsertest.cc looks to be the place you want to add a test.  See InvalidOriginHeaders, in particular.  I think it's safe to use IpcSecurityTestUtil::PwnMessageReceived for both the initial request, and the followup with the duplicate id.  Ideally we'd have a test where the initial request is in the BlockedLoadersList, and a test where it's in the pending list.  For a URL to request, to avoid any chance the request will actually complete, I think it's best to use   net::URLRequestFailedJob::GetMockHttpUrlWithFailurePhase(net::URLRequestFailedJob::START, net::ERR_IO_PENDING) as the URL.  To use the mocks, you'll need to add code in the test fixture's SetUpOnMainThread() method to post a task to the IOThread to call net::URLRequestFailedJob::AddUrlHandler();  Happy to talk more about the details of setting up the test. ```     | **gzobqq** | | On 2016/01/25 20:08:31, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/01/21 17:34:33, gzobqq wrote: > > On 2016/01/21 ... | | --- | | 4 years, 11 months ago (2016-01-26 10:07:46 UTC) [#14](#msg14) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/01/25 20:08:31, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/01/21 17:34:33, gzobqq wrote: > > On 2016/01/21 16:32:34, mmenke wrote: > > > On 2016/01/20 18:57:48, gzobqq wrote: > > > > On 2016/01/20 15:41:44, mmenke wrote: > > > > > On 2016/01/20 15:38:23, mmenke wrote: > > > > > > On 2016/01/20 05:51:01, gzobqq wrote: > > > > > > > On 2016/01/19 20:30:31, mmenke wrote: > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc) > > > > > > > > File content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc > > (right): > > > > > > > >  > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1608573002/diff/20001/content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc#newcode1177) > > > > > > > > content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc:1177: void > > > > > > > > ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::UpdateRequestForTransfer( > > > > > > > > BUG:  This changes the id of a request, so needs to update the set > > as > > > > > well.  > > > > > > > I'm > > > > > > > > not a huge fan of the information duplicating approach because it > > > > > inevitably > > > > > > > > leads to bug like this.

To reduce round-trips, suggest you add an owner for the security tests (tsepez or creis) once you've responded to comments.  Since creis owns bad_messages as well, suggest you go with him.  You also need a histograms.xml owner - anyone in the histograms owners file should be fine.
