# CVE-2016-1555 - Notification

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

NETGEAR is aware of the security issue that allows unauthenticated web pages to pass form input directly to the command-line interface. A remote attacker can potentially inject arbitrary commands which are then executed by the system.

This is a software vulnerability that affects only certain NETGEAR devices:

* WN604 Wireless N-150 Access Point
* WN802Tv2 Wireless-N Access Point
* WNAP210v2 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point
* WNAP320 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point
* WNDAP350 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point
* WNDAP360 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point
* WNDAP660 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point

NETGEAR strongly recommends updating the firmware on your device with the latest version to prevent the issue.

You can download the latest firmware version using the following links:

| Access Point Model: | Firmware: | Link: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WN604 Wireless N-150 Access Point | v3.3.3 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WN604](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WN604) |
| WNAP210v2 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNAP210v2](http://support.netgear.com/product/WNAP210v2) |
| WNAP320 ProSAFE Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNAP320](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WNAP320) |
| WNDAP350 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNAP350](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WNDAP350) |
| WNDAP360 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNDAP360](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WNDAP360) |
| WNDAP660 ProSAFE Dual Band Wireless-N Access Point | v3.5.5.0 or later | [support.netgear.com/product/WNDAP660](http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WNDAP660) |

The versions listed in the table address the vulnerability issues and contain measures to prevent command line injection. Using command line injection, an attacker is allowed to run commands on the device without knowing the username and password. The potential for command line injection remains if operating a version lower than those listed on the table and not updating the firmware. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by upgrading the firmware as stated in this notification.

# D-Link, Netgear Router Vulnerabiltiies

---

*From*: Dominic Chen <ddchen () andrew cmu edu>

```
Hello,

We’d like to report several vulnerabilities in embedded devices developed by D-Link and Netgear, which were discovered
using our FIRMADYNE framework for emulation and dynamic analysis of Linux-based embedded devices. For more information,
refer to our academic paper and open-source release at <https://github.com/firmadyne/firmadyne>.

Several Netgear devices include unauthenticated webpages that pass form input directly to the command-line, allowing
for a command injection attack in `boardData102.php`, `boardData103.php`, `boardDataJP.php`, `boardDataNA.php`, and
`boardDataWW.php`. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1555. Affected devices include:

Netgear WN604
Netgear WN802Tv2
Netgear WNAP210
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

Several D-Link devices include a web server that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow while parsing the 'dlink_uid'
cookie. The length of the value set in the cookie is obtained using strlen(), which is then passed to memcpy(), and the
value is copied into a fixed-size buffer. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1558. Affected devices include:

D-Link DAP-2310
D-Link DAP-2330
D-Link DAP-2360
D-Link DAP-2553
D-Link DAP-2660
D-Link DAP-2690
D-Link DAP-2695

Several Netgear devices include unauthenticated webpages that disclose the wireless WPS PIN, allowing for information
disclosure. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1556. Affected devices include:

Netgear WN604
Netgear WNAP210
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WND930
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

Several devices by both D-Link and Netgear disclose wireless passwords and administrative usernames/passwords over
SNMP, including OID’s iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4,
iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.4.1.1.1, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.37.4.1.1.1, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.4.1.1.1,
iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.8.1.5, iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.5, iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.7, and
iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.10.1.7. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1557 for Netgear devices, and CVE-2016-1559 for D-Link
devices. Affected devices include:

D-Link DAP-1353
D-Link DAP-2553
D-Link DAP-3520
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

We have not heard back from D-Link after contacting the vendor. Netgear will fix WN604 with firmware 3.3.3 by late
February, but the tentative ETA for the remaining devices is mid-March.

Thanks,

Dominic

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
