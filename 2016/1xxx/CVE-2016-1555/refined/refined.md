Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-1555:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unauthenticated web pages on certain Netgear devices that directly pass user-supplied form input to the command-line interface. Specifically, the vulnerable pages are `boardData102.php`, `boardData103.php`, `boardDataJP.php`, `boardDataNA.php`, and `boardDataWW.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw.  The lack of sanitization of user inputs before passing to the command-line interface allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could potentially lead to a complete takeover of the device, data exfiltration, denial of service, or further attacks on the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication, making it easily exploitable by remote attackers.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP using specially crafted POST requests to the vulnerable PHP pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface. There are no requirements to be on the local network.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Pages:**  The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable PHP pages on the device.

**Affected Devices:**

*   Netgear WN604
*   Netgear WN802Tv2
*  Netgear WNAP210v2
*   Netgear WNAP320
*   Netgear WNDAP350
*   Netgear WNDAP360
*   Netgear WNDAP660

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db content provides a Metasploit module that can be used to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability.
*   The seclists.org content provides the initial report of the vulnerability including the vulnerable files, impacted devices, and the CVE identifier. It also provides information regarding other vulnerabilities found in both D-Link and Netgear routers at the time.
*   Netgear released firmware updates to address this issue and strongly recommends users update their devices.
*   The vendor advisory suggests that this vulnerability allows command execution without needing the username and password for the affected devices.
