Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The 105 BANK App fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate SSL Certificate Verification:** The app does not perform sufficient checks on the SSL/TLS certificates presented by the server during encrypted communication. This includes improper or missing validation of the certificate chain of trust and potentially the hostname verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept and eavesdrop on the encrypted communication between the app and the bank's server. This can lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality breach:** The attacker can steal sensitive information being transmitted, such as login credentials, account details, and transaction data.
    *   **Integrity Compromise:** The attacker can potentially modify the data in transit, leading to unauthorized actions on the user's account (e.g., transferring money to a different account).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker must be positioned on the network path between the app and the server. This can be achieved by:
    *   Setting up a malicious wireless access point (rogue AP).
    *   Compromising network infrastructure (routers, switches).
    *   Being on the same network as the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the network communication between the app and the server.
*   **MITM Capability:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability is triggered without requiring any specific actions from the user, once a connection is established.
* **High Attack Complexity:** Exploitation requires precise timing and network manipulation
