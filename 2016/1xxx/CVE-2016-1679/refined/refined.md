Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ToV8Value` function in `content/child/v8_value_converter_impl.cc`, specifically within the V8 bindings of the Chromium browser.
*   The function does not properly restrict the use of getters and setters when converting values to V8 (the JavaScript engine used by Chrome).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free condition. This occurs because the improper handling of getters and setters can lead to an attempt to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a browser crash due to accessing invalid memory, causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** The use-after-free vulnerability could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This would likely require further exploitation techniques (e.g., controlling the freed memory contents).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Pages:** A malicious web page can be crafted to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **JavaScript:** The attack is launched through specially crafted JavaScript code that can trigger the improper conversion.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is delivered remotely through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote, and no authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The victim must be tricked into opening a malicious website for the exploit to be triggered.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the way the `ToV8Value` function interacts with getters and setters during value conversion.
*   The issue is specific to Chromium's V8 bindings.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by updating Chromium to version 51.0.2704.63.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Several sources (Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Gentoo, and Chromium) all confirm that this issue was resolved by updating to Chromium version 51.0.2704.63.
*   The vulnerability is rated as 'Important' by multiple sources.
*   The vulnerability was awarded a security bounty of $3500 by Google.
*   This CVE is often grouped with other Chromium vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-1672, CVE-2016-1673, etc.) addressed in the same security update.
