Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory corruption issue occurs when a local file, currently being read by the `FileReader` API in Firefox, is modified simultaneously by the user or another program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Memory Corruption:**  Modifying a file while it's being read by FileReader leads to a memory corruption, specifically, a write to a non allocated buffer. This is due to improper handling of file access during concurrent read and write operations using FileReader.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered due to the race condition between the file reading operation and the external modification of the same file, which creates a conflict in memory access by FileReader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the Firefox application.
- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The crash can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** The vulnerability requires the use of a local file as input to the `FileReader` API.
- **Concurrent Modification:** An attacker needs to arrange for the file to be modified externally (by the user or another program) while FileReader is actively reading it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local File Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make a local file accessible to the browser through the file input functionality.
- **Timing Control:** Although not strictly timing-based in a traditional sense, the attacker needs to orchestrate a scenario where a read operation is ongoing when an external file modification occurs.
- **User Interaction (Likely):** It is likely to require some form of user interaction (e.g. using a file input) to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The crash is related to the processing of file data in the `FILE_AS_BINARY` case by FileReader, with a check being missed, which led to the buffer overflow.
- The crash signature often involves `0x2d2d2d2d` as a fill pattern, suggesting that a write operation goes out of bounds.
- This issue was reported to affect Firefox versions prior to v45.

**Mitigation**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 45 and later versions
- Ubuntu and OpenSuse also provided patches to address this issue.
