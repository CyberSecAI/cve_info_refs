# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2016-26

## Memory corruption when modifying a file being read by FileReader

Announced
March 8, 2016
Reporter
Oriol
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 45

### Description

Security researcher **Oriol** reported memory corruption when local files
are modified (by either the user or another program) at the same time being read using the
`FileReader` API. This flaw requires that input be taken from a local file in
order to be triggered and cannot be triggered by web content. This results in a
potentially exploitable crash when triggered.

## Details

Francis Gabriel discovered a buffer overflow during ASN.1 decoding in NSS.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-1950](/security/CVE-2016-1950))

Bob Clary, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Daniel

Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Randell Jesup, Carsten Book, Gian-Carlo Pascutto,

Tyson Smith, Andrea Marchesini, and Jukka Jylänki discovered multiple

memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-1952](/security/CVE-2016-1952),

[CVE-2016-1953](/security/CVE-2016-1953))

Nicolas Golubovic discovered that CSP violation reports can be used to

overwrite local files. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website with addon signing disabled and unpacked addons installed,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0
Build ID: 20160110030214
Steps to reproduce:
1. Make sure devtools.chrome.enabled is enabled and e10s is disabled
2. Open the browser console
3. Enter the following code
var encoder = new TextEncoder(),
text1 = encoder.encode("hello world"),
text2 = encoder.encode("hello world-----------------------------"),
fileName = OS.Constants.Path.tmpDir + "\\---bug-crash-test-file.txt";
OS.File.writeAtomic(fileName, text1, {tmpPath: fileName + ".tmp"}).then(function() {
var browser = gBrowser.getBrowserForTab(gBrowser.addTab());
browser.addEventListener("load", function() {
var doc = browser.contentDocument;
doc.body.innerHTML = '<input type="file" />';
var file = doc.querySelector('input');
file.value = fileName;
function readFile(callback) {
var fr = new FileReader();
fr.onload = function() {
var data = fr.result;
var array = new Int8Array(data);
if(callback) callback();
};
fr.readAsArrayBuffer(file.files[0]);
}
readFile(function() {
OS.File.writeAtomic(fileName, text2, {tmpPath: fileName + ".tmp"}).then(function() {
readFile();
});
});
}, true);
});
Actual results:
Sometimes Firefox crashes instantly.
Sometimes you must wait a bit (like 10 seconds).
Sometimes you must enter that code multiple times (like 5 times).
But eventually it always crashes.
Expected results:
Firefox shouldn't crash.
Note I used the privileged console in order to set the value of the input automatically. But the crash also happens when selecting the file manually in non-privileged pages.

Unfortunately, I tried the mozregression tool later, it gets a bigger range (e.g. 41.0a1) and sometimes crash without crash reporter. And, I can reproduce this problem in Fx44b7 if run repeatedly now.

I made the crash script from code of <http://stackoverflow.com/q/32215538>
The poster of that question said he ran into lots of crashes. That dates August 2015, so the issue precedes Firefox 44.
And I can reproduce the crash on 43 and 44

I could reproduce a crash with 2013-01-14 nightly. I'm starting to think this bug exists since the implementation of FileReader.
But it's hard to test those too old builds because they don't have a browser console, and the manual steps (descrived in [bug 1198095 comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1198095#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - FileReader APIs return incorrect data when the file read has been updated")) are tedious and seem to have a smaller likelihood to crash, so you must repeat them several times.

The manual steps are the same as [bug 1198095 comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1198095#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - FileReader APIs return incorrect data when the file read has been updated"). Basically,
1. Create a file with some content, e.g. hello world
2. Go to <https://jsfiddle.net/Lv5y9m2u/4/>
3. Click the file input and choose the file created at step 1
4. Change the contents of the file, e.g. to hello world-----------------------------
Probably you will have to repeat a few times.Flags: needinfo?(oriol-bugzilla)

By the way, the crash is also reproducible on Linux, but use / instead of \\ in the file path:
fileName = OS.Constants.Path.tmpDir + "/---bug-crash-test-file.txt";

> Slightly different crash signatures but several in graphics.
The crash does not happen immediately, so I think it's a GC related crash, and that's why each signature is different. That several were in graphics was just by chance. I don't think this bug is related to graphics.

I have found a way to reproduce the problem on old builds which don't have the browser console:
1. Open a new tab
2. Open the web console (it will be privileged because it's in a new tab)
3. Enter this code:
var gBrowser = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1"]
.getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator)
.getMostRecentWindow("navigator:browser").gBrowser;
var OS = Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/osfile.jsm", {}).OS;
4. Enter code from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1238440#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox crashes when modifying a file read by FileReader through file input")
5. Repeat until it crashes
Strangely, the code seems to work if I enter it in the error console, but there it doesn't crash.
Using these steps I can reproduce the crash on 2012-10-04 nightly.
I couldn't test previous builds because OS.File.writeAtomic doesn't work.

OK, I rebuilt my script in order to make it work on old Firefox.
1. Open new tab
2. Open web console
3. Enter this code
Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/NetUtil.jsm");
Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/FileUtils.jsm");
var gBrowser = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1"]
.getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator)
.getMostRecentWindow("navigator:browser").gBrowser,
file = FileUtils.getFile("TmpD", ["---bug-crash-test-file.txt"]),
converter = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/intl/scriptableunicodeconverter"]
.createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter);
converter.charset = "UTF-8";
function writeFile(text, callback) {
var ostream = FileUtils.openSafeFileOutputStream(file);
var istream = converter.convertToInputStream(text);
NetUtil.asyncCopy(istream, ostream, function(status) {
if (!Components.isSuccessCode(status)) throw 'fail';
callback();
});
}
writeFile("hello world", function() {
var browser = gBrowser.getBrowserForTab(gBrowser.addTab());
browser.addEventListener("load", function() {
var doc = browser.contentDocument;
doc.body.innerHTML = '<input type="file" />';
var input = doc.querySelector('input');
input.value = file.path;
function readFile(callback) {
var fr = new FileReader();
fr.onload = function() {
var data = fr.result;
var array = new Int8Array(data);
if(callback) callback();
};
fr.readAsArrayBuffer(input.files[0]);
}
readFile(function() {
writeFile("hello world-----------------------------", readFile);
});
}, true);
});
4. Repeat until crash
With this I could crash 2012-09-01 Nightly, and 2012-08-31 didn't crash even after lots of tries.
Then, the pushlog is <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=fcc533f691e9&tochange=a21fd4d085ad>
In that pushlog there is [bug 786196](/show_bug.cgi?id=786196 "RESOLVED FIXED - [OS.File] Implement flushing"), which is related to files. It might be the culprit.

Flagging :Luqman to check if the patch in [bug 786196](/show_bug.cgi?id=786196 "RESOLVED FIXED - [OS.File] Implement flushing") could have caused this issue. Based on the range above this goes back to Firefox 18 so I don't think it needs to be tracked.

I'm not much convinced it was that bug, but I don't know enough to make a better guess.

Most likely unrelated to [bug 786196](/show_bug.cgi?id=786196 "RESOLVED FIXED - [OS.File] Implement flushing"), as that code isn't triggered during the execution of the sample. Actually, I'm almost sure that this code is not triggered at all in vanilla Firefox.
If it's memory access, it might be related to [bug 785167](/show_bug.cgi?id=785167 "RESOLVED FIXED - ctypes gives out relocatable pointers to ArrayBuffer data"), [bug 720949](/show_bug.cgi?id=720949 "RESOLVED FIXED - Need API for \"transferring\" ArrayBuffer data between runtimes (via shared memory)"), [bug 786903](/show_bug.cgi?id=786903 "RESOLVED FIXED - new TypedArray(otherTypedArray) is way slower than it should be") – I think that this piece of code is executed by all the samples.
Of course, this could be an older issue with OS.File or FileReader that was triggered by any of the patches in the changeset :/

Any chance that this could be reproduced on an Asan or Valgrind build? If this is a memory error, this is probably the best way to corner it.

As mentioned above, I don't think that the patch from [bug 786196](/show_bug.cgi?id=786196 "RESOLVED FIXED - [OS.File] Implement flushing") is the cause. At least not directly since it only defines |File.prototype.flush| and doesn't actually use it anywhere outside of the attached test case.Flags: needinfo?(me+bugzilla)

My test covers FILE\_AS\_BINARY because all the others are already covered by [bug 1198095](/show_bug.cgi?id=1198095 "RESOLVED FIXED - FileReader APIs return incorrect data when the file read has been updated").
> Is this class exposed to content somehow, so a regular webpage could trigger
> this overflow?
Well, the user can do these steps manually editing a file that has been already used as Blob and then, the same blob used as input for a FileReader.

crash3.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
I don't know, but for sure we are writing things in a non allocated buffer and the input is taken from a local file.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Absolutely, and a test is included.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Easy to backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
No regressions here.

What uses 0x2d2d2d2d as a fill pattern? most of the stacks in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1238440#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox crashes when modifying a file read by FileReader through file input") and [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1238440#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox crashes when modifying a file read by FileReader through file input") show that.
It looks like memory corruption, but this functionality is limited to chrome code and it only happens if the user (or some other process) is changing the file locally so this couldn't be used in a remote exploit (at least not without a second, worse, "run code as chrome" bug). I'll call this sec-moderateFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, and the Network Security Service (NSS) is a
library implementing security features like SSL v.2/v.3, TLS, PKCS #5,
PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME and X.509 certificates. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as
‘Mozilla Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, NSS, NSPR, and
Thunderbird. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.22.2"

```

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-38.7.0"

```

All users of the Thunderbird binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-38.7.0"

```

All Firefox 38.7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-38.7.0"

```

All users of the Firefox 38.7.x binary package should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-38.7.0"

```

## Details

USN-2917-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update caused several

Original advisory details:

Francis Gabriel discovered a buffer overflow during ASN.1 decoding in NSS.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-1950](/security/CVE-2016-1950))

Bob Clary, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Daniel

Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Randell Jesup, Carsten Book, Gian-Carlo Pascutto,

Tyson Smith, Andrea Marchesini, and Jukka Jylänki discovered multiple

memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-1952](/security/CVE-2016-1952),

[CVE-2016-1953](/security/CVE-2016-1953))

Nicolas Golubovic discovered that CSP violation reports can be used to

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
