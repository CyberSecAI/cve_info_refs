**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Web Mailing List software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-79:** Cross-site Scripting. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

  - Defacement of the website.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely (AV:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) to exploit the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required (UI:R) for the exploit to succeed, typically involving the user clicking on a crafted link or visiting a manipulated page.
- The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C) as the malicious script executes in the user's browser, affecting the user rather than just the application itself.

**Affected Products:**
- Web Mailing List v0.31 and earlier versions.
