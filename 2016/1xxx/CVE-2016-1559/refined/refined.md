Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the exposure of administrative usernames and passwords through specific SNMP OIDs (Object Identifiers).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, specifically administrative usernames and passwords, is being disclosed via SNMP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain access to the administrative credentials of the affected D-Link devices.
*   This access could allow the attacker to control the device and potentially conduct further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SNMP Protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to send and receive SNMP requests/responses from the targeted device.
*   **Network Sniffing:** The attacker needs to sniff network traffic to capture SNMP packets containing the exposed credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target device, or have the ability to route network traffic to/from the targeted device.
*   **SNMP Knowledge:** The attacker should have knowledge of the SNMP protocol and understand how to use SNMP tools to gather information or intercept traffic.
*   **Packet Sniffing:** The attacker needs the capability to sniff network traffic to obtain the required SNMP packets.
*  **Specific OID knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the specific SNMP OIDs used to expose the information.

**Affected Devices:**

*   D-Link DAP-1353 (H/W ver. B1)
*   D-Link DAP-2553 (H/W ver. A1)
*   D-Link DAP-3520 (H/W ver. A1)

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable only if the SNMP protocol is enabled on the device.
*   The information is exposed in the text of SNMP OID string values.
*   A temporary mitigation is to disable the SNMP protocol.
*   Firmware updates are available to address this vulnerability.
