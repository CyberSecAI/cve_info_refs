**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how kintone mobile for Android manages authentication information, specifically the storage and handling of tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The application exposes authentication tokens, which could allow unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
- **Insecure Storage:** Authentication tokens are not securely stored, making them accessible to other apps or users with access to the device.
