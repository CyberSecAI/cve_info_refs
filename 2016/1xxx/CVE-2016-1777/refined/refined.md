- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RC4 cryptographic algorithm was supported by the web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The RC4 algorithm is known to have cryptographic weaknesses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to exploit weaknesses in the RC4 algorithm.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited through network communication with the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the web server, likely remotely, to exploit this vulnerability.
