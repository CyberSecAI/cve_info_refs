Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1661:

**CVE Description (from analyzed content):**

Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.94, does not ensure that frames satisfy a check for the same renderer process in addition to a Same Origin Policy check, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site, related to BindingSecurity.cpp and DOMWindow.cpp.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insufficient check in Blink that fails to verify if frames, despite passing Same Origin Policy (SOP) checks, also reside within the same renderer process. This allows cross-process frames to bypass expected security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient security check: The browser does not properly verify if frames with the same origin are also in the same renderer process.
- Incorrect assumptions: Blink assumes that passing the security origin check implies the frame is local, which is not always true for cross-process frames.
- Memory Corruption: The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption due to incorrect access across processes.
- Lack of Process isolation: In cases without full site isolation, same-origin frames in different processes can exist and communicate, potentially violating security assumptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of Service: Memory corruption can lead to a crash of the browser or its renderer process.
- Unspecified other impact: The vulnerability could potentially be used for further exploitation such as arbitrary code execution, though this is mentioned as a possibility.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves a remote attacker using a crafted website to exploit the insufficient security check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious website: An attacker must be able to create a webpage that can trigger the vulnerability.
- User interaction: The user must be tricked into opening the crafted website.
- No specific privilege required on the victim system.

**Additional Notes:**

- This issue arises due to a combination of process isolation and SOP checks.
- The vulnerability was exposed by the removal of the `swappedout://` abstraction in Chromium M49.
- The fix involves explicitly checking if a frame is remote in binding security checks.
- A test case was created to verify that frames with the same origin but in different processes behave as if they are cross-origin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 50.0.2661.94.
- Red Hat and SUSE also released security advisories and patches addressing this issue in their products
