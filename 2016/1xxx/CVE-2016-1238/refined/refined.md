```
{
  "CVE-2016-1238": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Perl's module loading mechanism includes the current working directory (\".\") in the module search path (@INC). This allows a malicious actor to create a fake module in a directory and have a Perl script load it when the script is executed from that directory.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe module loading, privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could create a malicious module and trick a user into executing a perl program from a directory which contains the malicious module, leading to arbitrary code execution and potential privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by creating a malicious module and tricking a user to execute the Perl program from a directory containing it.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create files in a directory where a user might execute a perl script."
