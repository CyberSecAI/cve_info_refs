{
  "CVE-2016-1861": {
    "Description": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the NVIDIA graphics driver for OS X. Specifically, the `nvAPIClient::Escape` method within the `IOAccelerator` user client type 0x2a0, uses a user-controlled value from the input buffer as a loop count without proper bounds checking. The `SetClocksShmoo` method, called within `Escape`, copies data into a stack buffer with a size of 0x520 bytes based on a uint16_t loop counter. This counter, after a bit shift, is only checked to be greater than 0xff, allowing an attacker to write up to 0x13ec bytes into the stack buffer, exceeding its capacity and leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient bounds checking on a user-controlled loop counter when copying data into a stack buffer in the NVIDIA graphics driver.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. The exploit code from exploit-db shows it can cause a denial of service by overwriting the stack with user controlled data, although arbitrary code execution is also possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `nvAPIClient::Escape` method of the `IOAccelerator` user client with a specific method identifier and a crafted input buffer.",
     "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to interact with the `IOAccelerator` user client, which is accessible from the Safari renderer sandbox and the Chrome GPU process sandbox on devices with the appropriate hardware (e.g., MacBook Pro)."
