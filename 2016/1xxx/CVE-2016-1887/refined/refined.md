{
  "CVE-2016-1887": {
    "Root cause": "Incorrect argument handling in the `sockargs` function, specifically the lack of a check for negative `buflen` values which allowed bypassing size checks",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The `sockargs` function did not properly validate the `buflen` argument, failing to reject negative values.",
      "The `m_get2` function allocates a fixed 256 byte buffer for negative sizes. ",
      "The `copyin` function copies a user controlled number of bytes (when cast to unsigned) into a small allocated buffer"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious local user can overwrite a large portion of kernel memory, leading to a kernel crash or arbitrary code execution with superuser privileges.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `sendmsg` system call by passing a negative value for `msg_controllen` in the `msghdr` structure, leading to the `sockargs` function which then allocates an undersized buffer and copies arbitrary user controlled data into it via `copyin`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with the ability to make system calls."
  }
