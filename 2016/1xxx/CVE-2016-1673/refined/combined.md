# oxide-qt 1.15.7-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
oxide-qt (1.15.7-0ubuntu0.14.04.1) trusty-security; urgency=medium

  * Update to v1.15.7 (see USN-2992-1)
    - Bump Chromium rev to 51.0.2704.79
    - Fix LP: [#1567542](/bugs/1567542) - Ensure the camera image is rotated correctly for both
      front and back cameras, and fix a krillin-specific issue
    - Fix LP: [#1570511](/bugs/1570511) / LP: [#1586968](/bugs/1586968) - Allow touch selection to short circuit
      context menu requests
    - Fix LP: [#1569315](/bugs/1569315) - Make WebView::EditingCapabilitiesChanged faster to
      avoid serious performance issues with an active selection
    - Disable plugins by default on arm, as we only support Flash which isn't
      available there
    - Compile native arm and x86 builds with -g1 to reduce the size of the
      resulting unstripped binary and hopefully ease address space pressure
      during linking. This will reduce the usefulness of crash reports on
      these platforms
    - Unbreak the !ENABLE_PLUGINS build
    - Fix LP: [#1582060](/bugs/1582060) - Ensure we attach the InputMethodContext for script
      opened webviews
    - Fix LP: [#1578808](/bugs/1578808) - link failure on armhf
    - Fix LP: [#1576164](/bugs/1576164) - Internationalize the camera names
    - Fix LP: [#1556658](/bugs/1556658) - Provide dummy message text to an application's custom
      beforeunload dialog component for compatibility purposes, now that
      Chromium ignores the one provided by the page
    - Fix LP: [#1535818](/bugs/1535818) - Add support for the deviceId constraint in getUserMedia
    - Fix LP: [#1568860](/bugs/1568860) - Replace use of scoped_ptr with std::unique_ptr
    - Replace CertificateErrorDispatcherClient with a callback, and add through
      unit tests for CertificateErrorDispatcher in the process
    - Add the ability to run unit tests on internal classes in shared/
    - Fix LP: [#1447395](/bugs/1447395) - Add WebView.zoomFactor API
    - Fix LP: [#1565063](/bugs/1565063) - Add 'version' and 'chromiumVersion' properties to
      the API
    - Remove CompositorProxy and its implementation. This was left over from
      when the webview compositor wasn't single threaded
    - Remove RendererFrameEvictor - it's redundant anyway because we destroy
      the webview compositor when it's hidden. Now we just drive eviction from
      there instead. This removes a bogus dependency on GetFormFactorHint
    - Hide surface_id from compositor clients, cleaning up the client interface
    - Fix LP: [#1498200](/bugs/1498200) - Componentize qt/core/ and shared/. This allows us to
      build unit test binaries that depend on shared/
    - Drop the warning when changing the process model - single process is
      now supported.
    - Adapt the QML tests to run in single-process and make lots of test fixes
      (LP: [#1399208](/bugs/1399208))
    - Fix LP: [#1399207](/bugs/1399207) - Make it possible to skip entire QML test cases where
      they aren't relevant for specific configurations (eg, single process)
    - Fix LP: [#1462814](/bugs/1462814) - Drop failing test which appears to not be useful
      anymore
    - Disable profiler timing - we don't have chrome://profiler/, and this is
      disabled by default on Chrome/Android too due to it having a
      non-negligible performance impact.
    - Fix a shutdown abort in single-process mode
    - Add CookieStoreUIProxy, which is an implementation of net::CookieStore
      that proxies calls from the UI thread to the real cookie store on the IO
      thread. This is used in a couple of places where we need access to the
      cookie store on the UI thread
    - Fix LP: [#1556762](/bugs/1556762) - Add TouchSelectionController.handleDragInProgress
      property
    - Fix LP: [#1556764](/bugs/1556764) - Add TouchSelectionController.hide() API
    - Fix LP: [#1552161](/bugs/1552161) - Convert QTouchEvent directly to ui::MotionEvent.
      Dropping the use of ui::TouchEvent means we no longer have to round
      the scroll coordinates, which should improve smoothness on high-DPI
      screens

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[614767](https://crbug.com/614767)] CVE-2016-1695: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).
