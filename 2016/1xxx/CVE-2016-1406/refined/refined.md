Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the application programming interface (API) web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager. It allows for privilege escalation through a flaw in how the API handles user requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege Escalation: An authenticated user can exploit the vulnerability to gain higher privileges on the system, potentially reaching root level access.
- Improper Access Control: The API does not properly restrict access or validate user requests, allowing an attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete System Compromise: Attackers can gain *root* level privileges in most cases, leading to full control over the affected device.
- Data Breach: With root access, attackers can access all sensitive information on the system.
- Service Disruption: Attackers can modify system configurations, leading to service disruptions or even complete system shutdowns.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning that the attacker doesn't need to have physical or local access to the system.
- API Exploitation: The attack is performed through the vulnerable API web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the vulnerable system before exploiting the vulnerability.
- Network Access: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.5, with a temporal score of 5.4, indicating a medium severity.
- Exploit code is considered functional.
- Official fix is available.
- There is no mention of known public exploits or malicious use at the time of the advisory.
- The affected products are Cisco Prime Infrastructure prior to version 3.1 and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager prior to version 1.2.4.
- No workarounds are available.
