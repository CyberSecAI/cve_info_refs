Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The HOME SPOT CUBE wireless LAN router is vulnerable to clickjacking. This means that an attacker can trick a user into clicking something on the device's administrative interface by overlaying the legitimate interface with a malicious one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a **clickjacking** issue, which occurs because the device's web interface does not implement sufficient protection against being embedded in a frame.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to perform arbitrary administrative actions on the vulnerable device. This could include changing settings or performing other actions that would normally require the user to interact directly with the device's administrative interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is **Network**.  An attacker would need to host a malicious web page that embeds the vulnerable device's management interface in an iframe. The attacker then tricks a user into visiting this page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to visit the malicious page while the user is logged into the HOME SPOT CUBE's admin interface.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges to carry out the attack other than being able to host the web page and convince someone to visit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is listed with a CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 (Medium) and CVSS v2 base score of 2.6 (Low).
- The vendor, KDDI, recommends a workaround that includes changing the login password, not accessing other websites while logged in, closing the web browser after use, and deleting saved passwords. They also recommend users consider using a different product such as HOME SPOT CUBE2.
