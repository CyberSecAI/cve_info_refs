Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-1466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) processing functions of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Instant Messaging (IM) and Presence Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of SIP packets leads to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, a malformed SIP packet can cause the `sipd` process to crash and restart.
- CWE-399: Resource Management Errors

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the Cisco SIP Proxy Daemon (`sipd`) process to restart unexpectedly.
- This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the targeted system, disrupting the IM and Presence services.
- Repeated exploitation can cause excessive disk usage due to the generation of multiple `sipd` core files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack is launched by sending malformed SIP packets to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated (Au:N).
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the targeted system.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or local access.
- The exploit complexity is low (AC:L), making exploitation relatively straightforward.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service versions 9.1(1) SU6, 9.1(1) SU6a, 9.1(1) SU7, 10.5(2) SU2, 10.5(2) SU2a, 11.0(1) SU1, and 11.5(1).
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a support case and was not publicly known before the advisory.
- Cisco has released software updates and optional packages to address the vulnerability.
- Exploitation can be identified by `sipd` process restarts and the generation of core files.
