Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1526:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `TtfUtil:LocaLookup` function within `TtfUtil.cpp` of the Libgraphite library. This function incorrectly validates a size value when handling the loca table in a crafted TTF font. Specifically, it fails to properly check if the provided `lLocaSize` is zero before proceeding with calculations, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** When the `lLocaSize` is zero, the code attempts to perform a read using the `nGlyphId` variable, which can lead to a read outside the allocated bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash in the application using the Libgraphite library, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Information Leak:** There's a potential for leaking sensitive information from memory due to the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious font file:** The attack vector is a crafted Graphite smart font (TTF file) with a malicious loca table that triggers the vulnerability in the `TtfUtil::LocaLookup` function.
*   **Application that uses Libgraphite:** An attacker can send a malicious font file to a vulnerable application, triggering the vulnerability. Applications like web browsers (Firefox), document viewers (LibreOffice), and other font rendering applications could be vulnerable if they process the crafted font file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Crafting malicious font:** An attacker needs the technical ability to create a specially crafted TTF font that exploits the size validation issue within `TtfUtil::LocaLookup`.
*   **Delivery mechanism:** The attacker needs a method to deliver the crafted font file to a vulnerable application (e.g., via a malicious website, email attachment, or file sharing).
*   **User interaction (Indirect):** The user has to open or load the crafted font through some application, which can happen automatically when viewing a website, document or similar.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the size check in `TtfUtil::LocaLookup` only happens to enforce that the glyph ID is within the valid region, but not prevent the program from processing with invalid data that bypasses the size check.
*   The fix is to add a check before the access and to reject the font immediately if the size of the loca table is invalid (0).
