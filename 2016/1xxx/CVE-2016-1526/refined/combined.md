### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1522 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1522)

#### Description

Code.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, does not consider recursive load calls during a size check, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Graphite smart font.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1330286#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-04-25 19:08:14 UTC  ``` The CESG, the Information Security Arm of GCHQ, reported that the JavaScript .watch() method could be used to overflow the 32-bit generation count of the underlying HashMap, resulting in a write to an invalid entry. Under the right conditions this write could lead to arbitrary code execution. The overflow takes considerable time and a malicious page would require a user to keep it open for the duration of the attack.   External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2016/mfsa2016-47.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1330286#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-04-25 19:08:22 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Mozilla project Upstream: CESG (the Information Security Arm of GCHQ)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1330286#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-04-26 19:45:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2016:0695 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0695.html>   ``` |  |

# USN-2902-1: graphite2 vulnerabilities

17 February 2016

graphite2 could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted font.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [graphite2](/security/cves?package=graphite2) - Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts

## Details

Yves Younan discovered that graphite2 incorrectly handled certain malformed

fonts. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-

crafted font file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause

graphite2 to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [libgraphite2-3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphite2)
  -
  [1.2.4-3ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphite2/1.2.4-3ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libgraphite2-3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphite2)
  -
  [1.2.4-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphite2/1.2.4-1ubuntu1.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart applications using

graphite2, such as LibreOffice, to make all the necessary changes.

Libgraphite mishandled a return value, which allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (missing initialization, NULL pointer
dereference, and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font.
- CVE-2016-1526: The TtfUtil:LocaLookup function in TtfUtil.cpp in
Libgraphite incorrectly validated a size value, which allowed remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2016-14

## Vulnerabilities in Graphite 2

Announced
February 11, 2016
Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox ESR, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 38.6.1
* Thunderbird 38.6

### Description

Security researcher **Holger Fuhrmannek** reported that a malicious
Graphite "smart font" could circumvent the validation of internal instruction parameters
in the Graphite 2 library using special CNTXT\_ITEM instructions. This could result in
arbitrary code execution.

This issue affected Graphite 2 version 1.3.4, which was used in the Firefox ESR branch. To address this issue and other security vulnerabilities recently disclosed by Cisco Talos affecting this version of the library, Firefox ESR has been updated to version 1.3.5, the same one used in Firefox 44.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for graphite2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2016:0791-1
Rating: important
References: #965803 #965806 #965807 #965810
Cross-References: CVE-2016-1521 CVE-2016-1522 CVE-2016-1523
CVE-2016-1526
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for graphite2 fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2016-1521: The directrun function in directmachine.cpp in
Libgraphite did not validate a certain skip operation, which allowed
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, obtain sensitive information,
or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash)
via a crafted Graphite smart font.
- CVE-2016-1522: Code.cpp in Libgraphite did not consider recursive load
calls during a size check, which allowed remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a crafted Graphite smart font.
- CVE-2016-1523: The SillMap::readFace function in FeatureMap.cpp in
Libgraphite mishandled a return value, which allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (missing initialization, NULL pointer
dereference, and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font.
- CVE-2016-1526: The TtfUtil:LocaLookup function in TtfUtil.cpp in
Libgraphite incorrectly validated a size value, which allowed remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart
font.
Patch Instructions:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Vulnerability Spotlight: Libgraphite Font Processing Vulnerabilities

By
[Earl Carter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/author/earl-carter/)

Friday, February 5, 2016 15:32

Vulnerabilities Discovered by [Yves Younan](http://blogs.cisco.com/author/YvesYounan) of Cisco Talos.

Talos is releasing an advisory for four vulnerabilities that have been found within the Libgraphite library, which is used for font processing in Linux, Firefox, LibreOffice, and other major applications. The most severe vulnerability results from an out-of-bounds read which the attacker can use to achieve arbitrary code execution. A second vulnerability is an exploitable heap overflow. Finally, the last two vulnerabilities result in denial of service situations. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker simply needs the user to run a [Graphite-enabled](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=projects&item_id=graphite_apps) application that renders a page using a specially crafted font that triggers one of these vulnerabilities. Since Mozilla Firefox versions 11-42 directly support Graphite, the attacker could easily compromise a server and then serve the specially crafted font when the user renders a page from the server (since Graphite supports both local and server-based fonts).

In this post, we will discuss the following vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2016-1521
* CVE-2016-1522
* CVE-2016-1523
* CVE-2016-1526

## Overview

[Graphite](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=projects&item_id=graphite_home) is a package that can be used to create “smart fonts” capable of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors. Basically Graphite’s smart fonts are just [TrueType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) Fonts (TTF) with added extensions. The issues that Talos identified include the following:

* An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the font handling of Libgraphite. A specially crafted font can cause an out-of-bounds read potentially resulting in an information leak or denial of service.
* A specially crafted font can cause a buffer overflow resulting in potential code execution.
* An exploitable NULL pointer dereference exists in the bidirectional font handling functionality of Libgraphite. A specially crafted font can cause a NULL pointer dereference resulting in a crash.

In each of the situations an attacker can provide a malicious font to trigger the specified vulnerability.

## Out-of-Bounds Read Details

If a malicious font is provided, an out of bounds read can occur while interpreting the opcodes in a font.

The problem occurs when executing the various opcodes in the function directrun in the file directmachine.cpp. At line 85, the interpreter for the opcodes will be executed by performing a goto instruction.

goto \*\*ip;

If the opcode in particular is a cntxt\_item, then ip variable will be advanced by iskip bytes to find the next opcode and continue interpreting the opcodes. This is done at line 369 of opcodes.h.

ip += iskip;

However there are no checks to ensure that ip remains within the bounds of the memory allocated for the memory to be interpreted (the program variable). In the case of s specially crafted malicious font, the value of iskip can be manipulated to cause an out-of-bound read when the program performs a jump to \*\*ip. This memory is memory that was previously allocated for data. This is a serious vulnerability because the out of bounds read causes the TTF virtual machine to execute code under control of the attacker. In an environment like a browser, javascript can place arbitrary bytecode in memory. Joshua "jduck" Drake showed how to use the TTF virtual machine to create generic memory read/write primitives in his [pwn2own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn2Own) java exploit last year.

## Heap Overflow Details

If a malicious font is provided then an arbitrary length buffer overflow can occur when handling context items.

In Code.cpp at lines 158-161, memory is allocated for \_code and \_data to be the expected maximum size of the code and data loaded from the bytecode. However, the actual size read from the file can be larger than the expected size.

158:     \_code = static\_cast(malloc((bytecode\_end - bytecode\_begin)

159:                                          \* sizeof(instr)));

160:     \_data = static\_cast(malloc((bytecode\_end - bytecode\_begin)

161:                                            \* sizeof(byte)));

At line 181 the function dec.load() is called with pointers to the beginning and end of the bytecode. This function, at lines 230-240, will then load opcodes from the bytecode until the end of the bytecode is reached. It will call emitopcode() at line 238 with the current value of the bytecode that is being handled.

230:      while (bc < bcend)

231:      {

232:         const opcode opc = fetchopcode(bc++);

233:         if (opc == vm::MAXOPCODE)

234: return false;

235:

236:         analyse\_opcode(opc, reinterpret\_cast<const int8 \*>(bc));

237:

238:         if (!emit\_opcode(opc, bc))

239:             return false;

240:      }

If the opcode being handled by emitopcode refers to a context item (CNTXTITEM). Then the load function will be called recursively at line 500, with a new bytecodeend that is specified by the bytecode in instrskip.

if (load(bc, bc + instr\_skip))

The size checks to ensure that data isn’t read from outside of the buffer, occur in the validateopcode function at line 548 where it is checked that the new opcode being read will be less than \_max.bytecode (which contains the value of bytecodeend).

However, when recursively handling multiple CNTXTITEMs, this means that while data is being copied to \_data, it can be read past the new bytecodeend that is specified by the recursive call to load, this will terminate the loop once it reaches there, but in the meantime more data can be read than specified by instrskip, because when validateopcode is called, the current value of bytecode will still be lower than the end of the bytecode. Doing this multiple times, results in the same memory being handled multiple times and allowing data to become larger than bytecode allowing an out-of-bounds write. The same can occur with the code buffer. A proposed fix is to ensure that when returning from a CNTXTITEM, the current value of bytecode minus the begin value of bytecode is larger or equal to datasize and instrcount. A similar check to what is performed via an assert at lines 210 and 211.

## Denial of Service Details

The first denial of service issue results from a NULL pointer deference. When the font is loaded via grmakefile\_face, the function readFeats will be called at line 190 in the file FeatureMap.cpp in the function SillMap::readFace.

if (!m\_FeatureMap.readFeats(face)) return false;

At line 110, in the function readFeats, mnumFeats will be assigned the value 0. This results in a return from the readFeats function at line 115. However the return will return the value true. This results in none of the variables in mFeatureMap being initialized even though the font will load without any errors being returned. If the function grmakeseg is later called on this font, the call to SillMap::cloneFeatures will fail at line 241 because it tries to dereference mFeatureMap.mdefaultFeatures, which is set to 0.

return new Features (\*m\_FeatureMap.m\_defaultFeatures);

A similar error can occur at line 103 in the same function if the constructor for Table fails.

The second denial of service issue results from an out of bounds read that can not only cause a DoS, but it can also cause a leak of information. When reading an invalid font where the local table size is set to 0, an out of bounds read will occur.

At line 187 in GlyphCache.cpp, the function Loader is defined which loads a number of tables from the font, including the loca table. At line 206 it will then call the function TtfUtil:LocaLookup with arguments that provide the number of glyphs, the loca table and its size:

if (TtfUtil::LocaLookup(numglyphsgraphics-1, \_loca, \_loca.size(), \_head) == sizet(-1))

At line 1164 in this function (in file TtfUtil.cpp), the loca table will be accessed using the number of glyphs:

return be::peek(pLongTable + nGlyphId);

A size check is performed at line 1161, but since the size is set to 0, this will always pass.

if (nGlyphId < (lLocaSize >> 2) - 1)

This will read out of the bounds of the table by an arbitrary 16-byte number, which will cause a denial of service and could potentially lead to an information leak.

## Known Vulnerable Versions:

Libgraphite 2-1.2.4

Firefox 31-42

## Conclusion

Finding and disclosing zero-day vulnerabilities responsibly helps improve the overall security of the devices and software people use on a day-to-day basis.  Talos is committed to this effort via developing programmatic ways to identify problems or flaws that could be otherwise exploited by malicious attackers. These developments help secure the platforms and software customers use and also help provide insight into how Cisco can improve its own processes to develop better products. To continually enhance their security posture, customers should always update the software that they use to the most recent versions to take advantage of the latest security updates.

In addition, Talos has released rules that detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities to protect our customers. Please note that additional rules may be released at a future date and current rules are subject to change pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Defense Center, FireSIGHT Management Center or Snort.org.

Snort Rules: 36216,36213, 36217 36225-36228  36385-88

Description:
This update for graphite2 fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2016-1521: The directrun function in directmachine.cpp in
Libgraphite did not validate a certain skip operation, which allowed
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, obtain sensitive information,
or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash)
via a crafted Graphite smart font.
- CVE-2016-1523: The SillMap::readFace function in FeatureMap.cpp in
Libgraphite mishandled a return value, which allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (missing initialization, NULL pointer
dereference, and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font.
- CVE-2016-1526: The TtfUtil:LocaLookup function in TtfUtil.cpp in
Libgraphite incorrectly validated a size value, which allowed remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart
font.

# CVE-2016-1521

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1517.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1522.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1521 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1521)

#### Description

The directrun function in directmachine.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, does not validate a certain skip operation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font.

# CVE-2016-1523

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1522.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1526.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1523 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1523)

#### Description

The SillMap::readFace function in FeatureMap.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, mishandles a return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (missing initialization, NULL pointer dereference, and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0594)

## Topic

An update for graphite2 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Graphite2 is a project within SIL's Non-Roman Script Initiative and Language Software Development groups to provide rendering capabilities for complex non-Roman writing systems. Graphite can be used to create "smart fonts" capable of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors. With respect to the Text Encoding Model, Graphite handles the "Rendering" aspect of writing system implementation.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: graphite2 (1.3.6).

Security Fix(es):

* Various vulnerabilities have been discovered in Graphite2. An attacker able to trick an unsuspecting user into opening specially crafted font files in an application using Graphite2 could exploit these flaws to cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application. (CVE-2016-1521, CVE-2016-1522, CVE-2016-1523, CVE-2016-1526)

# CVE-2016-1526

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1523.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1531.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1526 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1526)

#### Description

The TtfUtil:LocaLookup function in TtfUtil.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, incorrectly validates a size value, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted Graphite smart font.
