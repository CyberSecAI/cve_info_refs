victim. (CVE-2016-1612, CVE-2016-1613, CVE-2016-1614, CVE-2016-1615,
CVE-2016-1616, CVE-2016-1617, CVE-2016-1618, CVE-2016-1619, CVE-2016-1620,
CVE-2016-2051, CVE-2016-2052)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain Chromium version 48.0.2564.82, which corrects these issues.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine library for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

A bad cast was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-1612](/security/CVE-2016-1612))

An issue was discovered when initializing the UnacceleratedImageBufferSurface

class in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2016-1614](/security/CVE-2016-1614))

An issue was discovered with the CSP implementation in Blink. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to determine whether specific HSTS sites had been

visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-1617](/security/CVE-2016-1617))

An issue was discovered with random number generator in Blink. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to defeat cryptographic protection

mechanisms. ([CVE-2016-1618](/security/CVE-2016-1618))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1620](/security/CVE-2016-1620))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-2051](/security/CVE-2016-2051))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Harfbuzz. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2016-2052](/security/CVE-2016-2052))

  -
  [1.12.5-0ubuntu0.15.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/oxide-qt/1.12.5-0ubuntu0.15.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [liboxideqtcore0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/oxide-qt)
  -
  [1.12.5-0ubuntu0.15.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/oxide-qt/1.12.5-0ubuntu0.15.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [liboxideqtcore0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/oxide-qt)
  -
  [1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/oxide-qt/1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/01/stable-channel-update_20.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, January 20, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 48 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 48.0.2564.82 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/47.0.2526.111..48.0.2564.82?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 48.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [37 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M48&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[579625](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=579625)] CVE-2016-1620: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.8 branch (currently 4.8.271.17).

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer) or [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

[CVE-2016-1617 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1617)

#### Description

The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.82, does not apply http policies to https URLs and does not apply ws policies to wss URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report.
