    "details": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the WebRTC Audio Private API within browser/extensions/api/webrtc_audio_private/webrtc_audio_private_api.cc. The vulnerability is due to incorrect reliance on the resource context pointer, which can become a dangling pointer. This occurs when the resource context is freed, but the pointer is still used, leading to the use-after-free."
