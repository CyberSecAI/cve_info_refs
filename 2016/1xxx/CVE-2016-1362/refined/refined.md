Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1362

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the web-based management interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) devices running Cisco AireOS Software. This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a device reload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of requests within the web-based management interface.
- Lack of proper authentication or input validation leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation results in the affected Cisco WLC device reloading, causing a service interruption and loss of network connectivity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- Network access: Attackers need to have network connectivity to the vulnerable device's management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated access to the WLC management interface.
- Ability to send malicious requests to the WLC device.

**Additional Details:**
- Vulnerable products include Cisco WLC devices running specific versions of Cisco AireOS Software (4.1 through 7.4.120.0, all 7.5 releases, and 7.6.100.0).
- Devices running Cisco AireOS Software Release 8.0 or later are not affected.
- Exploitation can be identified by the device reloading and generating a crash file.
- Workaround: Implementing a CPU access control list (ACL) on the management interface can mitigate the vulnerability.
- Fixed software releases are available, and it is recommended to upgrade to the appropriate release.
- The CVSS base score is 7.8, and the temporal score is 6.4. The vector string is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
