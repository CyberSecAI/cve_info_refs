- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A semaphore deadlock issue within the Graphics driver of certain Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the graphics driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application can cause a semaphore deadlock, leading to system crashes.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attacker must trick a user into installing a malicious application. This malicious app then triggers the deadlock.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to install a crafted malicious application on the target device.
