Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-1054:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs during the handling of OCG (Optional Content Group) objects within the `WillSave` document action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free:** A dangling pointer to an OCG object is reused after the memory it points to has been freed. This can lead to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user's Acrobat/Reader application). This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker can embed a specially crafted OCG object within a PDF file. When a user opens this malicious PDF, the vulnerability is triggered.
- **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when visited by a user with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat/Reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create or distribute a malicious PDF file or control a webpage that can deliver a crafted document to a vulnerable user.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated or have special privileges on the target system but requires user interaction (opening the document/visiting a webpage).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS score of 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P), indicating a medium severity.
