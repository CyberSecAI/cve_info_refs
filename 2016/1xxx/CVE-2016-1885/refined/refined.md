Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer signedness error within the `amd64_set_ldt()` function in the FreeBSD kernel. This function is responsible for managing the Local Descriptor Table (LDT) entries for 32-bit applications running on the 64-bit version of the OS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Signedness Error (CWE-196):** The `largest_ld` variable, which is intended to store the sum of a start index and a number of descriptors (`uap->start + uap->num`), is a signed integer. The code attempts to prevent an out-of-bounds access by comparing `largest_ld` with `max_ldt_segment` (1024). However, because `largest_ld` is signed, an attacker can provide a negative value for `uap->num` to bypass the bounds check. This can lead to `largest_ld` having a very large positive value due to integer wraparound when calculating `i = largest_ld - uap->start;`
- **Heap Overflow:** The vulnerability occurs because of a signedness error which allows calculating a huge value `i`, which is then used as a size parameter in `bzero()`, leading to a heap overflow when `bzero()` writes beyond the allocated LDT memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The heap overflow can cause the kernel to panic, resulting in a system crash. A local, unprivileged attacker can trigger this, effectively causing a local denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is locally exploitable, meaning an attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **`i386_set_ldt` system call:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `i386_set_ldt` system call with specific arguments. The attacker provides a negative number as the `num_sels` argument, along with a NULL pointer for the descriptors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges since the vulnerability is exploitable from user mode.
- The attacker needs to call the `i386_set_ldt` syscall.
- They must provide a crafted `i386_ldt_args` structure with a negative `num` argument.
- To reach the vulnerable code, the attacker needs to add at least one initial entry to the process LDT.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `amd64_set_ldt` function located in `/sys/amd64/amd64/sys_machdep.c`.
- The vulnerable code path is executed when the third argument of the `amd64_set_ldt` function is NULL, which happens when `i386_set_ldt` syscall is called with a NULL `descs` argument.
- The vulnerability affects the amd64 architecture of FreeBSD and potentially other versions than 10.2
- The advisory was initially released on March 16, 2016, with a revised patch released on October 25, 2016 to address an issue discovered by ahaha from Chaitin Tech.

**Patches and Workarounds:**
- Patches are available for various FreeBSD stable, release, and security branches.
- Users are advised to upgrade to patched versions of FreeBSD or apply the provided patches and recompile the kernel.
