Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1341:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a default credential issue in the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender software. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Default Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of default credentials that are not properly secured or changed during initial device setup.
- **Insufficient Authentication:** The system fails to properly validate login attempts, allowing unauthorized access using the default credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated local attacker to gain root user privileges on the system shell.
- **Complete System Compromise:** With root access, the attacker has full control over the affected device, potentially leading to data breaches, system disruptions, or further network compromises.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a "Complete" impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable device to exploit this vulnerability. This could be physical access to the device or potentially remote access through another vulnerability on the same network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to be aware of or able to discover the default credentials used to gain unauthorized access.

**Additional Notes**
- **No Workarounds:** Cisco states that there are no workarounds available for this vulnerability. This means patching is necessary to mitigate the risk.
- **Exploitability:**  The exploit is considered "Functional," meaning that an exploit exists and works in most situations where the vulnerability is present.
- **No Public Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory, Cisco was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **Base Score:** 6.9 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
   - Access Vector: Local
   - Access Complexity: Medium
   - Authentication: None
   - Confidentiality Impact: Complete
   - Integrity Impact: Complete
   - Availability Impact: Complete
- **Temporal Score:** 6.6 (E:F/RL:U/RC:C)
    - Exploitability: Functional
    - Remediation Level: Unavailable
    - Report Confidence: Confirmed

This analysis provides more detail than the basic CVE description, including the specific affected product, the root cause of the vulnerability being default credentials, the lack of workarounds, and the confirmed state of the exploit.
