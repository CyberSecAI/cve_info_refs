Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1207

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web interface of I-O DATA DEVICE, INC.'s WN-G300R series of wireless LAN routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is specifically a stored XSS (CWE-79). This means the malicious script is saved within the application (router's configuration) and executed when a user interacts with the affected area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser when they access the router's configuration pages. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the router's management interface.
  - Redirecting the user to malicious sites
  - Data theft
  - Performing unauthorized administrative actions on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the adjacent network (local network). The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
- **High Privileges:** To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs administrative privileges on the router. This may involve having valid credentials or exploiting another vulnerability in the router.
- **User Interaction:**  The user needs to access the affected part of the router's web interface for the malicious script to be executed.

**Affected Products:**
- WN-G300R firmware Ver.1.12 and earlier
- WN-G300R2 firmware Ver.1.12 and earlier
- WN-G300R3 firmware Ver.1.01 and earlier

**Mitigation:**
- Update the firmware of the affected routers to the latest versions provided by I-O DATA DEVICE, INC.
   - WN-G300R: Ver. 1.13
   - WN-G300R2: Ver. 1.13
   - WN-G300R3: Ver 1.02

**CVSS Scores:**
- **CVSS v3:** 4.3 (Medium)  AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
- **CVSS v2:** 2.3 (Low) AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N
