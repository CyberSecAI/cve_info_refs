Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the HTTP URL redirect feature of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software.
*   A buffer overflow condition can occur due to improper handling of HTTP URLs during redirection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, triggered by specially crafted HTTP URL redirect requests.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The vulnerability indicates a lack of proper input validation or sanitization of the URL strings, leading to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service condition on the affected device.
*   **Device Reload/Crash:** Exploitation can cause the affected WLC to reload, effectively taking it offline, and generate a crash file.
*   **Complete System Compromise (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, a buffer overflow vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code which can lead to more serious system compromise than a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP:** The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests, specifically targeting the URL redirect feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** An attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability; it can be triggered remotely without any credentials.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable WLC.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** An attacker would need the ability to craft malformed HTTP requests with the goal of overflowing the buffer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS base score of 10.0.
*   Cisco states that the vulnerability was found during internal testing.
*   There are no known workarounds.
*   The advisory lists specific affected versions and provides the corresponding fixes.
*   The provided CVSS vector is `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C`. This translates to:
    *   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   **Au:N** (Authentication: None)
    *   **C:C** (Confidentiality Impact: Complete)
    *   **I:C** (Integrity Impact: Complete)
    *   **A:C** (Availability Impact: Complete)
    *   **E:F** (Exploitability: Functional)
    *  **RL:OF** (Remediation Level: Official Fix)
    *   **RC:C** (Report Confidence: Confirmed)

This information is consistent with a buffer overflow vulnerability, and provides more detail than the generic CVE description placeholder.
