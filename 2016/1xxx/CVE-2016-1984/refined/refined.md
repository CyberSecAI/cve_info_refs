        "vulnerability": "Deliberately hidden backdoor account",
        "details": "The binary /bin/bw implements a function called \"setUpSubtleUserAccount\", which is called on system boot. This function adds an administrative account with hardcoded credentials to the user database. Functions to retrieve a list of all users in the database were found to deliberately hide this user. Using this backdoor account grants additional features on the remote-cli, such as a facility to capture packets on the network interface which not even an administrator account can perform. The backdoor did not get removed by AMX in their first patch, but the backdoor username has only been changed to a DC superhero name. The new username now was: 1MB@tMaN",
