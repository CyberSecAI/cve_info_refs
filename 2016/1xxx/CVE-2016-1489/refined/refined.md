Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of encryption during file transfers in Lenovo SHAREit for both Windows and Android platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311):** Files are transferred via HTTP in plain text, without any encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** An attacker who can intercept network traffic can view the contents of the files being transferred.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can potentially modify the content of the transferred files, leading to data corruption or malicious modification.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the devices transferring files using Lenovo SHAREit.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker can position themselves between the sender and receiver to intercept and potentially modify the traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the devices transferring files.
- They need to be capable of sniffing network traffic (e.g., using tools like Wireshark).
- For a MitM attack, the attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the sender and receiver.
