Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1059:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Acrobat Reader DC handles ScriptProxy objects within ExtendScript.
- A specially crafted PDF can trigger a use-after-free condition. This happens when a dangling pointer is reused after the memory it points to has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Improper handling of ScriptProxy objects in ExtendScript.
- Dangling pointers are present, and the program does not ensure they are valid before dereferencing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- The attacker can gain control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious PDF document is crafted to trigger the vulnerability.
- The user needs to either visit a malicious webpage or open the malicious PDF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or distribute a malicious PDF file.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the malicious PDF.
- The attacker has to have some degree of knowledge about the internal workings of Adobe Reader's ExtendScript and ScriptProxy objects.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader DC on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of the HPE Zero Day Initiative.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious website).
