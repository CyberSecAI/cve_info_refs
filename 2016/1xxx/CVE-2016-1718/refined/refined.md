Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate a user-supplied index within the `IOAcceleratorFamily2` interface. Specifically, the code doesn't check if the index is within the bounds of an array before using it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds indexing vulnerability. A user-supplied index is not validated against array bounds before access.
- Memory corruption: due to the out-of-bounds write, memory corruption can occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker can elevate their privileges and execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- User interaction is required since the target user must open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable machine.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious file.

**Additional details from the ZDI advisory:**
- The vulnerability is within the `IOAcceleratorFamily2` interface.
- The vulnerability was reported on 2015-11-02 and publicly disclosed on 2016-01-22.

The Apple advisory confirms that the vulnerability exists within the `IOAcceleratorFamily` and it was addressed through improved memory handling. The advisory also states a local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
