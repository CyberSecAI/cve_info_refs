  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-1608",
    "description": "The appliance administrative interface allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands. Please note that an attacker can combine this vulnerability with vulnerability #1. In this scenario, an attacker does not need to be authenticated.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize input, allowing for the injection of OS commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the Filr server as the root user, potentially leading to complete compromise of the appliance.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By exploiting a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2016-1607) in combination with this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands without authentication.",
      "Through the administrative interface by an authenticated user."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to directly exploit the vulnerability. However, when chained with a CSRF vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can gain access to execute commands by targeting an authenticated administrator."
