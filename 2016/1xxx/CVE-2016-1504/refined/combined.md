| [Description](#c0)  Matthew    2004-07-14 21:40:14 UTC  ``` I am using korganizer with Kontact. I recently upped to KDE 3.3.0_beta1 and for a while it was working fine. Then today it stopped working. All my contact information is gone, as is my schedule. It appears to not be reading my calender file. This seems to have conincded with the mysterious disappearance of the .kde3.2 directory in my home directory. Anyways I cannot save my schedule nor contacts in korganizer. They just disappear after closing and reopening Kontact. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthew    2004-07-14 21:41:45 UTC  ``` Oh yes, I forgot to leave my "emerge info"  Portage 2.0.50-r9 (default-x86-1.4, gcc-3.3.4, glibc-2.3.4.20040619-r0, 2.6.7) ================================================================= System uname: 2.6.7 i686 Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.53GHz Gentoo Base System version 1.5.1 Autoconf: sys-devel/autoconf-2.59-r4 Automake: sys-devel/automake-1.8.5-r1 ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="x86 ~x86" AUTOCLEAN="yes" CFLAGS="-march=pentium4 -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer" CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu" COMPILER="gcc3" CONFIG_PROTECT="/etc /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb /usr/kde/2/share/config /usr/kde/3.3/share/config /usr/kde/3/share/config /usr/share/config /var/qmail/control" CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK="/etc/gconf /etc/terminfo /etc/env.d" CXXFLAGS="-march=pentium4 -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer" DISTDIR="/usr/portage/distfiles" FEATURES="autoaddcvs ccache sandbox" GENTOO_MIRRORS="<http://128.213.5.34/gentoo/> <http://gentoo.mirrors.pair.com/> <http://open-systems.ufl.edu/mirrors/gentoo>" MAKEOPTS="-j2" PKGDIR="/usr/portage/packages" PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp" PORTDIR="/usr/portage" PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/portage" SYNC="rsync://rsync.namerica.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage" USE="X alsa apache2 apm avi cdr crypt cups dvd encode flac flash foomaticdb gdbm gif gpm gtk2 imlib java jpeg kde libg++ libwww lirc mad mikmod mmx motif mpeg mysql ncurses nls nvidia oggvorbis opengl oss pam pda pdflib perl png ppds python qt quicktime readline samba sdl slang spell sse ssl svga tcpd truetype usb x86 xml2 xmms xv zlib" ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Matthew    2004-07-19 20:44:47 UTC  ``` I was finally after much searching able to resolve this bug, in Settings--->Configure KAddressBook there is a "resources" section where you can define where it looks for the address book files.

Subject: CVE id request: dhcpcd

dhcpcd recently fixed two security issues. Can you assign CVE ids to these?

<http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/info/76a1609352263bd9>
can lead to a heap overflow via malformed dhcp responses later in print_option (via dhcp_envoption1) due to incorrect option length values. exploitation is non-trivial, but i'd love to be proven wrong.

<http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/info/595883e2a431f65d>
can lead to an invalid read/crash via malformed dhcp responses. not exploitable beyond DoS as far as I can judge.

Kind regards,
Nico

# dhcpcd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201606-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in dhcpcd allowing remote
attackers to possibly execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/dhcpcd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.10.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.10.0** |

### Background

A fully featured, yet light weight RFC2131 compliant DHCP client

### Description

A heap overflow can be triggered via malformed DHCP responses in the
print\_option (via dhcp\_envoption1) due to incorrect option length values.
These vulnerabilities could also allow remote attackers to trigger an
invalid read/crash via malformed DHCP responses.

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or cause Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All dhcpcd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/dhcpcd-6.10.0”

```
