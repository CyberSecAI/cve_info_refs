"text": "A vulnerability in the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) of Cisco IOS Software running on the Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches and Cisco NX-OS Software running on the Cisco Nexus 7000 and Nexus 7700 Series Switches with an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the vulnerable device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation when a malformed LISP packet header is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed LISP packet on UDP port 4341. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 23, 2016, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes six Cisco Security Advisories that describe six vulnerabilities. All the vulnerabilities have a Security Impact Rating of \"High.\" For a complete list of advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/event-response/cisco-erp-march-2016.html\"]."

"text": "Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches running Cisco IOS Software, and Cisco Nexus 7000 and Nexus 7700 Series Switches with an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module running Cisco NX-OS Software are vulnerable when LISP is configured. LISP is not enabled by default on either platform.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software versions are vulnerable, see the \"Fixed Software\" section of this advisory. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nLISP support was first introduced in release 15.1(1)SY1. To determine if LISP is configured on the device, use the show running-config | include lisp command to see if router lisp is configured, as shown in the following example:\n\r\n\n\r\niosRouter# show running-config | include lisp\n\r\nrouter lisp\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(1)SY1 with an installed image name of c6880x-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:\n\r\n\n\r\niosRouter# show version\nCisco IOS Software, c6880x Software (c6880x-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(1)SY1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc5)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Mon 11-May-15 00:26 by prod\_rel\_team\n.\n.\n.\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nNexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches added LISP support in software release 5.2(1). The Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with LISP configured are vulnerable only if the LISP packet is input on an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module. Use the show module | include M1 command to check whether an M1 module is installed in the Nexus 7000 chassis, as shown in the following example:\n\r\n\n\r\nnxosRouter# show module | include M1\n\r\n3    48     10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet XL Module N7K-M148GT-11L     powered-up\r\nIf there is an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module installed, it will be vulnerable only if LISP packets are input to interfaces configured on this module. To check whether the LISP feature is enabled, use the show feature | include lisp command, as in the following example:\n\r\n\n\r\nnxosRouter# show feature | include lisp\n\r\nlisp                  1         enabled\r\nThe show ip lisp command can be used to determine the LISP configuration for the M1 interfaces:\n\r\n\n\r\nnxosRouter# show ip lisp \n\r\nLISP IP Configuration Information for VRF \"default\" (iid 1)\n\r\n  Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR):enabled\n\r\n  Egress Tunnel Router (ETR):disabled\n\r\n  Proxy-ITR Router (PTR):disabled\n\r\n  Proxy-ETR Router (PETR):disabled\n\r\n  Map Resolver (MR):disabled\n\r\n  Map Server (MS):disabled\n\r\n  LISP Multicast:disabled\n\r\n.\n.\n.\r\nFor more information on the Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches LISP Configuration, see Configuring Locator/ID Separation Protocol[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/lisp/configuration/guide/b\_NX-OS\_LISP\_Configuration\_Guide/b\_NX-OS\_LISP\_Configuration\_Guide\_chapter\_01.html\"]. \n\r\n\n\r\nDetermine the Cisco NX-OS Software Release\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco NX-OS Software release that is running on a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command. The following example identifies the 6.2(14) release:\n\r\n\n\r\nnxosRouter# show version\n\r\nCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software\n\r\nTAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac\n\r\nDocuments: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9372/tsd\_products\_support\_series\_home.html\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2002-2015, Cisco Systems, Inc.

"text": "The LISP network architecture and protocol implements a new semantic for IP addressing by creating two new namespaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), which are assigned to end hosts, and Routing Locators (RLOCs), which are assigned to devices (primarily routers) that make up the global routing system. Splitting EID and RLOC functions improves routing system scalability, multihoming efficiency, and ingress traffic engineering. LISP end site support is configured on devices such as Cisco routers. This vulnerability is present for any type of LISP configuration in which a LISP packet is input on an affected interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches and the Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module share a common ASIC, which could crash when a malformed LISP packet is received. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the LISP packet must be destined to UDP port number 4341, which is the well-known port number for LISP, the UDP LISP header must be malformed, and the header length must be incorrect.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn the Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches this vulnerability results in a complete reload of the device. On the Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module installed, the M1 module itself reloads but the rest of the chassis remains stable.\n"

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches running Cisco IOS Software, and Cisco Nexus 7000 and Nexus 7700 Series Switches with an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module running Cisco NX-OS Software are vulnerable when LISP is configured. LISP is not enabled by default on either platform.      For information about which Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software versions are vulnerable, see the "Fixed Software" section of this advisory.       **Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches**   LISP support was first introduced in release 15.1(1)SY1. To determine if LISP is configured on the device, use the **show running-config | include lisp** command to see if **router lisp** is configured, as shown in the following example:   ```   iosRouter# show running-config | include lisp   router lisp   ```   **Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release**      To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to **Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software** or **Cisco IOS Software**. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name.      The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(1)SY1 with an installed image name of c6880x-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:   ```   iosRouter# show versionCisco IOS Software, c6880x Software (c6880x-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(1)SY1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc5)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Mon 11-May-15 00:26 by prod_rel_team...   ```   Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html).      **Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches**   The Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches added LISP support in software release 5.2(1). The Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with LISP configured are vulnerable only if the LISP packet is input on an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module. Use the **show module | include M1** command to check whether an M1 module is installed in the Nexus 7000 chassis, as shown in the following example:   ```   nxosRouter# show module | include M1   3    48     10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet XL Module N7K-M148GT-11L     powered-up   ```   If there is an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module installed, it will be vulnerable only if LISP packets are input to interfaces configured on this module. To check whether the LISP feature is enabled, use the **show feature | include lisp** command, as in the following example:   ```   nxosRouter# show feature | include lisp   lisp                  1         enabled   ```   The **show ip lisp** command can be used to determine the LISP configuration for the M1 interfaces:   ```   nxosRouter# show ip lisp    LISP IP Configuration Information for VRF "default" (iid 1)     Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR):enabled     Egress Tunnel Router (ETR):disabled     Proxy-ITR Router (PTR):disabled     Proxy-ETR Router (PETR):disabled     Map Resolver (MR):disabled     Map Server (MS):disabled     LISP Multicast:disabled   ...   ```   For more information on the Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches LISP Configuration, see [Configuring Locator/ID Separation Protocol](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/lisp/configuration/guide/b_NX-OS_LISP_Configuration_Guide/b_NX-OS_LISP_Configuration_Guide_chapter_01.html).       **Determine the Cisco NX-OS Software Release**      To determine the Cisco NX-OS Software release that is running on a Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command. The following example identifies the 6.2(14) release:   ```   nxosRouter# show version   Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software   TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac   Documents: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9372/tsd_products_support_series_home.html   Copyright (c) 2002-2015, Cisco Systems, Inc.

Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS-XR and Cisco IOS-XE.       Cisco 7600 Series Routers are not affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The LISP network architecture and protocol implements a new semantic for IP addressing by creating two new namespaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), which are assigned to end hosts, and Routing Locators (RLOCs), which are assigned to devices (primarily routers) that make up the global routing system. Splitting EID and RLOC functions improves routing system scalability, multihoming efficiency, and ingress traffic engineering. LISP end site support is configured on devices such as Cisco routers. This vulnerability is present for any type of LISP configuration in which a LISP packet is input on an affected interface.      The Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches and the Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module share a common ASIC, which could crash when a malformed LISP packet is received. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the LISP packet must be destined to UDP port number 4341, which is the well-known port number for LISP, the UDP LISP header must be malformed, and the header length must be incorrect.      On the Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches this vulnerability results in a complete reload of the device. On the Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module installed, the M1 module itself reloads but the rest of the chassis remains stable.  Indicators of Compromise  * On Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches, an exploit of this vulnerability causes the device to reload with a reset reason of **EARL Recovery Patch errors**.       On Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module, this vulnerability causes the M1 module to reload with a reset reason of **Fatal Interrupt Metropolis device error**.      Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) should review the system log file to determine if the device has been affected by this vulnerability.
