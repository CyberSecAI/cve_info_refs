Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when a malformed Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) packet header is received by Cisco IOS and NX-OS software. Specifically, the issue arises when the UDP LISP header is malformed and the header length is incorrect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation for LISP packets.
- Vulnerability lies in the common ASIC shared by Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches, and Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Modules.
- Lack of validation of the LISP header length and format, which leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service condition.
  - On Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches, the device completely reloads.
  - On Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with M1 modules, only the M1 module reloads, while the rest of the chassis remains stable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a malformed LISP packet.
- The malformed LISP packet must be sent on UDP port 4341, the well-known port for LISP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the targeted device.
- No authentication is required, as the vulnerability is triggered by a malformed packet.
- The attacker needs to have the knowledge to craft a malformed LISP packet, specifically with an incorrect header length.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected products include Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches running Cisco IOS Software, and Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module running Cisco NX-OS Software when LISP is configured.
- The vulnerability is present in any LISP configuration where the malformed packet is received on an affected interface.
- LISP is not enabled by default on either platform.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a LISP packet destined to UDP port 4341 with a malformed UDP header.
- On Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches, the device reload is indicated by a reset reason of "EARL Recovery Patch errors."
- On Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches with M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module, the M1 module reload is indicated by a reset reason of "Fatal Interrupt Metropolis device error."
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 7.8 (for the Catalyst switches) and 5.0 (for Nexus switches), with a temporal score of 6.4 and 4.1 respectively.
- There are no workarounds available, and a software fix is required.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a customer case handled by the Cisco TAC.
