Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the web bridge component of Cisco Meeting Server Software, specifically how it handles video via a web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web bridge is susceptible to a persistent XSS attack, which means the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when other users access it.
-  CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). This is identified as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can inject malicious script into the web interface of the Cisco Meeting Server.
- When a user accesses the web interface, the injected script is executed, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal sensitive information like session cookies
    - Redirect the user to malicious websites
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can be located remotely and does not require any access to the internal network.
- **Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability
- **Web Interface:** The attack targets users accessing the web interface of the Cisco Meeting Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script through the vulnerable web bridge component.
- The attacker does not need any specific permissions or to be authenticated to the system.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable web interface or access to it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server Software releases 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9.
- It is fixed in releases 1.7.24, 1.8.15, and 1.9.2 and later.
- No workarounds are available.
- There is no known public announcement or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
- The CVSS Base Score is 4.3 and the Temporal Score is 3.6

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited.
