    "description": "The ModuleSystem::RequireForJsInner function in extensions/renderer/module_system.cc in the Extensions subsystem in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.75 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted web site, aka \"Universal XSS (UXSS).\"",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A universal cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling in the extension bindings component of the Chromium browser. Specifically, the `ModuleSystem::RequireForJsInner` function in `extensions/renderer/module_system.cc` does not properly validate input, allowing for injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into a vulnerable browser. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, session hijacking, or the execution of malicious code within the context of the user's browser session.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker can inject malicious code via a crafted web page"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious webpage that when visited by a victim, it will trigger the vulnerability.",

        "Chromium browser",
        "ModuleSystem::RequireForJsInner function",
        "Extension bindings"
      ],
       "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in the extensions subsystem, particularly in the handling of bindings. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized script execution in the context of the browser. The severity is rated as 'Important' by Red Hat and 'critical' by SUSE."
