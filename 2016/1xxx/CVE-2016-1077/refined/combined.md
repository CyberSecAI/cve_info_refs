The Complete Guide To Servicing Your Road Bike

Introduction

Riding a bike is an unparalleled experience, the thrill of the wind rushing through your hair;
the rush of pedalling your heart out whilst racing uphill… it’s a feeling like no other. But in
order to ensure this feeling lasts as long as possible, it’s essential that your bike is properly
cared for. It’s with this mind that we at Merlin Cycles have put together this comprehensive
user guide detailing everything you need to know about servicing a road bicycle.

Whether you’ve just bought your first road bike or you are simply looking to save some
money and maintain your cycle yourself, this guide will outline everything you can do to
keep your hardware peak condition.

Why Do It Yourself?

If you’re a long time cyclist, chances are you’ve had to have some work done on your bike
in the past. Whilst you yourself may have occasionally replaced the chain or changed your
gear cable, but when it comes to actually getting your hands dirty and fiddling with the
technical parts, many people prefer to take their bike to a specialist, or back to the store
from whence it was brought.

Of course there’s nothing wrong with this. These are trained professionals whose job it is to
help you, and there will be some issues which are probably best dealt with by an
experienced professional; but you could often save yourself the trouble by actually carrying
out the majority of work yourself.

Even if you’re a complete novice when it comes to mechanics, it’s never been easier to
service your own bike. There are thousands of resources and guides (much like this one)
that are freely available to you via the web.

There are three main reasons you should consider doing your own bike maintenance:

1.  It saves you money

Taking your bike to be repaired can be a very expensive endeavour. Bike store staff
are purposefully employed to fix your bicycle at a set rate, even if it only takes 10
seconds to do. By maintaining your cycle yourself you’re eliminating what is often a
completely unnecessary spend.

Even after you’ve invested in all the specific tools (and trust us, they  are certainly a
wise investment), you’ll find that over time you end up saving yourself considerable
amounts.

2.  It saves you time

Finding the time in day-to-day life to travel to the shop and have your bike looked at
can often be incredibly difficult.,

The Complete Guide To Servicing Your Road Bike

Bike stores, especially local ones, are often so busy that they either have to make
customers book appointments or simply refuse to service any models they didn’t sell
themselves.

This can of course lead to people going days, if not weeks, without their bike – not
an ideal solution. Instead of waiting around without being able to ride, why not learn
how to fix it yourself? You’ll be back on the road in no time.

3.  It keeps your bike in its peak condition

When was the last time you gave your cycle a proper once over? Are you sure that
everything is running as smoothly as possible?

Once you know what you’re looking for, you can check your bike over after every
ride. Gone will be the days when you have to wait until something breaks to have it
fixed; with this handy guide at your disposal you’ll be able to identify and repair
problems, ensuring your bike is at its best.

The Tools:

First of all you’ll need to make sure you’ve got the right tools for the job. Below we’ve
assembled a list of essential equipment you’ll need to get the job done properly. These
items can all be purchased from your local hardware or bike stores, and having them to
hand will save you considerable amounts of money in the long run:

  Chain Tool
  Set of Allen Keys
  Spoke Wrench
  Torx Wrench
  Hex Wrench Set
  Adjustable Spanner
  Small Screwdriver
  Bracket Removal Tool
  Cable Cutter
  Floor Pump
  Wet Lubrication
  Degreaser
  Cable Caps
  Garden Hose, With Adjustable Spray Nozzle
  Cleaning Brushes
  Cloths Or Rags
  Bucket And Sponge

3

The Complete Guide To Servicing Your Road Bike

These 17 items should make up your essential bike repair kit. You may already have some
pieces lying around at home. Most homes with gardens will already have access to a hose
for example, and cloths and rags can made from old clothes or dishcloths.

Furthermore, you can reduce costs considerably by purchasing all-in-one sets and multi-
tools. The Topeak Alien range features three incredibly robust multi-tools, each containing a
broad selection of the above tools, including Allen keys, screwdrivers, a chain tool and a
Torx wrench. Their size and mobility make them an invaluable tool for any cyclist.

Muc-Off, the official supplier of bike care products to Team Sky, have a range of bicycle
cleaning products, such as de-greaser, chain cleaner and wet lube. They also offer complete
cleaning kits, which contain all the necessary oils, lubricants and brushes to keep youyour
bike running in tiptop shape.

If you plan on keeping up the maintenance, it may be worth purchasing a bike stand for
support and a chain checker, such as this stainless steel tool from Icetoolz, in order to
monitor whether or not your chain has stretched.

Washing Your Bike

Cleaning is a big part of keeping your bike running properly. Whilst some may treat it like a
chore and groan at the thought of having to give their cycle a scrub down, it’s still an
essential part of the maintenance process.

You don’t have to meticulously clean out every nook and cranny, but by rinsing, washing
and applying lube to your bike you’ll ensure you extend its lifespan leaving with you with a
great looking piece of kit when you’re finished, so that’s always a plus.

You should never put a dirty bike away, so if you’ve been on a long ride and have come
back coated in mud, be prepared to pull out the hose and get scrubbing.

First things first, give your bike a light all-over rinse in order to remove any debris or excess
dirt; if you jump straight in and start scrubbing then you’ll only end up spreading the grit
and scratching your frame.

Once you’ve given it a good rinse, prop the bike against the stand (or whatever you’re using
to hold it up), grab a sponge, fill up a bucket with warm soapy water and give your cycle a
good thorough wash. Use the brush to remove any stubborn areas of dirt, being extra
careful not to leave any scratches.

Give your bike another quick rinse to remove all the soap suds,  then use the cloth to dry
everything thoroughly.

Once everything has dried out, spray both wheels and the bike with your chosen degreaser
and let that soak in for a minute.

The Complete Guide To Servicing Your Road Bike

Many people like to wax or polish their bike straight after washing it. It’s a great way to
keep the cycle looking great and ensure that dirt doesn’t stick as easily, but too much can
cause unnecessary build-up. In reality you only need to apply a new coating once every
three or four washes.

Maintaining Your Bike

We live in a culture where shopping is as easy as taking out your mobile and pressing a few
buttons, so it’s no surprise that some people prefer to purchase brand new bike parts
instead of properly maintaining and restoring the old components of their bicycle.

However, with just a few simple checks, and a little bit of elbow grease, you can save
yourself a whole lot of money and extend the life expectancy of your transport.

We’ve provided several tips for the proper upkeep of each part; use the quick links below to
find the relative to the information you’re looking for:

  Handlebars
  Seating
  Frame
  Drivetrain

The Complete Guide To Servicing Your Road Bike

  Chain
  Brakes
  Tyres

Handlebars

Stem: If your handlebars are constantly squeaking, loosen the bolts (or top cap if you’re
using a threadless stem) holding the stem in place and slide the bar out. Wipe the
previously clamped area with a few drops of cycle oil and place everything back in its
rightful place, tightening accordingly.

On a separate note it’s recommended that you check for any loose bolts at least once a
month.

Tape: Is the tape around your handlebars coming loose, or looking a little worse for wear?
If you have the right kind of tape to hand (available here), it can easily be replaced.

Pop the end plug off and unwrap/cut away any old tape. It’s also worth cleaning the
handlebar thoroughly now in order to remove any excess glue. Once clean, begin wrapping
the tape around the bars in the direction that your hands roll on the drops.  If your hands
wind to the outside wrap clockwise on the right and counter-clockwise on the left, and vice-
a-versa if they roll to the inside. When it comes to the flat section, always wind toward the
saddle.

Seating

Saddle: Your saddle can take a lot of wear and tear over time, so if it’s looking a bit worn it
may be worth buffing it up. If you have an authentic leather saddle, don’t be afraid to
restore it using shoe polish, just be sure to buffer it properly before riding again, as you will
not want to stain  your cycling gear.

A good polish will also help your saddle withstand the weather, although it’s definitely worth
keeping it covered (a simple plastic bag will do the job) when not in use.

Post: Make sure you clean and grease your seat post just as regularly as the rest of your
bike. When it comes to keeping your seat at the right height, use a small piece of masking
tape or a permanent marker pen to highlight the correct position.

When checking your post, be sure to look for any rust around the collar. These are relatively
inexpensive to replace, and it will save you a lot of hassle later down the line if you do it
now.

6

The Complete Guide To Servicing Your Road Bike

Frame

Your frame is the central hub of your bike. It holds everything in place, and should be taken
care of accordingly.

Check regularly for any rust or wear and tear by removing your wheels and giving it a full
inspection. When it comes to keeping it in pristine condition, be sure to rinse, wash, rinse
again, dry it off, lube, adjust and wax thoroughly.

Drivetrain

Your drivetrain is the conduit that keeps your wheels turning; maintaining it properly will
make life a lot easier.

Oiling the bottom bracket’s cable guide at least once a week (or straight after a ride in the
rain) will prevent it from getting too gummed up.

To ensure a silent ride, put a few drips of oil into the derailleur pulley wheel hubs as well.

Chain

Length: Use the chain checker to measure whether or not your chain needs to be replaced.
24 chain links can stretch to 12.2 inches rivet to rivet before needing to be replaced.

Skipping: If your chain is constantly skipping, turn your derailleur’s barrel adjuster by half.
Turn it clockwise if the chain drops to a smaller cog and counter-clockwise if it jumps up to
a larger one. If it’s still skipping you can try turning it by another half, but don’t tighten it
too far.

Oiling: You should only lubricate between the side plates and under the centre roller of
your chain; coating the entire chain serves no purpose other than to create a mess.

Once the chain is sufficiently oiled, let it properly soak in for a few minutes before wiping
the whole thing down again to remove any excess gunk; then continue to  wipe it clean
after every ride. You only need to apply lube again once the chain starts squeaking.

Brakes

Disc Pads: Measure the thickness of your disc pads to ensure they work properly. Road
disc pads should be no thinner than 2.5mm before needing to be replaced.

We stock a wide range of quality road bike brake pads; Click here to browse our selection.

Cables: Put a cap on any freshly cut cables to stop yourself from cutting up your hands.

The Complete Guide To Servicing Your Road Bike

Tyres

Sealant: If you use tubeless tyres, the sealant securing them will eventually dry out. To
keep your tyres in the best condition this should be removed and reapplied once every two
months.

Inflation: Tyre pressure is an acute aspect of how well your bike will handle. If the tyres
are under inflated, you’ll be riding on flats and wasting energy. Pump up your tyres too
much and you risk them bursting as they’re more prone to damage.

The maximum compression will be printed on the sidewall of your tyre; use a pressure
gauge to ensure you’re not inflating it all the way, checking it at least once a month to make
sure it never drops too low.

Tread: Check your tyre treads frequently to be sure that they have not worn too thin. A tell-
tale sign is that the surface of summer tyres, which have no tread, will begin to flatten when
they wear.

Mudguard: Investing in both a back and front mudguard will help keep you relatively
splatter free when riding in the rain.

The above is just a brief guide on how to properly look after your road bike; but it’ll certainly
help you with getting started. There’s always more you can do to ensure your bike stays in
its best condition, so for all your biking needs, including a wide range of cleaning products

Security Patching Simplified To The Extreme

### Writing a 0patch for Acrobat Reader's Use-After-Free Vulnerability CVE-2016-1077

This blog post will describe how we created a 0patch for CVE-2016-1077, a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe's Acrobat Reader DC version 15.010.20060 for Windows.

According to [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB16-14](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb16-14.html), this vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Pier-Luc Maltais of COSIG, and shortly after the release of this bulletin, a [proof-of-concept exploit](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/137035/Adobe-Reader-DC-15.010.20060-Memory-Corruption.html) was published on Packet Storm. This *PoC* is in the form of a PDF document that crashes the Reader when opened. (By the way, it was apparently created with single-byte raw file fuzzing; we were able to compare it to the original PDF file we found on the Internet.)

This was enough for us to start analyzing the vulnerability. To keep this blog post reasonably short, we will omit the vulnerability analysis process, which is nicely described in [this detailed post](https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/06/06/analysis-of-use-after-free-vulnerability-cve-2016-4119-in-adobe-acrobat-and-reader) by Fortinet's Kai Lu and Kushal Arvind Shah for another identical vulnerability in the very same function as ours.

So let's fast-forward to the point where we know exactly what the flaw is. We have a use-after-free issue, as shown in the vulnerable code below.

|  |
| --- |
| Vulnerable code: after freeing an object, reference to this object is not removed |

The above image shows three relevant code blocks somewhere in Acrobat Reader's implementation of *deflate* operation on an XObject (an element in a PDF document), where the code is obviously doing some clean-up by freeing an object it no longer needs. The pointer to this object is retrieved in register ecx, then the test ecx, ecx instruction effectively checks if the pointer is NULL, and this determines whether the execution will continue on the red branch (ecx not NULL) or the green branch (ecx is NULL). In the red branch, pointer to object's free function is copied from object's *vtable* (free is the first function in *vtable* in this case) to register eax, then a call to free is made.

The relevant code can be represented by this simple pseudo-code:

ObjectA\* a; // stored in edi register

ObjectB\* b; // stored in eax register

ObjectC\* c; // stored in ecx register

...

b = a->some\_objectB;

c = b->some\_objectC;

if (c) // the red branch

  delete c;

...

Note that after c is deleted, its reference (pointer to it) in b->some\_objectC is not removed. And sure enough, at some point later in the execution, b->some\_objectC  is accessed again. But this time c points to an already deallocated memory address, and access violation occurs.

Now let's see how we would fix the above pseudo-code. It's trivial, we only need to write NULL to b->some\_objectC after deleting c:

...

b = a->some\_objectB;

c = b->some\_objectC;

if (c)

  delete c;

**b->some\_objectC = NULL; // destroy reference to deleted object**

...

So we have a pseudo-code patch, now let's translate it to machine code. First look at the vulnerable code in a "text" view:

6056E274 8B 47 38           mov   eax, [edi+38h]
6056E277 C6 45 FC 0B        mov   byte ptr [ebp+var\_4], 0Bh
6056E27B 89 88 C8 00 00 00  mov   [eax+0C8h], ecx
6056E281 8B 4F 3C           mov   ecx, [edi+3Ch]
6056E284 E8 46 07 00 00     call  sub\_6056E9CF
6056E289 8B 47 3C           mov   eax, [edi+3Ch]  ; edi points to some object, eax is pointer to

                                                    a member object
6056E28C 8B 88 C8 00 00 00  mov   ecx, [eax+0C8h] ; ecx is pointer to an object member from the

                                                    "eax" object
6056E292 85 C9              test  ecx, ecx        ; Is this pointer NULL?
6056E294 74 05              jz    short loc\_6056E29B ; If it's NULL, we don't have to free it

6056E296 8B 01              mov   eax, [ecx]      ; Get the address of function "free" from

                                                    object's vtable
6056E298 56                 push  esi             ; esi = 1
6056E299 FF 10              call  dword ptr [eax] ; call "free" for this object

6056E29B    loc\_6056E29B:                           ; CODE XREF: sub\_6056DC50+644 j
6056E29B 56                 push  esi             ; the reference to freed object is not removed

                                                    (CVE-2016-1077)
6056E29C 6A 24              push  24h
6056E29E E8 71 B6 AD FF     call  sub\_60049914

6056E2A3 59                 pop   ecx
6056E2A4 59                 pop   ecx

The patch code must come after call dword ptr [eax], which is a call to object's free. We need the address where the pointer to the object is stored, so we can put a NULL there.This address was [edi+3Ch]+C8h just a few instructions earlier, and we know edi is not corrupted by the call to free as it is still being used later in the code without being assigned a new value. (This is easy to check with IDA as it highlights all uses of a register when you click on one.)

When creating a micropatch, we need to be careful about a few things:

1. Injecting a micropatch works by overwriting one or more existing instructions with a 5-byte JMP instruction to some nearby-allocated memory block, where the overwritten instructions are added at the end of our patch code, followed by a JMP back to the place in the original code right after them. Of the overwritten instructions, the first one may be a destination point of some CALL or JMP, but others may not be, as that would certainly lead to an error in execution. Fortunately, IDA makes it really easy to verify this with its graphical representation of code.
2. We should not cause any unwanted side-effects, like corrupting values of registers or stack-based variables that subsequent code may still be using. When in doubt, we should PUSH/POP the registers we use or otherwise preserve them.
3. We should not merely *assume* that a register value will survive a function call (e.g., that edi will survive a call to free in our case) - we must *prove* it by either reviewing this function (and all functions it calls etc.) and showing that the value is reliably preserved, or showing that the original code after the function call relies on the fact that the register hasn't changed.
4. Our code should be as easy as possible to review. On one hand, this means using as few instructions as possible, and on the other hand it means making it easy for a reviewer to verify our claims upon which the patch code is constructed (e.g., that "patch code can safely change eax because...", or "at this point, edx will always point to..."). Sometimes, these goals are in contradiction: for example, in our patch code below, we could simply use eax instead of edi and avoid having to PUSH/POP edi, but it would make code review harder.

First, let's find a suitable location for our patch. There's an obvious candidate immediately after  call dword ptr [eax] at location 6056E29B (AcroRd32.dll + 0x56E29B). The instructions there are:

6056E29B 56                 push  esi

6056E29C 6A 24              push  24h
6056E29E E8 71 B6 AD FF     call  sub\_60049914

Remember, we need 5 bytes for our "JMP to patch", so we'll have to relocate all these three instructions to the space right after our patch code. Note that the third instruction is a relative CALL, which means that its offset has to be recalculated when it is moved. (Don't worry, 0patch agent does this automatically.)

As for the patch code, let's try this:

push edi                   ; store edi as subsequent code still needs it
mov edi, dword[edi+03ch]   ; edi = pointer to object b in pseudo code
mov dword[edi+0c8h], 0h    ; set pointer to object c to NULL
pop edi                    ; restore edi

This code just uses a single register (edi), making it trivial for a reviewer to see that it has no side effects while writing a NULL where the original code forgot to do it. As already noted, we could make it even shorter if we used eax instead of edi, as we wouldn't have to preserve eax's value. However, *proving* that we don't have to preserve eax's value would require reviewing quite some additional code after our patch location, including a function that is called there. This would consume patch developer's as well as patch reviewer's time, and increase the risk of error for both of them.

One last check: Can we be absolutely sure that edi will point to the same object a at address 6056E29B as it did a couple of instructions back at address 6056E289? There are two execution paths between these two addresses (as IDA nicely shows). One goes through the aforementioned green branch, and the other goes through the red branch. The "green branch" path is easy to prove: there is simply no instruction there that would change edi, so it must still have the same value at the end. The "red branch" path, however, includes a call to free from object's vtable. Proving that this function does not alter edi could be a daunting task, especially as IDA can't show you where the code behind this dynamically-set free is. (In fact, this function could be different for various types of objects being processed here, and only the original developers of this code know what objects that could possibly be.) So we'll use another approach: we look at the code after our patch location to see whether it relies on edi being the same as before. And in fact, we can see that it does (but that's beyond the scope of this article).

We have all we need, but how do we turn this into an actual 0patch? We use *0patch Factory*. 0patch Factory is a simple tool we wrote, which takes a *0patch source file* as input, and turns it into a 0patch that can be immediately applied on any computer with our 0patch Agent. Let's take a look at a 0patch source file for this micropatch:

MODULE\_PATH "C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat Reader DC\Reader\AcroRd32.dll"
PATCH\_ID 245
PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER 2
VULN\_ID 1272
PLATFORM win32

patchlet\_start
PATCHLET\_ID 1
PATCHLET\_TYPE 2

PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x56e29b
N\_ORIGINALBYTES 5

code\_start

    push edi
    mov edi, dword[edi+03ch]
    mov dword[edi+0c8h], 0h
    pop edi

code\_end
patchlet\_end

Some explanation is probably in order:

* Each 0patch consists of one or more *patchlets*; a patchlet is a set of machine code instructions that are to be injected at a specific offset from the module's base.
* MODULE\_PATH is full path to the module (binary file) we're patching. 0patch Factory needs this for two reasons: (1) calculating the module's hash, as the patch should only be applied to this *exact* binary, and (2) extracting the original bytes from all locations where we're injecting our patchlets, as any patchlet should only be applied when the bytes found in the "live" module on its injection location exactly match these original bytes.
* PATCH\_ID is a unique ID of the patch in the 0patch database. It can be arbitrary during patch development, but a patch will get a suitable unique ID before it gets signed and uploaded to the server.
* PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER is the version of the format in which the patch is written. 2 is the only supported value at this time.
* VULN\_ID is the ID of the vulnerability (in the 0patch database) fixed by this patch.
* PLATFORM is either Win32 or Win64 at this time, specifying the format of machine code in this patch's patchlets. Acrobat Reader DC we're patching here is a 32-bit application.
* patchlet\_start and patchlet\_end mark beginning and end of an individual patchlet.
* PATCHLET\_ID is a unique ID of a patchlet inside a patch, usually iterative from 1 upwards.
* PATCHLET\_TYPE is the type of the patchlet, currently the only supported type is type 2 (which means "code injection patchlet"). In the future, we'll support other types of patchlets.
* PATCHLET\_OFFSET is the offset from the module's base where the patchlet code should be injected. In our case, this offset is 0x56e29b.
* N\_ORIGINALBYTES is the number of original bytes that we should check when applying the patchlet. The default is 5, which means all 5 bytes that we will overwrite with the "JMP to patch" instruction.
* code\_start and code\_end mark beginning and end of patchlet's code, which will be compiled to binary code by 0patch Factory.

We store this 0patch source file in ZP-245.0pp and build the patch using 0patch Factory on a computer with 0patch Agent installed:

|  |
| --- |
| 0patch Factory makes it easy to build a micropatch: just  right-click a *0pp* file and select "Build Patch" |

This both compiles and installs the new 0patch, making it ready for immediate application to a running vulnerable Acrobat Reader. Without further ado, let's open POC\_ZP-245.pdf to test our patch.

|  |
| --- |
| 0patch Agent notifies you that patch 245 just got applied to the running Acrobat Reader |

Acrobat Reader gets launched, the "Patch Applied" pop-up is shown notifying us that patch 245 was applied to  AcroRd32.exe, and... no crash. The document seems to be displayed correctly. We scroll down and get the "A drawing error occurred." error message from the Reader, but this is expected, as there is still a corrupt graphical element in the PDF document, and Reader correctly notifies us about that. (Latest version of Reader also shows this message.) We can continue to use Acrobat Reader as if nothing has happened.

There you go, we've just created a simple micropatch for a remotely executable memory corruption vulnerability. It consists of just four machine code instructions and can be instantaneously applied to a running Acrobat Reader while a user is reading some document with it.

Should you like to experiment with this micropatch on your own, [create a free 0patch account](https://dist.0patch.com/User/Register) and [download 0patch Agent for Windows](https://dist.0patch.com/download/latestagent) if you haven't already. (If you have, than patch ZP-245 has probably already been downloaded by your agent and is waiting for you to run the vulnerable Acrobat Reader.)

|  |
| --- |
| Patch 245 is now in the "Patches" list in the 0patch Console, where you can enable or disable it |

Once you have 0patch Agent installed and registered, install [Acrobat Reader DC 15.010.20060](http://ardownload.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/AcrobatDC/1501020060/AcroRdrDC1501020060_en_US.exe) and use it to open [POC\_ZP-245.pdf](https://0patch.com/poc/CVE-2016-1077/POC_ZP-245.pdf), first with patch 245 enabled, and then disabled. Notice the difference? ;)

If you'd like to write your own 0patches, and we sure hope many of you would, give us some time to polish our *0patch Factory* for you. It's nothing fancy, but you deserve a decently tested tool with useful instructions. In the mean time, please send us an email at crowdpatching@0patch.com to express your interest.

*[Télécharger](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)*

## Vous avez des questions? Nous avons des réponses!

**Qu'est-ce qu'Adobe Acrobat Reader?**

Adobe Acrobat Reader est l'application gratuite de référence pour consulter, imprimer, signer, partager et annoter des fichiers PDF. Il s'agit de la seule application de visualisation de fichiers PDF capable d'ouvrir tous types de contenus PDF, y compris des formulaires et des fichiers multimédias, et d'interagir avec ces éléments. Il est désormais connecté aux services Adobe Document Nuage afin que vous puissiez utiliser des PDF  sur n'importe quel appareil, où que vous soyez.

**L'application Acrobat Reader est-elle gratuite?**

Oui, Acrobat Reader est une application pour ordinateur gratuite, disponible sur la [page de téléchargement Reader](https://get.adobe.com/fr/reader/) ou lorsque vous voyez une icône pour télécharger Adobe Acrobat Reader.

**Comment télécharger les applications Acrobat Reader gratuites pour ordinateur et appareils mobiles?**

Vous pouvez facilement télécharger les applications Adobe Acrobat Reader gratuites pour plusieurs systèmes d'exploitation et appareils :

**Application de bureau**  : accédez à la[page de téléchargement d'Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/fr/reader/) pour obtenir Reader pour votre ordinateur. Vous pouvez sélectionner votre langue, votre système d'exploitation et la vitesse de votre connexion.

**Application mobile**  : pour télécharger cette application, rendez-vous sur [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader#_blank) ou le [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/adobe-reader/id469337564?mt=8#_blank). Vous pouvez également télécharger la dernière version de l'application mobile pour les téléphones [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=134e363e-8811-44be-b1e3-d8a0c60d4692#_blank).

**Dois-je disposer d'Acrobat Pro ou d'Acrobat Standard pour pouvoir utiliser l'application Acrobat Reader gratuite?**

Non, Acrobat Reader est une application autonome gratuite que vous pouvez utiliser pour ouvrir, visualiser, signer, imprimer, annoter, parcourir et partager des fichiers PDF. Acrobat Pro et Acrobat Standard sont des produits payants qui font partie de la même famille. Pour connaître leurs différences, consultez le [comparatif des produits Acrobat](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pricing/compare-versions.html).

**Quels sont les systèmes d'exploitation pour ordinateur compatibles avec Acrobat Reader?**

L'application Acrobat Reader pour ordinateur s'exécute sur les systèmes d'exploitation Windows et Mac. [Téléchargez l'application Reader pour ordinateur](https://get.adobe.com/fr/reader/) ou consultez la [configuration système requise](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/system-requirements.html).

**Quelles langues sont prises en charge par Acrobat Reader?**

Pour en savoir plus sur les langues prises en charge, rendez-vous sur la page de la [configuration système requise](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/system-requirements.html).

**Acrobat Reader est-il accessible sur les appareils mobiles?**

À l'instar de Reader pour ordinateur, Acrobat Reader pour appareils mobiles est une application gratuite qui offre un environnement particulièrement fiable pour visualiser et manipuler des PDF..  Avec l'ajout des services Adobe Document Nuage, vous avez désormais accès aux fonctionnalités premium de votre application et pouvez aller plus loin en souscrivant un abonnement à [Adobe Acrobat PDF Ensemble](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pdf-pack-pricing.html), à [Adobe Acrobat Export PDF](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/export-pdf-online-pricing.html) ou à [Adobe Acrobat Pro](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/acrobat-pro.html).

Pour obtenir les versions Android et iOS, rendez-vous respectivement sur [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader#_blank) ou le [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/adobe-reader/id469337564?mt=8#_blank). Vous pouvez également télécharger la dernière version de l'application mobile pour les téléphones [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=134e363e-8811-44be-b1e3-d8a0c60d4692#_blank).

**Quels sont les outils de commentaire disponibles dans Acrobat Reader?**

Reader permet d'annoter facilement des documents PDF. Avec Reader sur votre ordinateur, vous pouvez effectuer les tâches suivantes : annoter des fichiers PDF à l'aide de notes, saisir du texte directement dans la page, utiliser les outils pour surligner, souligner ou barrer le texte et effectuer des dessins sur l'écran à l'aide des outils de dessin à main levée. Les mêmes outils de commentaire sont disponibles dans Acrobat Reader pour appareils mobiles.

**Puis-je remplir et enregistrer des formulaires dans Acrobat Reader?**

Oui. L'outil Remplir et signer intégré détermine automatiquement si le formulaire PDF contient des champs à remplir. Il permet en outre de remplir rapidement et facilement le formulaire de manière intuitive, grâce à la technologie Adobe Sensei. Avec un formulaire à remplir, vous pouvez facilement saisir vos réponses ou les sélectionner dans des listes déroulantes, puis enregistrer le formulaire rempli. Lorsque vous utilisez des formulaires PDF simples qui n'ont pas été optimisés avec des champs de formulaire, vous pouvez cliquer n'importe où et saisir directement les réponses dans le formulaire (ou vous pouvez accepter les suggestions de vos entrées personnelles de remplissage automatique). Lorsque vous avez terminé, vous pouvez enregistrer vos modifications et envoyer le formulaire complété à d'autres personnes.

À l'aide de l'application mobile Adobe Acrobat Reader, vous pouvez effectuer les mêmes tâches sur un appareil iOS ou Android. Vous pouvez télécharger l'application mobile Adobe Acrobat Reader sur [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader#_blank) ou le [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id950099951#_blank).

**Puis-je signer électroniquement des documents et des formulaires à l'aide d'Acrobat Reader?**

Oui, l'outil Remplir et signer optimisé par Adobe Acrobat Sign facilite la signature de documents et de formulaires. Il suffit d'ouvrir un fichier PDF et de le signer en insérant une image ou bien en saisissant ou en traçant votre signature.

À l'aide de l'application mobile Adobe Acrobat Reader, vous pouvez effectuer les mêmes tâches sur un appareil iOS ou Android. Vous pouvez télécharger l'application mobile Adobe Acrobat Reader sur [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader#_blank) ou le [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id950099951#_blank). Vous pouvez également remplir des formulaires et les signer dans votre navigateur Web.

**Puis-je recueillir des signatures et gérer des documents signés dans Acrobat Reader?**

Oui, avec Acrobat Reader, le nombre de signatures que vous pouvez demander à l'aide de l'outil Remplir et signer est limité si vous ne souscrivez pas un abonnement à Acrobat Pro, à Adobe Acrobat PDF Ensemble ou à Adobe Acrobat Sign. Si vous dépassez le nombre autorisé de transactions de signature gratuites, vous pouvez vous abonner à l'une des solutions Document Nuage pour pouvoir solliciter plus de signatures.

La clientèle actuelle d'Acrobat Sign peut utiliser l'application mobile Acrobat Sign pour effectuer la même opération sur Android ou iOS. Pour télécharger gratuitement l'application, rendez-vous sur [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.echosign#_blank) ou le [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id481082197#_blank). Vous pouvez également envoyer des documents pour signature dans votre navigateur Web.

**Puis-je modifier des PDF à l'aide d'Acrobat Reader?**

Non. Avec Acrobat Reader, vous ne pouvez pas apporter de modifications permanentes à du texte ou des images d'un fichier PDF. Pour modifier des PDF,  abonnez-vous à l'application [Adobe Acrobat](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pricing.html). Si vous avez souscrit un abonnement à Adobe Acrobat, vous pouvez également modifier les PDF dans l'application mobile Adobe Acrobat Reader.

**Qu'est-ce que le mode protégé?**

Pour interdire l'utilisation du format PDF par du code malveillant tentant d'effectuer des opérations en écriture ou en lecture dans le système de fichiers de l'ordinateur, Adobe propose un mode protégé mettant en œuvre la technologie « sandbox ». Activé par défaut dans Acrobat Reader, le mode protégé sécurise votre ordinateur contre les logiciels malveillants et empêche les personnes malintentionnées d'accéder aux données importantes et de les extraire sur votre ordinateur ou sur votre réseau d'entreprise.

**Comment contrôler l'accès à l'information importante?**

Les paramètres de protection et les droits d'accès d'un fichier PDF ne peuvent pas être définis dans Reader. Ils peuvent toutefois l'être dans le logiciel Adobe Acrobat. Grâce aux paramètres de protection, il est possible de spécifier qui peut ouvrir, consulter, imprimer, copier ou modifier un document. Ces fonctionnalités permettent aux entreprises de protéger leur information confidentielles. Avec des privilèges d'accès, les auteurs et les autrices peuvent définir un mot de passe d'ouverture d'un document et utiliser un ID de certificat pour chiffrer un document afin que les destinataires puissent l'ouvrir en saisissant leur propre ID de certificat unique.

**Les services Adobe Document Nuage sont-ils sécurisés?**

Oui, les pratiques de sécurité sont profondément ancrées dans la culture d'Adobe, ainsi que dans les processus du développement logiciel et des opérations de service. Qu'il s'agisse de la gestion des identités, de la confidentialité des données ou de l'intégrité des documents, les services Adobe Document Nuage font appel à des pratiques de sécurité de pointe pour protéger au maximum les documents, les données et l'information à caractère personnel. Pour en savoir plus sur les pratiques de sécurité de l'entreprise, le cycle de vie sécurisé des produits Adobe ou la sécurité de la solution Adobe Document Cloud, reportez-vous à la page [Sécurité](https://www.adobe.com/security.html) sur adobe.com.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Writing a 0patch for Acrobat Reader's Use-After-Free Vulnerability CVE-2016-1077

This blog post will describe how we created a 0patch for CVE-2016-1077, a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe's Acrobat Reader DC version 15.010.20060 for Windows.

According to [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB16-14](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb16-14.html), this vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Pier-Luc Maltais of COSIG, and shortly after the release of this bulletin, a [proof-of-concept exploit](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/137035/Adobe-Reader-DC-15.010.20060-Memory-Corruption.html) was published on Packet Storm. This *PoC* is in the form of a PDF document that crashes the Reader when opened. (By the way, it was apparently created with single-byte raw file fuzzing; we were able to compare it to the original PDF file we found on the Internet.)

This was enough for us to start analyzing the vulnerability. To keep this blog post reasonably short, we will omit the vulnerability analysis process, which is nicely described in [this detailed post](https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/06/06/analysis-of-use-after-free-vulnerability-cve-2016-4119-in-adobe-acrobat-and-reader) by Fortinet's Kai Lu and Kushal Arvind Shah for another identical vulnerability in the very same function as ours.

So let's fast-forward to the point where we know exactly what the flaw is. We have a use-after-free issue, as shown in the vulnerable code below.

|  |
| --- |
| Vulnerable code: after freeing an object, reference to this object is not removed |

The above image shows three relevant code blocks somewhere in Acrobat Reader's implementation of *deflate* operation on an XObject (an element in a PDF document), where the code is obviously doing some clean-up by freeing an object it no longer needs. The pointer to this object is retrieved in register ecx, then the test ecx, ecx instruction effectively checks if the pointer is NULL, and this determines whether the execution will continue on the red branch (ecx not NULL) or the green branch (ecx is NULL). In the red branch, pointer to object's free function is copied from object's *vtable* (free is the first function in *vtable* in this case) to register eax, then a call to free is made.

The relevant code can be represented by this simple pseudo-code:

ObjectA\* a; // stored in edi register

ObjectB\* b; // stored in eax register

ObjectC\* c; // stored in ecx register

...

b = a->some\_objectB;

c = b->some\_objectC;

if (c) // the red branch

  delete c;

...

Note that after c is deleted, its reference (pointer to it) in b->some\_objectC is not removed. And sure enough, at some point later in the execution, b->some\_objectC  is accessed again. But this time c points to an already deallocated memory address, and access violation occurs.

Now let's see how we would fix the above pseudo-code. It's trivial, we only need to write NULL to b->some\_objectC after deleting c:

...

b = a->some\_objectB;

c = b->some\_objectC;

if (c)

  delete c;

**b->some\_objectC = NULL; // destroy reference to deleted object**

...

So we have a pseudo-code patch, now let's translate it to machine code. First look at the vulnerable code in a "text" view:

6056E274 8B 47 38           mov   eax, [edi+38h]
6056E277 C6 45 FC 0B        mov   byte ptr [ebp+var\_4], 0Bh
6056E27B 89 88 C8 00 00 00  mov   [eax+0C8h], ecx
6056E281 8B 4F 3C           mov   ecx, [edi+3Ch]
6056E284 E8 46 07 00 00     call  sub\_6056E9CF
6056E289 8B 47 3C           mov   eax, [edi+3Ch]  ; edi points to some object, eax is pointer to

                                                    a member object
6056E28C 8B 88 C8 00 00 00  mov   ecx, [eax+0C8h] ; ecx is pointer to an object member from the

                                                    "eax" object
6056E292 85 C9              test  ecx, ecx        ; Is this pointer NULL?
6056E294 74 05              jz    short loc\_6056E29B ; If it's NULL, we don't have to free it

6056E296 8B 01              mov   eax, [ecx]      ; Get the address of function "free" from

                                                    object's vtable
6056E298 56                 push  esi             ; esi = 1
6056E299 FF 10              call  dword ptr [eax] ; call "free" for this object

6056E29B    loc\_6056E29B:                           ; CODE XREF: sub\_6056DC50+644 j
6056E29B 56                 push  esi             ; the reference to freed object is not removed

                                                    (CVE-2016-1077)
6056E29C 6A 24              push  24h
6056E29E E8 71 B6 AD FF     call  sub\_60049914

6056E2A3 59                 pop   ecx
6056E2A4 59                 pop   ecx

The patch code must come after call dword ptr [eax], which is a call to object's free. We need the address where the pointer to the object is stored, so we can put a NULL there.This address was [edi+3Ch]+C8h just a few instructions earlier, and we know edi is not corrupted by the call to free as it is still being used later in the code without being assigned a new value. (This is easy to check with IDA as it highlights all uses of a register when you click on one.)

When creating a micropatch, we need to be careful about a few things:

1. Injecting a micropatch works by overwriting one or more existing instructions with a 5-byte JMP instruction to some nearby-allocated memory block, where the overwritten instructions are added at the end of our patch code, followed by a JMP back to the place in the original code right after them. Of the overwritten instructions, the first one may be a destination point of some CALL or JMP, but others may not be, as that would certainly lead to an error in execution. Fortunately, IDA makes it really easy to verify this with its graphical representation of code.
2. We should not cause any unwanted side-effects, like corrupting values of registers or stack-based variables that subsequent code may still be using. When in doubt, we should PUSH/POP the registers we use or otherwise preserve them.
3. We should not merely *assume* that a register value will survive a function call (e.g., that edi will survive a call to free in our case) - we must *prove* it by either reviewing this function (and all functions it calls etc.) and showing that the value is reliably preserved, or showing that the original code after the function call relies on the fact that the register hasn't changed.
4. Our code should be as easy as possible to review. On one hand, this means using as few instructions as possible, and on the other hand it means making it easy for a reviewer to verify our claims upon which the patch code is constructed (e.g., that "patch code can safely change eax because...", or "at this point, edx will always point to..."). Sometimes, these goals are in contradiction: for example, in our patch code below, we could simply use eax instead of edi and avoid having to PUSH/POP edi, but it would make code review harder.

First, let's find a suitable location for our patch. There's an obvious candidate immediately after  call dword ptr [eax] at location 6056E29B (AcroRd32.dll + 0x56E29B). The instructions there are:

6056E29B 56                 push  esi

6056E29C 6A 24              push  24h
6056E29E E8 71 B6 AD FF     call  sub\_60049914

Remember, we need 5 bytes for our "JMP to patch", so we'll have to relocate all these three instructions to the space right after our patch code. Note that the third instruction is a relative CALL, which means that its offset has to be recalculated when it is moved. (Don't worry, 0patch agent does this automatically.)

As for the patch code, let's try this:

push edi                   ; store edi as subsequent code still needs it
mov edi, dword[edi+03ch]   ; edi = pointer to object b in pseudo code
mov dword[edi+0c8h], 0h    ; set pointer to object c to NULL
pop edi                    ; restore edi

This code just uses a single register (edi), making it trivial for a reviewer to see that it has no side effects while writing a NULL where the original code forgot to do it. As already noted, we could make it even shorter if we used eax instead of edi, as we wouldn't have to preserve eax's value. However, *proving* that we don't have to preserve eax's value would require reviewing quite some additional code after our patch location, including a function that is called there. This would consume patch developer's as well as patch reviewer's time, and increase the risk of error for both of them.

One last check: Can we be absolutely sure that edi will point to the same object a at address 6056E29B as it did a couple of instructions back at address 6056E289? There are two execution paths between these two addresses (as IDA nicely shows). One goes through the aforementioned green branch, and the other goes through the red branch. The "green branch" path is easy to prove: there is simply no instruction there that would change edi, so it must still have the same value at the end. The "red branch" path, however, includes a call to free from object's vtable. Proving that this function does not alter edi could be a daunting task, especially as IDA can't show you where the code behind this dynamically-set free is. (In fact, this function could be different for various types of objects being processed here, and only the original developers of this code know what objects that could possibly be.) So we'll use another approach: we look at the code after our patch location to see whether it relies on edi being the same as before. And in fact, we can see that it does (but that's beyond the scope of this article).

We have all we need, but how do we turn this into an actual 0patch? We use *0patch Factory*. 0patch Factory is a simple tool we wrote, which takes a *0patch source file* as input, and turns it into a 0patch that can be immediately applied on any computer with our 0patch Agent. Let's take a look at a 0patch source file for this micropatch:

MODULE\_PATH "C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat Reader DC\Reader\AcroRd32.dll"
PATCH\_ID 245
PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER 2
VULN\_ID 1272
PLATFORM win32

patchlet\_start
PATCHLET\_ID 1
PATCHLET\_TYPE 2

PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x56e29b
N\_ORIGINALBYTES 5

code\_start

    push edi
    mov edi, dword[edi+03ch]
    mov dword[edi+0c8h], 0h
    pop edi

code\_end
patchlet\_end

Some explanation is probably in order:

* Each 0patch consists of one or more *patchlets*; a patchlet is a set of machine code instructions that are to be injected at a specific offset from the module's base.
* MODULE\_PATH is full path to the module (binary file) we're patching. 0patch Factory needs this for two reasons: (1) calculating the module's hash, as the patch should only be applied to this *exact* binary, and (2) extracting the original bytes from all locations where we're injecting our patchlets, as any patchlet should only be applied when the bytes found in the "live" module on its injection location exactly match these original bytes.
* PATCH\_ID is a unique ID of the patch in the 0patch database. It can be arbitrary during patch development, but a patch will get a suitable unique ID before it gets signed and uploaded to the server.
* PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER is the version of the format in which the patch is written. 2 is the only supported value at this time.
* VULN\_ID is the ID of the vulnerability (in the 0patch database) fixed by this patch.
* PLATFORM is either Win32 or Win64 at this time, specifying the format of machine code in this patch's patchlets. Acrobat Reader DC we're patching here is a 32-bit application.
* patchlet\_start and patchlet\_end mark beginning and end of an individual patchlet.
* PATCHLET\_ID is a unique ID of a patchlet inside a patch, usually iterative from 1 upwards.
* PATCHLET\_TYPE is the type of the patchlet, currently the only supported type is type 2 (which means "code injection patchlet"). In the future, we'll support other types of patchlets.
* PATCHLET\_OFFSET is the offset from the module's base where the patchlet code should be injected. In our case, this offset is 0x56e29b.
* N\_ORIGINALBYTES is the number of original bytes that we should check when applying the patchlet. The default is 5, which means all 5 bytes that we will overwrite with the "JMP to patch" instruction.
* code\_start and code\_end mark beginning and end of patchlet's code, which will be compiled to binary code by 0patch Factory.

We store this 0patch source file in ZP-245.0pp and build the patch using 0patch Factory on a computer with 0patch Agent installed:

|  |
| --- |
| 0patch Factory makes it easy to build a micropatch: just  right-click a *0pp* file and select "Build Patch" |

This both compiles and installs the new 0patch, making it ready for immediate application to a running vulnerable Acrobat Reader. Without further ado, let's open POC\_ZP-245.pdf to test our patch.

|  |
| --- |
| 0patch Agent notifies you that patch 245 just got applied to the running Acrobat Reader |

Acrobat Reader gets launched, the "Patch Applied" pop-up is shown notifying us that patch 245 was applied to  AcroRd32.exe, and... no crash. The document seems to be displayed correctly. We scroll down and get the "A drawing error occurred." error message from the Reader, but this is expected, as there is still a corrupt graphical element in the PDF document, and Reader correctly notifies us about that. (Latest version of Reader also shows this message.) We can continue to use Acrobat Reader as if nothing has happened.

There you go, we've just created a simple micropatch for a remotely executable memory corruption vulnerability. It consists of just four machine code instructions and can be instantaneously applied to a running Acrobat Reader while a user is reading some document with it.

Should you like to experiment with this micropatch on your own, [create a free 0patch account](https://dist.0patch.com/User/Register) and [download 0patch Agent for Windows](https://dist.0patch.com/download/latestagent) if you haven't already. (If you have, than patch ZP-245 has probably already been downloaded by your agent and is waiting for you to run the vulnerable Acrobat Reader.)

|  |
| --- |
| Patch 245 is now in the "Patches" list in the 0patch Console, where you can enable or disable it |

Once you have 0patch Agent installed and registered, install [Acrobat Reader DC 15.010.20060](http://ardownload.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/AcrobatDC/1501020060/AcroRdrDC1501020060_en_US.exe) and use it to open [POC\_ZP-245.pdf](https://0patch.com/poc/CVE-2016-1077/POC_ZP-245.pdf), first with patch 245 enabled, and then disabled. Notice the difference? ;)

If you'd like to write your own 0patches, and we sure hope many of you would, give us some time to polish our *0patch Factory* for you. It's nothing fancy, but you deserve a decently tested tool with useful instructions. In the mean time, please send us an email at crowdpatching@0patch.com to express your interest. We look forward to our collaboration in changing the way vulnerabilities are getting fixed.
