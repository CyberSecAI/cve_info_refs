Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within Adobe Acrobat Reader DC's processing of XObjects during a deflate operation.
- Specifically, after freeing a certain object (`ObjectC`), a pointer to it (`b->some_objectC`) is not set to NULL. Later, the program attempts to use this dangling pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The core issue is that memory is accessed after being freed.
- Dangling pointer: The pointer `b->some_objectC` becomes a dangling pointer after the object it refers to is deallocated.
- Lack of nullification: The failure to set the pointer to NULL after freeing the object is a critical flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution by crafting a malicious PDF that triggers the use-after-free condition.
- **Denial of Service:** The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) crashes the Adobe Reader.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted PDF document.
- **XObject Processing:** The flaw is specifically located within the processing of image XObjects and their decompression.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a PDF document that includes a malicious XObject triggering the use-after-free.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the crafted PDF in a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
- No special network position or privileges are required to trigger the exploit if the crafted PDF can be opened on a vulnerable system.
