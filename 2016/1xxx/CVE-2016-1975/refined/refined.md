    "content": "The provided content includes a description of CVE-2016-1975, along with details from Mozilla's Bugzilla and SUSE security advisories.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nA race condition in the WebRTC implementation in Mozilla Firefox related to block-level statics, specifically the static initialization of objects in multithreaded environments, was identified.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Race condition: Multiple threads can attempt to initialize the static object simultaneously.  \n- Use-after-free: This pattern is not thread-safe under compilers lacking C++11 compliance, potentially leading to use of incompletely initialized, partially-deleted, or otherwise broken objects.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Memory corruption leading to denial of service.\n- Potential for exploitation resulting in arbitrary code execution, though considered theoretical or very difficult to trigger reliably.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Remote attacker can exploit the issue through web content viewed in Firefox on Windows systems.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- Ability to entice a user to load a specially crafted web page. The user must be using Windows and have WebRTC enabled in Firefox.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The vulnerability affects Windows systems. Linux, OS X, and Android systems are not affected. \n- The vulnerability stems from a non-thread-safe implementation of local statics initialization, common in C++ before C++11.\n-  The fix involves replacing custom code with the thread-safe implementation of singletons in Mozilla's source tree.",
