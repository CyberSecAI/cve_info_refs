{
  "cve": "CVE-2016-1644",
  "description": "WebKit/Source/core/layout/LayoutObject.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.87, does not properly restrict relayout scheduling, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML document.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Chromium",
    "Oxide-qt"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper restriction of relayout scheduling in the `LayoutObject.cpp` file within the Blink rendering engine.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability, leading to a denial-of-service condition or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A crafted HTML document can be used to exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a malicious website."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open the malicious HTML document."
  },
  "patch_info": {
   "chromium_patch": "The patch modifies `LayoutObject.h` and `LayoutObject.cpp` to adjust the `markContainerChainForLayout()` signature, preventing relayout scheduling when `SubtreeLayoutScope` exists, and adds a new test case `subtree-layout-percent-height-assert.html`."
