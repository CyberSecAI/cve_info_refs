Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a double-free vulnerability in the `jas_iccattrval_destroy` function within the JasPer library. This flaw occurs because a pointer to allocated memory ('attrval') can be freed twice under specific error conditions when loading an ICC color profile from a JPEG2000 image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double-free vulnerability: Memory that is deallocated is incorrectly freed a second time when an error occurs during processing. This can corrupt memory management structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Application crash: The double free can lead to a crash of applications using the JasPer library due to memory corruption.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: The vulnerability can, under certain conditions, allow for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application, if an attacker has the ability to influence the memory layout of heap.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The vulnerability is exploitable through a malformed JPEG2000 image file.
- Malicious file:  An attacker could craft a malicious JPEG2000 file containing a specially crafted ICC color profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious JPEG2000 file to a user: An attacker would need to deliver a specially crafted JPEG2000 file to the user and convince them to open it with an application that uses the vulnerable JasPer library. This could be done through a website, email, or other means.
