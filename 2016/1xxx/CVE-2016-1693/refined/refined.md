  "ID": "CVE-2016-1693",
  "Content": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2016-1693. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability exists because the `browser/safe_browsing/srt_field_trial_win.cc` in Google Chrome does not use the HTTPS service on `dl.google.com` to download the Software Removal Tool (SRT).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe vulnerability is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) vulnerability where the download of `chrome_cleanup_tool.exe` (CCT) happens over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This makes it vulnerable to spoofing, where a malicious actor can inject their version of the file.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can spoof the `chrome_cleanup_tool.exe` file, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or further compromise of the system. This has an impact on the integrity of the system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nA network attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on an HTTP session when Chrome attempts to download the Software Removal Tool.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker must be positioned in the network path between the user and Google's servers to intercept and modify the HTTP traffic. This typically involves being on the same local network or controlling an intermediate network device. The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction beyond the user initiating the download process via Chrome."
