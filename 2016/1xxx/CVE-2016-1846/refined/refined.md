Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `nvCommandQueue::GetHandleIndex` method within the `GeForce.kext` (NVIDIA Graphics Driver) on macOS. Specifically, the method doesn't validate if a pointer at `this+0x5b8` is non-null before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is that `nvCommandQueue::GetHandleIndex` dereferences a potentially null pointer leading to a crash or control flow hijack.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition. A thread calling `nvCommandQueue::GetHandleIndex` can race with another thread calling `IOServiceClose` on the same object. `IOServiceClose` can cause the pointer at `this+0x5b8` to become NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a kernel panic, causing a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The exploit described in the provided code also remaps the NULL page as read/write to gain trivial control of the kernel RIP register.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable machine to run the provided exploit code, or similar code capable of triggering the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target macOS system.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create threads and make IOKit calls to trigger the race condition.
- The provided exploit code needs to be compiled and executed with proper permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit code provided remaps the NULL page in userspace and causes the null pointer dereference, giving the attacker kernel RIP control.
- The exploit was tested on OS X 10.11.4 (15E65) MacBookPro 10,1, and it is presumed that older versions would also be vulnerable.
- The fix is likely in the form of a null pointer check or better validation before pointer dereferencing.
- The `nvAccelerator` service with the `nvCommandQueue` type is what is being exploited.
