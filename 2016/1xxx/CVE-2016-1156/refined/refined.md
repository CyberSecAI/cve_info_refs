Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an issue in how LINE for Windows and LINE for Mac OS display the Timeline, allowing a specially crafted post to trigger a denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
- Improper handling or parsing of data within timeline posts leads to the application's abnormal termination

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The application may terminate abnormally when a user views a specially crafted timeline post. This leads to a denial of service for the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack via a specially crafted post on the LINE timeline.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to post content to a timeline that a user can view.
- Low privileges are required, meaning any user with a LINE account can potentially trigger this.
- The user interaction is required to view the timeline.
