**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a hardcoded, easily guessable password ("12345678") for the Wi-Fi hotspot created by Lenovo SHAREit for Windows when configured to receive files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Hard-coded Password [CWE-259]:** The application uses a static, predictable password, making it trivial for unauthorized users to gain access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Bypass:** An attacker can easily connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot created by the application. This allows them to gain access to the network and perform other malicious actions depending on the other vulnerabilities that are present in the SHAREit application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Proximity:** An attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the device running Lenovo SHAREit for Windows.
*   **Wi-Fi Connection:** The attacker connects to the vulnerable Wi-Fi hotspot using the hardcoded password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be within Wi-Fi range of the device running Lenovo SHAREit for Windows.
*   The attacker requires a device with Wi-Fi capabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities in the Lenovo SHAREit application, however, only the one related to the CVE-2016-1491 is analyzed.
