Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the H2O web server's redirect handler not properly sanitizing user-supplied portions of a redirect path. Specifically, it fails to encode characters such as carriage return and newline (CRLF) before using them in an HTTP redirect response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The lack of input validation on the redirect path allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the server's response by injecting CRLF characters into the URL. This technique is known as HTTP response splitting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Header Injection:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject malicious HTTP headers such as `set-cookie`.
*   **Session Fixation:** This can lead to session fixation attacks where an attacker can force a victim into using a predefined session cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request.
*   **Manipulated URL:** The attacker injects CRLF characters (e.g., `%0d%0a`) and other malicious headers directly into the URL path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be a remote user who can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No specific authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack may require a victim to click on a malicious link containing the crafted URL, although the vulnerability exists in the server's handling of the redirect.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects H2O versions 1.6.1 and earlier, and 1.7.0-beta2 and earlier, when configured to use the redirect handler.
*   The fix was implemented by URI-escaping the user-supplied portion of the redirect path.
*   The fix was released in H2O versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.0-beta3.
