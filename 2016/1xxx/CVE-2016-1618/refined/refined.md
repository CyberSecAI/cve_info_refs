  "cve": "CVE-2016-1618",
  "description": "Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.82, does not ensure that a proper cryptographicallyRandomValues random number generator is used, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors.",
  "affected_software": [
    {
      "name": "Chromium",
      "version": "48.0.2564.82",

  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a weak random number generator implementation in the Blink component of Chromium.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a weak random number generator."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms. This means security features that rely on unpredictable randomness could be weakened.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is remote, via unspecified means. It would be through a web page that is rendered in the browser."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to trick a user into visiting a website containing the malicious code."
