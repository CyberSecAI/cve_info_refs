Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1583:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The official descriptions from ubuntu.com, and suse.com directly mention "CVE-2016-1583" and describe a vulnerability related to eCryptfs attempting to use the mmap handler of a lower filesystem.
   - The git commit messages and descriptions in other sources such as github.com and openwall.com, detail how crafted mmap calls related to /proc pathnames are the root cause.
   - Thus, the provided content is related to CVE-2016-1583.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
     - The `ecryptfs_privileged_open` function in `fs/ecryptfs/kthread.c` didn't properly check if the lower filesystem (on which `ecryptfs` was stacked) had an `mmap` handler before using it.
     - Stacking a filesystem over procfs, specifically, and making crafted `mmap` calls to `/proc/$pid/environ` could trigger recursive page fault handling which could lead to a kernel stack overflow.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - Lack of validation if the lower filesystem supports `mmap`.
     - Potential for stack overflow due to deep recursion in page fault handling when mapping `/proc` pathnames.
     - Insufficient restrictions for stacking filesystems on `procfs`.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - Denial of service (system crash) due to stack memory consumption.
     - Potential for local privilege escalation if arbitrary code execution could be achieved by overwriting data on the kernel stack.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - Local unprivileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
     - Specific attack vector involves mounting ecryptfs on top of the `/proc` filesystem.
     - Then trigger the vulnerability by making crafted mmap calls to `/proc/$pid/environ`.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - Local access to the system.
     - Ability to mount filesystems (specifically, ecryptfs)
     - Can trigger `mmap` calls, possibly through a specially crafted application.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**
   - The Suse information mentions that a setuid root `mount.ecryptfs_private` binary is a prerequisite for a working exploit, and suggests deinstalling `ecryptfs-utils` as a workaround if needed.
   - The github.com source confirms the vulnerability and that the fix is to explicitly forbid mmap calls when lower filesystems do not support it, and that /proc should not have any file systems stacked on top of it.
   - The openwall.com content highlights how the eCryptfs vulnerability can lead to a stack overflow. It also highlights a related "sched: panic on corrupted stack end" patch which helps prevent a recursive oops if the stack is corrupted by the vulnerability. It also includes a link to a Project Zero issue with a working exploit.
   - The ubuntu.com USN description mentions the possibility of code execution with administrative privileges.
   - A commit message from git.kernel.org describes the vulnerability as allowing local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory consumption) via vectors involving crafted mmap calls for `/proc` pathnames, leading to recursive pagefault handling.
   - github.com advisory mentions recursive page fault handling as the cause of stack overflow. Also, the github advisory contains links to the related commits, the NVD, exploit-db and other related resources.

**4. Summarized:**
   - CVE-2016-1583 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability present in the Linux kernel's eCryptfs implementation and triggered when stacking file systems on procfs and using crafted mmap calls on `/proc` pathnames.
   - A local unprivileged attacker can trigger a recursive page fault resulting in denial of service (kernel crash). The potential for privilege escalation exists when an attacker can execute arbitrary code through overwriting the kernel stack.
   - The vulnerability is mitigated by forbidding stacking filesystems on procfs and explicit checks for `mmap` support from lower-level filesystems.
