Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the implementation of intra-process communication within Cisco UCS Invicta Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-264):** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain root privileges on the affected system. This indicates a flaw in how the software handles access control for intra-process communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete compromise of the system:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, including full access to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (as indicated by the CVSS vector: C:C/I:C/A:C).
*   **Root-level access:** The attacker gains privileges of the root user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker. This implies the vulnerable service is accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the affected system over the network.

**Additional details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 10.0, indicating the highest severity. The temporal score is 8.7, which considers exploitability, remediation level, and report confidence.
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Whiptail Racerunner
    *   Cisco UCS Invicta Scaling System and Appliance
    *   Cisco UCS Invicta C3124SA Appliance
*   **No workarounds:** There are no available workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability other than applying the software update.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco released updates to address the vulnerability in Cisco UCS Invicta Scaling System and Appliance Software versions 5.0.1.3b and later, and in Cisco UCS Invicta C3124SA Appliance Software versions 5.0.1.2c and later.
* **Exploitation:** The advisory indicates that the vulnerability is easily exploited (Exploitability: High).
