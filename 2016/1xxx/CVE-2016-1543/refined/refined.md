{
  "cve": "CVE-2016-1543",
  "extracted_data": {
    "root_cause": "The BMC Server Automation RSCD agent has a weak access control check, and it doesn't properly validate the 'Server intro' data (role and username), allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak access control",
      "Insufficient authentication validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote command execution without authentication. An attacker can change passwords for system users, enumerate users, and execute arbitrary OS commands. This can lead to complete compromise of affected systems.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send specially crafted packets to the RSCD agent on port 4750, pretending to be a legitimate Application Server. By sending a 'TLS' or 'TLSRPC' packet followed by the malicious 'Server intro' and 'action' packets (for example, to change password or execute a command), the attacker can execute commands with privileges of the mapped system user.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the target system running the vulnerable RSCD agent. No prior authentication is required, and the attacker can send arbitrary commands after initiating a TLS connection."
