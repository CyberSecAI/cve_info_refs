## Issue [2103663002](/2103663002/): [Extensions] Rework inline installation observation (Closed)

| **Created:** 4 years, 5 months ago by [Devlin](/user/Devlin)  **Modified:** 4 years, 5 months ago  **Reviewers:** [lazyboy](/user/lazyboy)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, chromium-apps-reviews\_chromium.org, extensions-reviews\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.

This is a great deal less code, more direct, and also fixes a lifetime issue with the TabHelper being deleted before the inline installation completes.

Test would be helpful :)  D'oh, I knew you would say that! ;)  So, looking into this, it's actually rather painful. - We have a check renderer side as well that prevents duplicate installs early. - But that won't catch all cases - e.g., if two separate JS contexts call it. - They emit separate error messages. :(  I added a test for the most common case - two calls from the same JS context - but I'm not sure it's worth it to manufacture a test for the other.  Let me know what you think.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/07/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, July 20, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 52 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 52.0.2743.82 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/51.0.2704.106..52.0.2743.82?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 52.
#### Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [48 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M52). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[629852](https://crbug.com/629852)] CVE-2016-1705: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
