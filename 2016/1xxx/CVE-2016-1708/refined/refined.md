Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Chrome Web Store inline-installation implementation within the Extensions subsystem. This occurs due to improper management of object lifetimes during progress observation. Specifically, the `TabHelper` object could be deleted before the inline extension installation completes, leading to access of freed memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free, where a program tries to access memory that has already been freed.
- **Improper Lifetime Management:** The code doesn't properly manage the lifetime of objects involved in observing the progress of extension installations, leading to the use-after-free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, where the browser may crash due to the use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Unspecified other impact:**  The CVE description also mentions a "possibly unspecified other impact", which could potentially include other forms of corruption if the freed memory is reallocated for something else, although no specific details are given.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Web Site:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted web site.
- **Inline Installation:** The attack is specific to the inline installation process of extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the attack is triggered by the victim visiting a malicious web page.
- **Web Site Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a web page capable of triggering the inline installation of an extension in a manner that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by reworking the inline installation observation to observe directly in the `TabHelper` and not through the WebstoreAPI.
- This change was aimed to reduce code complexity, improve directness and resolve the lifetime issue.
- The fix also included addition of tests for preventing duplicate installs.
