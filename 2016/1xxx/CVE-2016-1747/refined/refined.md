Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `IOGraphicsFamily` interface, specifically due to the failure to validate user-supplied function addresses before using them. This allows for an untrusted pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Untrusted pointer dereference
- Lack of input validation for user-supplied function addresses
- Memory corruption issue

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and execute code within the context of the kernel.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows for the execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** This is a local attack vector, requiring the attacker to have some level of access to the system.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, such as opening a maliciously crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to craft a malicious file that exploits the `IOGraphicsFamily` interface vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by Apple in a security update.
- The vulnerability was reported by Juwei Lin of Trend Micro.
- The advisory provides a CVSS score of 6.9, with an attack vector of local, medium complexity, and complete confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
