{
  "CVE-2016-1548": {
    "Description": "An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.",
    "Root cause": "ntpd clients could be forced to change from basic client/server mode to interleaved symmetric mode by spoofing a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the peer->dst timestamp.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Data Processing Errors"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service or alter the time of an ntpd client by forcing it to switch to interleaved symmetric mode. After the mode switch the client will reject all future legitimate server responses, or, if attacker has ongoing access to peer->dst, the attacker can set the time on the client after the mode has been changed.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a spoofed packet from a legitimate ntpd server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send a spoofed packet with a matching timestamp. If the attacker wants to control the time after the mode change they need to have ongoing access to the current value of peer->dst."
