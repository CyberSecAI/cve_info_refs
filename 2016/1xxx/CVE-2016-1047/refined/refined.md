Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition in the `signatureSetSeedValue` method of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: A dangling pointer is created and then reused after it has been freed, due to specially crafted arguments passed to `signatureSetSeedValue`. This leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This can lead to a complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- User interaction required: The victim needs to interact with a malicious file or visit a malicious web page to trigger the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or webpage with specific arguments to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability in the `signatureSetSeedValue` method.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim to open the crafted malicious file or browse the malicious webpage.
