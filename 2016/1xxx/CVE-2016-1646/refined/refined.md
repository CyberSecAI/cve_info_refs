Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an error in the `Array.prototype.concat` implementation within the Google V8 JavaScript engine. Specifically, the code doesn't correctly handle element data types during array concatenation. This flaw can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This is caused by improper handling of data types during array concatenation which could allow access to uninitialized memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read, causing the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** There is a possibility of other unspecified impacts from the vulnerability, although no specific details are available. The out-of-bounds read could potentially reveal sensitive information or enable further exploitation depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted JavaScript Code:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted JavaScript code. This implies a network attack vector, where a malicious webpage with the malicious JavaScript code can be used to target a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:**  A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by delivering crafted JavaScript code to a vulnerable browser. This can be done by enticing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage, or through other methods that involve running malicious javascript.

**Summary of Relevant Information:**

*   The core issue lies in the way `Array.prototype.concat` handles different element types.
*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which can result in a denial of service.
*   Exploitation involves crafted JavaScript, making a remote attack vector possible.
*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability affects Google Chrome before version 49.0.2623.108 as well as potentially other products that use the V8 engine.
*   Patches have been released by multiple vendors (Red Hat, Debian, SUSE, Ubuntu, Gentoo), indicating the widespread impact of the vulnerability.

The provided content gives more details than the initial CVE description. It pinpoints the location of the bug to a specific function (`Array.prototype.concat`) and the component responsible (`V8`). The exploit vector (crafted javascript code) is also defined.
