Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw within the HTTP web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The web interface is susceptible to XSS attacks. This means an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within a user's browser session when they interact with the vulnerable web interface.
- This could lead to various malicious actions such as:
   - Session hijacking
   - Credential theft
   - Modification of web content
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
- The integrity of the web interface is at risk since malicious scripts could alter the display or functionality intended by the interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attacker doesn't need local access to the affected system. They can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker doesn't need to be logged in or authenticated with the vulnerable web application to perform the XSS attack.
- HTTP web-based management interface: The attack targets the web interface of the Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Software.
- The attacker can craft malicious input and embed it within a link, form or another kind of request, and cause that malicious code to execute on a user's browser when the user interacts with the vulnerable web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable UCCE system.
- Ability to craft malicious input to be injected into the vulnerable web application.
- Ability to convince a victim user of the vulnerable web interface to interact with the attacker's crafted malicious input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided CVSS vector string is: `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:U/RC:C`. The base score is 4.3 and temporal score is 3.7.
- The advisory confirms the vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Software.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability described in the advisory.
- There are no workarounds available, so users must apply the software update.
