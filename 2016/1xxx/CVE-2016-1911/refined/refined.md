The provided content describes two distinct XSS vulnerabilities in SAP NetWeaver 7.4, identified as ERPSCAN-16-001 and ERPSCAN-16-004. Both are related to SAP NetWeaver J2EE Engine 7.40. However, since there is no CVE number mentioned in the content, it is impossible to determine which one of the two is related to CVE-2016-1911.

The first vulnerability, **ERPSCAN-16-001**, is located in the RWB component.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of user-supplied input in the RWB component.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Modification of displayed application content, potentially leading to session hijacking and information disclosure, including authentication information of legitimate users. The advisory mentions that "still anti-SCRF tokens" are not bypassed.
*   **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be anonymous and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

The second vulnerability, **ERPSCAN-16-004**, is located in the `Pmitest` servlet.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of user-supplied input in the `Pmitest` servlet.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Modification of displayed application content, potentially leading to session hijacking and information disclosure, including authentication information of legitimate users.
*   **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be anonymous and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

Both advisories state that other versions of SAP NetWeaver might be affected. Both vulnerabilities have a CVSS base score of 4.3, with network attack vector, medium attack complexity, no authentication required. They both impact integrity.

Given that the CVE is a placeholder, these are the two best candidates within the provided context. However, given the lack of confirmation, they should be treated as separate vulnerabilities.
