The provided content contains information about CVE-2016-1780.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an issue in the handling of device-orientation and device-motion data when a web view is hidden.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A hidden web page was able to access device-orientation and device-motion data. This means sensitive sensor data could be accessed by a website even when the user is not actively interacting with it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A website can track sensitive user information without the user's knowledge. This potentially allows websites to gather details about the user's behavior and physical activity even when the user does not think they are actively interacting with the page or website.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious website could exploit this vulnerability by running in the background (hidden web page) and accessing device-orientation and device-motion data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to create and host a malicious website that attempts to access this data through a hidden web view.
