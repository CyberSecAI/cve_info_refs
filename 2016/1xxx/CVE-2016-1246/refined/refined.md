Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` with a fixed-size buffer to construct an error message when binding non-numeric values. The error message included the potentially untrusted user-provided value, leading to a buffer overflow if the input string was too long.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the error message generation within the `dbd_bind_ph` function, specifically when handling non-numeric parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow could lead to a crash due to a `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` failure, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated as achieved, a buffer overflow vulnerability can be a stepping stone for arbitrary code execution if exploited with specific techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection/Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit this by providing crafted, overly long, non-numeric input values as parameters to a prepared SQL statement, specifically through the `bind_param` family of functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker must be able to pass data that will be used in a bind parameter to a vulnerable SQL query.
*   **Knowledge of code path:** Some knowledge of how the application uses non-numeric values in bind parameters would make exploiting this vulnerability easier.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in DBD::mysql versions back to 3.0.
*   The fix involved switching to `newSVpvf` to dynamically allocate the buffer for the error message, rather than a fixed-size buffer.
*   The issue was discovered and fixed by Pali Roh√°r.
*   The vulnerability impacts applications that rely on the `bind_param` functionality with non-numeric data and may not affect applications that don't use it.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered both locally and remotely

This vulnerability highlights the dangers of using fixed-size buffers with untrusted input, especially when dealing with string formatting functions like `sprintf`. The fix involves dynamic allocation to accommodate variable-length input.
