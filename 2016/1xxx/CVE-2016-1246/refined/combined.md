# NAME

DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)

# SYNOPSIS

```
use DBI;

my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);

my $sth = $dbh->prepare(
    'SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM authors WHERE last_name = ?')
    or die "prepare statement failed: $dbh->errstr()";
$sth->execute('Eggers') or die "execution failed: $dbh->errstr()";
print $sth->rows . " rows found.\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
    print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, fn = $ref->{'first_name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish;
```
# EXAMPLE

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;

# Connect to the database.
my $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
                       "joe", "joe's password",
                       {'RaiseError' => 1});

# Drop table 'foo'. This may fail, if 'foo' doesn't exist
# Thus we put an eval around it.
eval { $dbh->do("DROP TABLE foo") };
print "Dropping foo failed: $@\n" if $@;

# Create a new table 'foo'. This must not fail, thus we don't
# catch errors.
$dbh->do("CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(20))");

# INSERT some data into 'foo'. We are using $dbh->quote() for
# quoting the name.
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, " . $dbh->quote("Tim") . ")");

# same thing, but using placeholders (recommended!)
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef, 2, "Jochen");

# now retrieve data from the table.
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM foo");
$sth->execute();
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
  print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, name = $ref->{'name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish();

# Disconnect from the database.
$dbh->disconnect();
```
# DESCRIPTION

**DBD::mysql** is the Perl5 Database Interface driver for the MySQL database. In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl programming language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the MySQL relational database management system. Most functions provided by this programming API are supported. Some rarely used functions are missing, mainly because no-one ever requested them. :-)

In what follows we first discuss the use of DBD::mysql, because this is what you will need the most. For installation, see the separate document [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod). See ["EXAMPLE"](#EXAMPLE) for a simple example above.

From perl you activate the interface with the statement

```
use DBI;
```

After that you can connect to multiple MySQL database servers and send multiple queries to any of them via a simple object oriented interface. Two types of objects are available: database handles and statement handles. Perl returns a database handle to the connect method like so:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=$db;host=$host",
  $user, $password, {RaiseError => 1});
```

Once you have connected to a database, you can execute SQL statements with:

```
  my $query = sprintf("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%d, %s)",
		      $number, $dbh->quote("name"));
  $dbh->do($query);
```

See [DBI](/pod/DBI) for details on the quote and do methods. An alternative approach is

```
  $dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef,
	   $number, $name);
```

in which case the quote method is executed automatically. See also the bind\_param method in [DBI](/pod/DBI). See ["DATABASE HANDLES"](#DATABASE-HANDLES) below for more details on database handles.

If you want to retrieve results, you need to create a so-called statement handle with:

```
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table");
$sth->execute();
```

This statement handle can be used for multiple things. First of all you can retrieve a row of data:

```
my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref();
```

If your table has columns ID and NAME, then $row will be hash ref with keys ID and NAME. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES) below for more details on statement handles.

But now for a more formal approach:

## Class Methods

**connect**
```
use DBI;

$dsn = "DBI:mysql:$database";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";

$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

The `database` is not a required attribute, but please note that MySQL has no such thing as a default database. If you don't specify the database at connection time your active database will be null and you'd need to prefix your tables with the database name; i.e. 'SELECT \* FROM mydb.mytable'.

This is similar to the behavior of the mysql command line client. Also, 'SELECT DATABASE()' will return the current database active for the handle.

host

port

The hostname, if not specified or specified as '' or 'localhost', will default to a MySQL server running on the local machine using the default for the UNIX socket. To connect to a MySQL server on the local machine via TCP, you must specify the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1) as the host.

Should the MySQL server be running on a non-standard port number, you may explicitly state the port number to connect to in the `hostname` argument, by concatenating the *hostname* and *port number* together separated by a colon ( `:` ) character or by using the `port` argument.

To connect to a MySQL server on localhost using TCP/IP, you must specify the hostname as 127.0.0.1 (with the optional port).

When connecting to a MySQL Server with IPv6, a bracketed IPv6 address should be used. Example DSN:

```
my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:;host=[1a12:2800:6f2:85::f20:8cf];port=3306";
```

mysql\_client\_found\_rows

If TRUE (Default), sets the CLIENT\_FOUND\_ROWS flag when connecting to MySQL. This causes UPDATE statements to return the number of rows \*matched\*, not the number of rows actually changed.

If you want the number of rows changed in response to an UPDATE statement, specify "mysql\_client\_found\_rows=0" in the DSN.

mysql\_compression

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression", then this will be used to set the compression algorithms for the connection.

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression=1", then the compression algorithms will be set to "zlib". This is for backwards compatibility with older versions of DBD::mysql.

mysql\_connect\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_connect\_timeout=##", the connect request to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_write\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_write\_timeout=##", the write operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_read\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_read\_timeout=##", the read operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_init\_command

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_init\_command=##", then this SQL statement is executed when connecting to the MySQL server. It is automatically re-executed if reconnection occurs.

mysql\_skip\_secure\_auth

This option is for older mysql databases that don't have secure auth set.

mysql\_read\_default\_file

mysql\_read\_default\_group

These options can be used to read a config file like /etc/my.cnf or ~/.my.cnf. By default MySQL's C client library doesn't use any config files unlike the client programs (mysql, mysqladmin, ...) that do, but outside of the C client library. Thus you need to explicitly request reading a config file, as in

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password)
```

The option mysql\_read\_default\_group can be used to specify the default group in the config file: Usually this is the *client* group, but see the following example:

```
[client]
host=localhost

[perl]
host=perlhost
```

(Note the order of the entries! The example won't work, if you reverse the [client] and [perl] sections!)

If you read this config file, then you'll be typically connected to *localhost*. However, by using

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=perl;"
    . "mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

you'll be connected to *perlhost*. Note that if you specify a default group and do not specify a file, then the default config files will all be read. See the documentation of the C function mysql\_options() for details.

mysql\_socket

It is possible to choose the Unix socket that is used for connecting to the server. This is done, for example, with

```
mysql_socket=/dev/mysql
```

Usually there's no need for this option, unless you are using another location for the socket than that built into the client.

mysql\_ssl

A true value turns on the CLIENT\_SSL flag when connecting to the MySQL server and enforce SSL encryption. A false value (which is default) disable SSL encryption with the MySQL server.

When enabling SSL encryption you should set also other SSL options, at least mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file or mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path.

```
mysql_ssl=1 mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert=1 mysql_ssl_ca_file=/path/to/ca_cert.pem
```

This means that your communication with the server will be encrypted.

Please note that this can only work if you enabled SSL when compiling DBD::mysql; this is the default starting version 4.034. See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod) for more details.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file

The path to a file in PEM format that contains a list of trusted SSL certificate authorities.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path

The path to a directory that contains trusted SSL certificate authority certificates in PEM format.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

Please note that this option is supported only if your MySQL client was compiled with OpenSSL library, and not with default yaSSL library.

mysql\_ssl\_verify\_server\_cert

Checks the server's Common Name value in the certificate that the server sends to the client. The client verifies that name against the host name the client uses for connecting to the server, and the connection fails if there is a mismatch. For encrypted connections, this option helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Verification of the host name is disabled by default.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_key

The name of the SSL key file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_cert

The name of the SSL certificate file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_cipher

A list of permissible ciphers to use for connection encryption. If no cipher in the list is supported, encrypted connections will not work.

```
mysql_ssl_cipher=AES128-SHA
mysql_ssl_cipher=DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA
```

mysql\_ssl\_optional

Setting `mysql_ssl_optional` to true disables strict SSL enforcement and makes SSL connection optional. This option opens security hole for man-in-the-middle attacks. Default value is false which means that `mysql_ssl` set to true enforce SSL encryption.

This option was introduced in 4.043 version of DBD::mysql. Due to [The BACKRONYM](http://backronym.fail/) and [The Riddle](http://riddle.link/) vulnerabilities in libmysqlclient library, enforcement of SSL encryption was not possbile and therefore `mysql_ssl_optional=1` was effectively set for all DBD::mysql versions prior to 4.043. Starting with 4.043, DBD::mysql with `mysql_ssl=1` could refuse connection to MySQL server if underlaying libmysqlclient library is vulnerable. Option `mysql_ssl_optional` can be used to make SSL connection vulnerable.

mysql\_server\_pubkey

Path to the RSA public key of the server. This is used for the sha256\_password and caching\_sha2\_password authentication plugins.

mysql\_get\_server\_pubkey

Setting `mysql_get_server_pubkey` to true requests the public RSA key of the server.

mysql\_local\_infile

The LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA may be disabled in the MySQL client library by default. If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_local\_infile=1", LOAD DATA LOCAL will be enabled. (However, this option is \*ineffective\* if the server has also been configured to disallow LOCAL.)

mysql\_multi\_statements

Support for multiple statements separated by a semicolon (;) may be enabled by using this option. Enabling this option may cause problems if server-side prepared statements are also enabled.

mysql\_server\_prepare

This option is used to enable server side prepared statements.

To use server side prepared statements, all you need to do is set the variable mysql\_server\_prepare in the connect:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost;mysql_server_prepare=1",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1 }
);
```

or:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1, mysql_server_prepare => 1 }
);
```

There are many benefits to using server side prepare statements, mostly if you are performing many inserts because of that fact that a single statement is prepared to accept multiple insert values.

To make sure that the 'make test' step tests whether server prepare works, you just need to export the env variable MYSQL\_SERVER\_PREPARE:

```
export MYSQL_SERVER_PREPARE=1
```

Please note that mysql server cannot prepare or execute some prepared statements. In this case DBD::mysql fallbacks to normal non-prepared statement and tries again.

mysql\_server\_prepare\_disable\_fallback

This option disable fallback to normal non-prepared statement when mysql server does not support execution of current statement as prepared.

Useful when you want to be sure that statement is going to be executed as server side prepared. Error message and code in case of failure is propagated back to DBI.

mysql\_conn\_attrs

The option <mysql\_conn\_attrs> is a hash of attribute names and values which can be used to send custom connection attributes to the server. Some attributes like '\_os', '\_platform', '\_client\_name' and '\_client\_version' are added by libmysqlclient and 'program\_name' is added by DBD::mysql.

You can then later read these attributes from the performance schema tables which can be quite helpful for profiling your database or creating statistics.

```
my $dbh= DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password,
  { AutoCommit => 0,
    mysql_conn_attrs => {
      foo => 'bar',
      wiz => 'bang'
    },
  });
```

Now you can select the results from the performance schema tables. You can do this in the same session, but also afterwards. It can be very useful to answer questions like 'which script sent this query?'.

```
my $results = $dbh->selectall_hashref(
  'SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_connect_attrs',
  'ATTR_NAME'
);
```

This returns:

```
$result = {
  'foo' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bar',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'foo',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '6'
  },
  'wiz' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bang',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'wiz',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '3'
  },
  'program_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => './foo.pl',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'program_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '5'
  },
  '_client_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'libmysql',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '1'
  },
  '_client_version' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '5.6.24',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_version',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '7'
  },
  '_os' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'osx10.8',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_os',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '0'
  },
  '_pid' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '59860',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_pid',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '2'
  },
  '_platform' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'x86_64',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_platform',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '4'
  }
};
```

# DATABASE HANDLES

The DBD::mysql driver supports the following attributes of database handles (read only):

```
$errno = $dbh->{'mysql_errno'};
$error = $dbh->{'mysql_error'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_hostinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_info'};
$insertid = $dbh->{'mysql_insertid'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_protoinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_serverinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_stat'};
$threadId = $dbh->{'mysql_thread_id'};
```

These correspond to mysql\_errno(), mysql\_error(), mysql\_get\_host\_info(), mysql\_info(), mysql\_insert\_id(), mysql\_get\_proto\_info(), mysql\_get\_server\_info(), mysql\_stat() and mysql\_thread\_id(), respectively.

mysql\_clientinfo

List information of the MySQL client library that DBD::mysql was built against:

```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientinfo}\n";

8.3.0
```

mysql\_clientversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_serverversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_serverversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_dbd\_stats
```
$info_hashref = $dbh->{mysql_dbd_stats};
```

DBD::mysql keeps track of some statistics in the mysql\_dbd\_stats attribute. The following stats are being maintained:

auto\_reconnects\_ok

The number of times that DBD::mysql successfully reconnected to the mysql server.

auto\_reconnects\_failed

The number of times that DBD::mysql tried to reconnect to mysql but failed.

The DBD::mysql driver also supports the following attributes of database handles (read/write):

mysql\_auto\_reconnect

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql will automatically reconnect to mysql if the connection be lost. This feature defaults to off; however, if either the GATEWAY\_INTERFACE or MOD\_PERL environment variable is set, DBD::mysql will turn mysql\_auto\_reconnect on. Setting mysql\_auto\_reconnect to on is not advised if 'lock tables' is used because if DBD::mysql reconnect to mysql all table locks will be lost. This attribute is ignored when AutoCommit is turned off, and when AutoCommit is turned off, DBD::mysql will not automatically reconnect to the server.

It is also possible to set the default value of the `mysql_auto_reconnect` attribute for the $dbh by passing it in the `\%attr` hash for `DBI-`connect>.

```
$dbh->{mysql_auto_reconnect} = 1;
```

or

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password, {
   mysql_auto_reconnect => 1,
});
```

Note that if you are using a module or framework that performs reconnections for you (for example [DBIx::Connector](/pod/DBIx%3A%3AConnector) in fixup mode), this value must be set to 0.

mysql\_use\_result

This attribute forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. mysql\_store\_result is the default due to that fact storing the result is expected behavior with most applications.

It is possible to set the default value of the `mysql_use_result` attribute for the $dbh via the DSN:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:test;mysql_use_result=1", "root", "");
```

You can also set it after creation of the database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 0; # disable
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 1; # enable
```

You can also set or unset the `mysql_use_result` setting on your statement handle, when creating the statement handle or after it has been created. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES).

mysql\_enable\_utf8

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql should assume strings stored in the database are utf8. This feature defaults to off.

When set, a data retrieved from a textual column type (char, varchar, etc) will have the UTF-8 flag turned on if necessary. This enables character semantics on that string. You will also need to ensure that your database / table / column is configured to use UTF8. See for more information the chapter on character set support in the MySQL manual: <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset.html>

Additionally, turning on this flag tells MySQL that incoming data should be treated as UTF-8. This will only take effect if used as part of the call to connect(). If you turn the flag on after connecting, you will need to issue the command `SET NAMES utf8` to get the same effect.

This flag's implementation suffers the "Unicode Bug" on passed statements and input bind parameters, and cannot be fixed for historical reasons. In order to pass strings with Unicode characters consistently through DBD::mysql, you can use a "hack" workaround of calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function on scalars immediately before passing them to DBD::mysql. Calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function has absolutely no effect on (correctly written) Perl code, but forces DBD::mysql to interpret it correctly as text data to be encoded. In the same way, binary (byte) data can be passed through DBD::mysql without being encoded as text data by calling the `utf8::downgrade()` function (it dies on wide Unicode strings with codepoints above U+FF). See the following example:

```
# check that last name contains LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH STROKE (U+D8)
my $statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name LIKE '%\x{D8}%' AND first_name = ? AND data = ?";

my $wide_string_param = "Andr\x{E9}"; # Andre with LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+E9)

my $byte_param = "\x{D8}\x{A0}\x{39}\x{F8}"; # some bytes (binary data)

my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:database', 'username', 'pass', { mysql_enable_utf8mb4 => 1 });

utf8::upgrade($statement); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement);

utf8::upgrade($wide_string_param); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(1, $wide_string_param);

utf8::downgrade($byte_param); # byte fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(2, $byte_param, DBI::SQL_BINARY); # set correct binary type

$sth->execute();

my $output = $sth->fetchall_arrayref();
# returned data in $output reference should be already UTF-8 decoded as appropriate
```

mysql\_enable\_utf8mb4

This is similar to mysql\_enable\_utf8, but is capable of handling 4-byte UTF-8 characters.

mysql\_bind\_type\_guessing

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) to attempt to guess if a value being bound is a numeric value, and if so, doesn't quote the value. This was created by Dragonchild and is one way to deal with the performance issue of using quotes in a statement that is inserting or updating a large numeric value. This was previously called `unsafe_bind_type_guessing` because it is experimental. I have successfully run the full test suite with this option turned on, the name can now be simply `mysql_bind_type_guessing`.

CAVEAT: Even though you can insert an integer value into a character column, if this column is indexed, if you query that column with the integer value not being quoted, it will not use the index:

```
mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = '3' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ref
possible_keys: value0
          key: value0
      key_len: 13
          ref: const
         rows: 1
        Extra: Using index condition
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = 3
    -> \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ALL
possible_keys: value0
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 6
        Extra: Using where
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

See bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43822

`mysql_bind_type_guessing` can be turned on via

```
- through DSN

 my $dbh= DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
 { mysql_bind_type_guessing => 1})

 - OR after handle creation

 $dbh->{mysql_bind_type_guessing} = 1;
```

mysql\_bind\_comment\_placeholders

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) will cause any placeholders in comments to be bound. This is not correct prepared statement behavior, but some developers have come to depend on this behavior, so I have made it available in 4.015

mysql\_no\_autocommit\_cmd

This attribute causes the driver to not issue 'set autocommit' either through explicit or using mysql\_autocommit(). This is particularly useful in the case of using MySQL Proxy.

See the bug report:

https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46308

`mysql_no_autocommit_cmd` can be turned on when creating the database handle:

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
{ mysql_no_autocommit_cmd => 1});
```

or using an existing database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_no_autocommit_cmd} = 1;
```

ping

This can be used to send a ping to the server.

```
$rc = $dbh->ping();
```

# STATEMENT HANDLES

The statement handles of DBD::mysql support a number of attributes. You access these by using, for example,

```
my $numFields = $sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
```

Note, that most attributes are valid only after a successful *execute*. An `undef` value will returned otherwise. The most important exception is the `mysql_use_result` attribute, which forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. (That's why mysql\_store\_result is the default.)

To set the `mysql_use_result` attribute, use either of the following:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("QUERY", { mysql_use_result => 1});
```

or

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
$sth->{mysql_use_result} = 1;
```

Column dependent attributes, for example *NAME*, the column names, are returned as a reference to an array. The array indices are corresponding to the indices of the arrays returned by *fetchrow* and similar methods. For example the following code will print a header of table names together with all rows:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table") ||
  die "Error:" . $dbh->errstr . "\n";

$sth->execute ||  die "Error:" . $sth->errstr . "\n";

my $names = $sth->{NAME};
my $numFields = $sth->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'} - 1;
for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$names[$i]);
}
print "\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref) {
    for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$ref[$i]);
    }
    print "\n";
}
```

For portable applications you should restrict yourself to attributes with capitalized or mixed case names. Uppercase attribute names are in the statement handle interface described by [DBI](/pod/DBI), while lower case attribute names are private to DBD::mysql. The attribute list includes:

NAME

A reference to an array of column names, as per DBI docs.

NULLABLE

A reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that this column may contain NULL's.

NUM\_OF\_FIELDS

Number of fields returned by a *SELECT* or *LISTFIELDS* statement. You may use this for checking whether a statement returned a result: A zero value indicates a non-SELECT statement like *INSERT*, *DELETE* or *UPDATE*.

TYPE

A reference to an array of column types. The engine's native column types are mapped to portable types like DBI::SQL\_INTEGER() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(), as good as possible. Not all native types have a meaningful equivalent, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_INTERVAL is mapped to DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(). If you need the native column types, use *mysql\_type*. See below.

ChopBlanks

this attribute determines whether a *fetchrow* will chop preceding and trailing blanks off the column values. Chopping blanks does not have impact on the *max\_length* attribute.

ParamValues

This attribute is supported as described in the DBI documentation.

It returns a hashref, the keys of which are the 'names' of the placeholders: integers starting at 1. It returns an empty hashref if the statement has no placeholders.

The values for these keys are initially undef; they are populated with `bind_param`, or when `execute` method is called with parameters. (Supplying the parameter values in the arguments to `execute` will override any previously bound values.)

After execution, it is possible to use `bind_param` to change a single parameter value and `execute` the statement again, with other values unchanged. The attribute remains properly populated after the `finish` method is called, with the values from the last execution.

mysql\_gtids

Returns GTID(s) if GTID session tracking is ensabled in the server via session\_track\_gtids.

mysql\_insertid

If the statement you executed performs an INSERT, and there is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column in the table you inserted in, this attribute holds the value stored into the AUTO\_INCREMENT column, if that value is automatically generated, by storing NULL or 0 or was specified as an explicit value.

Typically, you'd access the value via $sth->{mysql\_insertid}. The value can also be accessed via $dbh->{mysql\_insertid} but this can easily produce incorrect results in case one database handle is shared.

mysql\_is\_blob

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a blob. This attribute is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a key. This is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_num

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column contains numeric values.

mysql\_is\_pri\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a primary key.

mysql\_is\_auto\_increment

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that the respective column is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column. This is only valid for MySQL.

mysql\_length

mysql\_max\_length

A reference to an array of maximum column sizes. The *max\_length* is the maximum physically present in the result table, *length* gives the theoretically possible maximum. *max\_length* is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_table

A reference to an array of table names, useful in a *JOIN* result.

mysql\_type

A reference to an array of MySQL's native column types, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_SHORT() or DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_STRING(). Use the *TYPE* attribute, if you want portable types like DBI::SQL\_SMALLINT() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR().

mysql\_type\_name

Similar to mysql, but type names and not numbers are returned. Whenever possible, the ANSI SQL name is preferred.

mysql\_warning\_count

The number of warnings generated during execution of the SQL statement. This attribute is available on both statement handles and database handles.

# TRANSACTION SUPPORT

The transaction support works as follows:

* By default AutoCommit mode is on, following the DBI specifications.
* If you execute

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  ```

  or

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 1;
  ```

  then the driver will set the MySQL server variable autocommit to 0 or 1, respectively. Switching from 0 to 1 will also issue a COMMIT, following the DBI specifications.
* The methods

  ```
  $dbh->rollback();
  $dbh->commit();
  ```

  will issue the commands ROLLBACK and COMMIT, respectively. A ROLLBACK will also be issued if AutoCommit mode is off and the database handles DESTROY method is called. Again, this is following the DBI specifications.

Given the above, you should note the following:

* You should never change the server variable autocommit manually, unless you are ignoring DBI's transaction support.
* Switching AutoCommit mode from on to off or vice versa may fail. You should always check for errors when changing AutoCommit mode. The suggested way of doing so is using the DBI flag RaiseError. If you don't like RaiseError, you have to use code like the following:

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  if ($dbh->{AutoCommit}) {
    # An error occurred!
  }
  ```
* If you detect an error while changing the AutoCommit mode, you should no longer use the database handle. In other words, you should disconnect and reconnect again, because the transaction mode is unpredictable. Alternatively you may verify the transaction mode by checking the value of the server variable autocommit. However, such behaviour isn't portable.
* DBD::mysql has a "reconnect" feature that handles the so-called MySQL "morning bug": If the server has disconnected, most probably due to a timeout, then by default the driver will reconnect and attempt to execute the same SQL statement again. However, this behaviour is disabled when AutoCommit is off: Otherwise the transaction state would be completely unpredictable after a reconnect.
* The "reconnect" feature of DBD::mysql can be toggled by using the [mysql\_auto\_reconnect](/pod/mysql_auto_reconnect) attribute. This behaviour should be turned off in code that uses LOCK TABLE because if the database server time out and DBD::mysql reconnect, table locks will be lost without any indication of such loss.

# MULTIPLE RESULT SETS

DBD::mysql supports multiple result sets, thanks to Guy Harrison!

The basic usage of multiple result sets is

```
do
{
  while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array())
  {
    do stuff;
  }
} while ($sth->more_results)
```

An example would be:

```
$dbh->do("drop procedure if exists someproc") or print $DBI::errstr;

$dbh->do("create procedure someproc() deterministic
 begin
 declare a,b,c,d int;
 set a=1;
 set b=2;
 set c=3;
 set d=4;
 select a, b, c, d;
 select d, c, b, a;
 select b, a, c, d;
 select c, b, d, a;
end") or print $DBI::errstr;

$sth=$dbh->prepare('call someproc()') ||
die $DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr;

$sth->execute || die DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr; $rowset=0;
do {
  print "\nRowset ".++$i."\n---------------------------------------\n\n";
  foreach $colno (0..$sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS}-1) {
    print $sth->{NAME}->[$colno]."\t";
  }
  print "\n";
  while (@row= $sth->fetchrow_array())  {
    foreach $field (0..$#row) {
      print $row[$field]."\t";
    }
    print "\n";
  }
} until (!$sth->more_results)
```
## Issues with multiple result sets

Please be aware there could be issues if your result sets are "jagged", meaning the number of columns of your results vary. Varying numbers of columns could result in your script crashing.

# MULTITHREADING

The multithreading capabilities of DBD::mysql depend completely on the underlying C libraries. The modules are working with handle data only, no global variables are accessed or (to the best of my knowledge) thread unsafe functions are called. Thus DBD::mysql is believed to be completely thread safe, if the C libraries are thread safe and you don't share handles among threads.

The obvious question is: Are the C libraries thread safe? In the case of MySQL the answer is yes, since MySQL 5.5 it is.

# ASYNCHRONOUS QUERIES

You can make a single asynchronous query per MySQL connection; this allows you to submit a long-running query to the server and have an event loop inform you when it's ready. An asynchronous query is started by either setting the 'async' attribute to a true value in the ["do" in DBI](/pod/DBI#do) method, or in the ["prepare" in DBI](/pod/DBI#prepare) method. Statements created with 'async' set to true in prepare always run their queries asynchronously when ["execute" in DBI](/pod/DBI#execute) is called. The driver also offers three additional methods: `mysql_async_result`, `mysql_async_ready`, and `mysql_fd`. `mysql_async_result` returns what do or execute would have; that is, the number of rows affected. `mysql_async_ready` returns true if `mysql_async_result` will not block, and zero otherwise. They both return `undef` if that handle was not created with 'async' set to true or if an asynchronous query was not started yet. `mysql_fd` returns the file descriptor number for the MySQL connection; you can use this in an event loop.

Here's an example of how to use the asynchronous query interface:

```
use feature 'say';
$dbh->do('SELECT SLEEP(10)', { async => 1 });
until($dbh->mysql_async_ready) {
  say 'not ready yet!';
  sleep 1;
}
my $rows = $dbh->mysql_async_result;
```
# INSTALLATION

See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod).

# AUTHORS

Originally, there was a non-DBI driver, Mysql, which was much like PHP drivers such as mysql and mysqli. The **Mysql** module was originally written by Andreas König <koenig@kulturbox.de> who still, to this day, contributes patches to DBD::mysql. An emulated version of Mysql was provided to DBD::mysql from Jochen Wiedmann, but eventually deprecated as it was another bundle of code to maintain.

The first incarnation of DBD::mysql was developed by Alligator Descartes, who was also aided and abetted by Gary Shea, Andreas König and Tim Bunce.

The current incarnation of **DBD::mysql** was written by Jochen Wiedmann, then numerous changes and bug-fixes were added by Rudy Lippan. Next, prepared statement support was added by Patrick Galbraith and Alexy Stroganov (who also solely added embedded server support).

For the past nine years DBD::mysql has been maintained by Patrick Galbraith (*patg@patg.net*), and recently with the great help of Michiel Beijen (*michiel.beijen@gmail.com*), along with the entire community of Perl developers who keep sending patches to help continue improving DBD::mysql

Package        : libdbd-mysql-perl
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-1246

Paul Rohar discovered that libdbd-mysql-perl, the Perl DBI database
driver for MySQL and MariaDB, constructed an error message in a
fixed-length buffer, leading to a crash (_FORTIFY_SOURCE failure) and,
potentially, to denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.028-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-mysql-perl packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply

## SECURITY RELEASE - Buffer overflow in DBD::mysql perl library

By [Mike B](https://blogs.perl.org/users/mike_b/)
on October 3, 2016 8:47 AM

[DBD::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3Amysql) is the perl DBI driver for MySQL and the primary way Perl
applications and scripts access MySQL and MariaDB databases. The source
repository is at <https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql>.

A vulnerability was discovered that can lead to a buffer overflow, possibly
triggered by user supplied data. This vulnerability is present in all releases
at least back to versions 3.0 of the driver, which were released in 2005.

The CVE identifier for this vulnerability is CVE-2016-1246.

Version 4.037, including the fix for this vulnerability, is available on CPAN at
[https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3Amysql)

Users of DBD::mysql are advised to patch their installations as soon as
possible.

We have already made a pre-announcement for this security release at
the distros security mailing list. People using DBD::mysql installed from their
(linux) distributions can expect to receive an updated version soon.

Many thanks to Pali RohÃ¡r for discovering and fixing the vulnerability.

The DBD::mysql maintainers,
Patrick Galbraith

Do I undertand correctly, that only code, which uses bind\_param\* function family is affected? And If code does not use it, there is no security risk to use old version?

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# NAME

DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)

# SYNOPSIS

```
use DBI;

my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);

my $sth = $dbh->prepare(
    'SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM authors WHERE last_name = ?')
    or die "prepare statement failed: $dbh->errstr()";
$sth->execute('Eggers') or die "execution failed: $dbh->errstr()";
print $sth->rows . " rows found.\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
    print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, fn = $ref->{'first_name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish;
```
# EXAMPLE

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;

# Connect to the database.
my $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
                       "joe", "joe's password",
                       {'RaiseError' => 1});

# Drop table 'foo'. This may fail, if 'foo' doesn't exist
# Thus we put an eval around it.
eval { $dbh->do("DROP TABLE foo") };
print "Dropping foo failed: $@\n" if $@;

# Create a new table 'foo'. This must not fail, thus we don't
# catch errors.
$dbh->do("CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(20))");

# INSERT some data into 'foo'. We are using $dbh->quote() for
# quoting the name.
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, " . $dbh->quote("Tim") . ")");

# same thing, but using placeholders (recommended!)
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef, 2, "Jochen");

# now retrieve data from the table.
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM foo");
$sth->execute();
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
  print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, name = $ref->{'name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish();

# Disconnect from the database.
$dbh->disconnect();
```
# DESCRIPTION

**DBD::mysql** is the Perl5 Database Interface driver for the MySQL database. In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl programming language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the MySQL relational database management system. Most functions provided by this programming API are supported. Some rarely used functions are missing, mainly because no-one ever requested them. :-)

In what follows we first discuss the use of DBD::mysql, because this is what you will need the most. For installation, see the separate document [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod). See ["EXAMPLE"](#EXAMPLE) for a simple example above.

From perl you activate the interface with the statement

```
use DBI;
```

After that you can connect to multiple MySQL database servers and send multiple queries to any of them via a simple object oriented interface. Two types of objects are available: database handles and statement handles. Perl returns a database handle to the connect method like so:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=$db;host=$host",
  $user, $password, {RaiseError => 1});
```

Once you have connected to a database, you can execute SQL statements with:

```
  my $query = sprintf("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%d, %s)",
		      $number, $dbh->quote("name"));
  $dbh->do($query);
```

See [DBI](/pod/DBI) for details on the quote and do methods. An alternative approach is

```
  $dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef,
	   $number, $name);
```

in which case the quote method is executed automatically. See also the bind\_param method in [DBI](/pod/DBI). See ["DATABASE HANDLES"](#DATABASE-HANDLES) below for more details on database handles.

If you want to retrieve results, you need to create a so-called statement handle with:

```
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table");
$sth->execute();
```

This statement handle can be used for multiple things. First of all you can retrieve a row of data:

```
my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref();
```

If your table has columns ID and NAME, then $row will be hash ref with keys ID and NAME. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES) below for more details on statement handles.

But now for a more formal approach:

## Class Methods

**connect**
```
use DBI;

$dsn = "DBI:mysql:$database";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";

$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

The `database` is not a required attribute, but please note that MySQL has no such thing as a default database. If you don't specify the database at connection time your active database will be null and you'd need to prefix your tables with the database name; i.e. 'SELECT \* FROM mydb.mytable'.

This is similar to the behavior of the mysql command line client. Also, 'SELECT DATABASE()' will return the current database active for the handle.

host

port

The hostname, if not specified or specified as '' or 'localhost', will default to a MySQL server running on the local machine using the default for the UNIX socket. To connect to a MySQL server on the local machine via TCP, you must specify the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1) as the host.

Should the MySQL server be running on a non-standard port number, you may explicitly state the port number to connect to in the `hostname` argument, by concatenating the *hostname* and *port number* together separated by a colon ( `:` ) character or by using the `port` argument.

To connect to a MySQL server on localhost using TCP/IP, you must specify the hostname as 127.0.0.1 (with the optional port).

When connecting to a MySQL Server with IPv6, a bracketed IPv6 address should be used. Example DSN:

```
my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:;host=[1a12:2800:6f2:85::f20:8cf];port=3306";
```

mysql\_client\_found\_rows

If TRUE (Default), sets the CLIENT\_FOUND\_ROWS flag when connecting to MySQL. This causes UPDATE statements to return the number of rows \*matched\*, not the number of rows actually changed.

If you want the number of rows changed in response to an UPDATE statement, specify "mysql\_client\_found\_rows=0" in the DSN.

mysql\_compression

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression", then this will be used to set the compression algorithms for the connection.

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression=1", then the compression algorithms will be set to "zlib". This is for backwards compatibility with older versions of DBD::mysql.

mysql\_connect\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_connect\_timeout=##", the connect request to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_write\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_write\_timeout=##", the write operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_read\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_read\_timeout=##", the read operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_init\_command

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_init\_command=##", then this SQL statement is executed when connecting to the MySQL server. It is automatically re-executed if reconnection occurs.

mysql\_skip\_secure\_auth

This option is for older mysql databases that don't have secure auth set.

mysql\_read\_default\_file

mysql\_read\_default\_group

These options can be used to read a config file like /etc/my.cnf or ~/.my.cnf. By default MySQL's C client library doesn't use any config files unlike the client programs (mysql, mysqladmin, ...) that do, but outside of the C client library. Thus you need to explicitly request reading a config file, as in

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password)
```

The option mysql\_read\_default\_group can be used to specify the default group in the config file: Usually this is the *client* group, but see the following example:

```
[client]
host=localhost

[perl]
host=perlhost
```

(Note the order of the entries! The example won't work, if you reverse the [client] and [perl] sections!)

If you read this config file, then you'll be typically connected to *localhost*. However, by using

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=perl;"
    . "mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

you'll be connected to *perlhost*. Note that if you specify a default group and do not specify a file, then the default config files will all be read. See the documentation of the C function mysql\_options() for details.

mysql\_socket

It is possible to choose the Unix socket that is used for connecting to the server. This is done, for example, with

```
mysql_socket=/dev/mysql
```

Usually there's no need for this option, unless you are using another location for the socket than that built into the client.

mysql\_ssl

A true value turns on the CLIENT\_SSL flag when connecting to the MySQL server and enforce SSL encryption. A false value (which is default) disable SSL encryption with the MySQL server.

When enabling SSL encryption you should set also other SSL options, at least mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file or mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path.

```
mysql_ssl=1 mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert=1 mysql_ssl_ca_file=/path/to/ca_cert.pem
```

This means that your communication with the server will be encrypted.

Please note that this can only work if you enabled SSL when compiling DBD::mysql; this is the default starting version 4.034. See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod) for more details.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file

The path to a file in PEM format that contains a list of trusted SSL certificate authorities.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path

The path to a directory that contains trusted SSL certificate authority certificates in PEM format.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

Please note that this option is supported only if your MySQL client was compiled with OpenSSL library, and not with default yaSSL library.

mysql\_ssl\_verify\_server\_cert

Checks the server's Common Name value in the certificate that the server sends to the client. The client verifies that name against the host name the client uses for connecting to the server, and the connection fails if there is a mismatch. For encrypted connections, this option helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Verification of the host name is disabled by default.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_key

The name of the SSL key file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_cert

The name of the SSL certificate file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_cipher

A list of permissible ciphers to use for connection encryption. If no cipher in the list is supported, encrypted connections will not work.

```
mysql_ssl_cipher=AES128-SHA
mysql_ssl_cipher=DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA
```

mysql\_ssl\_optional

Setting `mysql_ssl_optional` to true disables strict SSL enforcement and makes SSL connection optional. This option opens security hole for man-in-the-middle attacks. Default value is false which means that `mysql_ssl` set to true enforce SSL encryption.

This option was introduced in 4.043 version of DBD::mysql. Due to [The BACKRONYM](http://backronym.fail/) and [The Riddle](http://riddle.link/) vulnerabilities in libmysqlclient library, enforcement of SSL encryption was not possbile and therefore `mysql_ssl_optional=1` was effectively set for all DBD::mysql versions prior to 4.043. Starting with 4.043, DBD::mysql with `mysql_ssl=1` could refuse connection to MySQL server if underlaying libmysqlclient library is vulnerable. Option `mysql_ssl_optional` can be used to make SSL connection vulnerable.

mysql\_server\_pubkey

Path to the RSA public key of the server. This is used for the sha256\_password and caching\_sha2\_password authentication plugins.

mysql\_get\_server\_pubkey

Setting `mysql_get_server_pubkey` to true requests the public RSA key of the server.

mysql\_local\_infile

The LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA may be disabled in the MySQL client library by default. If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_local\_infile=1", LOAD DATA LOCAL will be enabled. (However, this option is \*ineffective\* if the server has also been configured to disallow LOCAL.)

mysql\_multi\_statements

Support for multiple statements separated by a semicolon (;) may be enabled by using this option. Enabling this option may cause problems if server-side prepared statements are also enabled.

mysql\_server\_prepare

This option is used to enable server side prepared statements.

To use server side prepared statements, all you need to do is set the variable mysql\_server\_prepare in the connect:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost;mysql_server_prepare=1",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1 }
);
```

or:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1, mysql_server_prepare => 1 }
);
```

There are many benefits to using server side prepare statements, mostly if you are performing many inserts because of that fact that a single statement is prepared to accept multiple insert values.

To make sure that the 'make test' step tests whether server prepare works, you just need to export the env variable MYSQL\_SERVER\_PREPARE:

```
export MYSQL_SERVER_PREPARE=1
```

Please note that mysql server cannot prepare or execute some prepared statements. In this case DBD::mysql fallbacks to normal non-prepared statement and tries again.

mysql\_server\_prepare\_disable\_fallback

This option disable fallback to normal non-prepared statement when mysql server does not support execution of current statement as prepared.

Useful when you want to be sure that statement is going to be executed as server side prepared. Error message and code in case of failure is propagated back to DBI.

mysql\_conn\_attrs

The option <mysql\_conn\_attrs> is a hash of attribute names and values which can be used to send custom connection attributes to the server. Some attributes like '\_os', '\_platform', '\_client\_name' and '\_client\_version' are added by libmysqlclient and 'program\_name' is added by DBD::mysql.

You can then later read these attributes from the performance schema tables which can be quite helpful for profiling your database or creating statistics.

```
my $dbh= DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password,
  { AutoCommit => 0,
    mysql_conn_attrs => {
      foo => 'bar',
      wiz => 'bang'
    },
  });
```

Now you can select the results from the performance schema tables. You can do this in the same session, but also afterwards. It can be very useful to answer questions like 'which script sent this query?'.

```
my $results = $dbh->selectall_hashref(
  'SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_connect_attrs',
  'ATTR_NAME'
);
```

This returns:

```
$result = {
  'foo' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bar',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'foo',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '6'
  },
  'wiz' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bang',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'wiz',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '3'
  },
  'program_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => './foo.pl',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'program_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '5'
  },
  '_client_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'libmysql',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '1'
  },
  '_client_version' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '5.6.24',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_version',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '7'
  },
  '_os' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'osx10.8',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_os',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '0'
  },
  '_pid' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '59860',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_pid',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '2'
  },
  '_platform' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'x86_64',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_platform',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '4'
  }
};
```

# DATABASE HANDLES

The DBD::mysql driver supports the following attributes of database handles (read only):

```
$errno = $dbh->{'mysql_errno'};
$error = $dbh->{'mysql_error'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_hostinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_info'};
$insertid = $dbh->{'mysql_insertid'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_protoinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_serverinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_stat'};
$threadId = $dbh->{'mysql_thread_id'};
```

These correspond to mysql\_errno(), mysql\_error(), mysql\_get\_host\_info(), mysql\_info(), mysql\_insert\_id(), mysql\_get\_proto\_info(), mysql\_get\_server\_info(), mysql\_stat() and mysql\_thread\_id(), respectively.

mysql\_clientinfo

List information of the MySQL client library that DBD::mysql was built against:

```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientinfo}\n";

8.3.0
```

mysql\_clientversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_serverversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_serverversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_dbd\_stats
```
$info_hashref = $dbh->{mysql_dbd_stats};
```

DBD::mysql keeps track of some statistics in the mysql\_dbd\_stats attribute. The following stats are being maintained:

auto\_reconnects\_ok

The number of times that DBD::mysql successfully reconnected to the mysql server.

auto\_reconnects\_failed

The number of times that DBD::mysql tried to reconnect to mysql but failed.

The DBD::mysql driver also supports the following attributes of database handles (read/write):

mysql\_auto\_reconnect

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql will automatically reconnect to mysql if the connection be lost. This feature defaults to off; however, if either the GATEWAY\_INTERFACE or MOD\_PERL environment variable is set, DBD::mysql will turn mysql\_auto\_reconnect on. Setting mysql\_auto\_reconnect to on is not advised if 'lock tables' is used because if DBD::mysql reconnect to mysql all table locks will be lost. This attribute is ignored when AutoCommit is turned off, and when AutoCommit is turned off, DBD::mysql will not automatically reconnect to the server.

It is also possible to set the default value of the `mysql_auto_reconnect` attribute for the $dbh by passing it in the `\%attr` hash for `DBI-`connect>.

```
$dbh->{mysql_auto_reconnect} = 1;
```

or

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password, {
   mysql_auto_reconnect => 1,
});
```

Note that if you are using a module or framework that performs reconnections for you (for example [DBIx::Connector](/pod/DBIx%3A%3AConnector) in fixup mode), this value must be set to 0.

mysql\_use\_result

This attribute forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. mysql\_store\_result is the default due to that fact storing the result is expected behavior with most applications.

It is possible to set the default value of the `mysql_use_result` attribute for the $dbh via the DSN:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:test;mysql_use_result=1", "root", "");
```

You can also set it after creation of the database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 0; # disable
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 1; # enable
```

You can also set or unset the `mysql_use_result` setting on your statement handle, when creating the statement handle or after it has been created. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES).

mysql\_enable\_utf8

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql should assume strings stored in the database are utf8. This feature defaults to off.

When set, a data retrieved from a textual column type (char, varchar, etc) will have the UTF-8 flag turned on if necessary. This enables character semantics on that string. You will also need to ensure that your database / table / column is configured to use UTF8. See for more information the chapter on character set support in the MySQL manual: <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset.html>

Additionally, turning on this flag tells MySQL that incoming data should be treated as UTF-8. This will only take effect if used as part of the call to connect(). If you turn the flag on after connecting, you will need to issue the command `SET NAMES utf8` to get the same effect.

This flag's implementation suffers the "Unicode Bug" on passed statements and input bind parameters, and cannot be fixed for historical reasons. In order to pass strings with Unicode characters consistently through DBD::mysql, you can use a "hack" workaround of calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function on scalars immediately before passing them to DBD::mysql. Calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function has absolutely no effect on (correctly written) Perl code, but forces DBD::mysql to interpret it correctly as text data to be encoded. In the same way, binary (byte) data can be passed through DBD::mysql without being encoded as text data by calling the `utf8::downgrade()` function (it dies on wide Unicode strings with codepoints above U+FF). See the following example:

```
# check that last name contains LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH STROKE (U+D8)
my $statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name LIKE '%\x{D8}%' AND first_name = ? AND data = ?";

my $wide_string_param = "Andr\x{E9}"; # Andre with LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+E9)

my $byte_param = "\x{D8}\x{A0}\x{39}\x{F8}"; # some bytes (binary data)

my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:database', 'username', 'pass', { mysql_enable_utf8mb4 => 1 });

utf8::upgrade($statement); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement);

utf8::upgrade($wide_string_param); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(1, $wide_string_param);

utf8::downgrade($byte_param); # byte fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(2, $byte_param, DBI::SQL_BINARY); # set correct binary type

$sth->execute();

my $output = $sth->fetchall_arrayref();
# returned data in $output reference should be already UTF-8 decoded as appropriate
```

mysql\_enable\_utf8mb4

This is similar to mysql\_enable\_utf8, but is capable of handling 4-byte UTF-8 characters.

mysql\_bind\_type\_guessing

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) to attempt to guess if a value being bound is a numeric value, and if so, doesn't quote the value. This was created by Dragonchild and is one way to deal with the performance issue of using quotes in a statement that is inserting or updating a large numeric value. This was previously called `unsafe_bind_type_guessing` because it is experimental. I have successfully run the full test suite with this option turned on, the name can now be simply `mysql_bind_type_guessing`.

CAVEAT: Even though you can insert an integer value into a character column, if this column is indexed, if you query that column with the integer value not being quoted, it will not use the index:

```
mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = '3' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ref
possible_keys: value0
          key: value0
      key_len: 13
          ref: const
         rows: 1
        Extra: Using index condition
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = 3
    -> \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ALL
possible_keys: value0
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 6
        Extra: Using where
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

See bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43822

`mysql_bind_type_guessing` can be turned on via

```
- through DSN

 my $dbh= DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
 { mysql_bind_type_guessing => 1})

 - OR after handle creation

 $dbh->{mysql_bind_type_guessing} = 1;
```

mysql\_bind\_comment\_placeholders

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) will cause any placeholders in comments to be bound. This is not correct prepared statement behavior, but some developers have come to depend on this behavior, so I have made it available in 4.015

mysql\_no\_autocommit\_cmd

This attribute causes the driver to not issue 'set autocommit' either through explicit or using mysql\_autocommit(). This is particularly useful in the case of using MySQL Proxy.

See the bug report:

https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46308

`mysql_no_autocommit_cmd` can be turned on when creating the database handle:

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
{ mysql_no_autocommit_cmd => 1});
```

or using an existing database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_no_autocommit_cmd} = 1;
```

ping

This can be used to send a ping to the server.

```
$rc = $dbh->ping();
```

# STATEMENT HANDLES

The statement handles of DBD::mysql support a number of attributes. You access these by using, for example,

```
my $numFields = $sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
```

Note, that most attributes are valid only after a successful *execute*. An `undef` value will returned otherwise. The most important exception is the `mysql_use_result` attribute, which forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. (That's why mysql\_store\_result is the default.)

To set the `mysql_use_result` attribute, use either of the following:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("QUERY", { mysql_use_result => 1});
```

or

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
$sth->{mysql_use_result} = 1;
```

Column dependent attributes, for example *NAME*, the column names, are returned as a reference to an array. The array indices are corresponding to the indices of the arrays returned by *fetchrow* and similar methods. For example the following code will print a header of table names together with all rows:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table") ||
  die "Error:" . $dbh->errstr . "\n";

$sth->execute ||  die "Error:" . $sth->errstr . "\n";

my $names = $sth->{NAME};
my $numFields = $sth->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'} - 1;
for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$names[$i]);
}
print "\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref) {
    for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$ref[$i]);
    }
    print "\n";
}
```

For portable applications you should restrict yourself to attributes with capitalized or mixed case names. Uppercase attribute names are in the statement handle interface described by [DBI](/pod/DBI), while lower case attribute names are private to DBD::mysql. The attribute list includes:

NAME

A reference to an array of column names, as per DBI docs.

NULLABLE

A reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that this column may contain NULL's.

NUM\_OF\_FIELDS

Number of fields returned by a *SELECT* or *LISTFIELDS* statement. You may use this for checking whether a statement returned a result: A zero value indicates a non-SELECT statement like *INSERT*, *DELETE* or *UPDATE*.

TYPE

A reference to an array of column types. The engine's native column types are mapped to portable types like DBI::SQL\_INTEGER() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(), as good as possible. Not all native types have a meaningful equivalent, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_INTERVAL is mapped to DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(). If you need the native column types, use *mysql\_type*. See below.

ChopBlanks

this attribute determines whether a *fetchrow* will chop preceding and trailing blanks off the column values. Chopping blanks does not have impact on the *max\_length* attribute.

ParamValues

This attribute is supported as described in the DBI documentation.

It returns a hashref, the keys of which are the 'names' of the placeholders: integers starting at 1. It returns an empty hashref if the statement has no placeholders.

The values for these keys are initially undef; they are populated with `bind_param`, or when `execute` method is called with parameters. (Supplying the parameter values in the arguments to `execute` will override any previously bound values.)

After execution, it is possible to use `bind_param` to change a single parameter value and `execute` the statement again, with other values unchanged. The attribute remains properly populated after the `finish` method is called, with the values from the last execution.

mysql\_gtids

Returns GTID(s) if GTID session tracking is ensabled in the server via session\_track\_gtids.

mysql\_insertid

If the statement you executed performs an INSERT, and there is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column in the table you inserted in, this attribute holds the value stored into the AUTO\_INCREMENT column, if that value is automatically generated, by storing NULL or 0 or was specified as an explicit value.

Typically, you'd access the value via $sth->{mysql\_insertid}. The value can also be accessed via $dbh->{mysql\_insertid} but this can easily produce incorrect results in case one database handle is shared.

mysql\_is\_blob

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a blob. This attribute is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a key. This is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_num

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column contains numeric values.

mysql\_is\_pri\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a primary key.

mysql\_is\_auto\_increment

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that the respective column is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column. This is only valid for MySQL.

mysql\_length

mysql\_max\_length

A reference to an array of maximum column sizes. The *max\_length* is the maximum physically present in the result table, *length* gives the theoretically possible maximum. *max\_length* is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_table

A reference to an array of table names, useful in a *JOIN* result.

mysql\_type

A reference to an array of MySQL's native column types, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_SHORT() or DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_STRING(). Use the *TYPE* attribute, if you want portable types like DBI::SQL\_SMALLINT() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR().

mysql\_type\_name

Similar to mysql, but type names and not numbers are returned. Whenever possible, the ANSI SQL name is preferred.

mysql\_warning\_count

The number of warnings generated during execution of the SQL statement. This attribute is available on both statement handles and database handles.

# TRANSACTION SUPPORT

The transaction support works as follows:

* By default AutoCommit mode is on, following the DBI specifications.
* If you execute

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  ```

  or

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 1;
  ```

  then the driver will set the MySQL server variable autocommit to 0 or 1, respectively. Switching from 0 to 1 will also issue a COMMIT, following the DBI specifications.
* The methods

  ```
  $dbh->rollback();
  $dbh->commit();
  ```

  will issue the commands ROLLBACK and COMMIT, respectively. A ROLLBACK will also be issued if AutoCommit mode is off and the database handles DESTROY method is called. Again, this is following the DBI specifications.

Given the above, you should note the following:

* You should never change the server variable autocommit manually, unless you are ignoring DBI's transaction support.
* Switching AutoCommit mode from on to off or vice versa may fail. You should always check for errors when changing AutoCommit mode. The suggested way of doing so is using the DBI flag RaiseError. If you don't like RaiseError, you have to use code like the following:

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  if ($dbh->{AutoCommit}) {
    # An error occurred!
  }
  ```
* If you detect an error while changing the AutoCommit mode, you should no longer use the database handle. In other words, you should disconnect and reconnect again, because the transaction mode is unpredictable. Alternatively you may verify the transaction mode by checking the value of the server variable autocommit. However, such behaviour isn't portable.
* DBD::mysql has a "reconnect" feature that handles the so-called MySQL "morning bug": If the server has disconnected, most probably due to a timeout, then by default the driver will reconnect and attempt to execute the same SQL statement again. However, this behaviour is disabled when AutoCommit is off: Otherwise the transaction state would be completely unpredictable after a reconnect.
* The "reconnect" feature of DBD::mysql can be toggled by using the [mysql\_auto\_reconnect](/pod/mysql_auto_reconnect) attribute. This behaviour should be turned off in code that uses LOCK TABLE because if the database server time out and DBD::mysql reconnect, table locks will be lost without any indication of such loss.

# MULTIPLE RESULT SETS

DBD::mysql supports multiple result sets, thanks to Guy Harrison!

The basic usage of multiple result sets is

```
do
{
  while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array())
  {
    do stuff;
  }
} while ($sth->more_results)
```

An example would be:

```
$dbh->do("drop procedure if exists someproc") or print $DBI::errstr;

$dbh->do("create procedure someproc() deterministic
 begin
 declare a,b,c,d int;
 set a=1;
 set b=2;
 set c=3;
 set d=4;
 select a, b, c, d;
 select d, c, b, a;
 select b, a, c, d;
 select c, b, d, a;
end") or print $DBI::errstr;

$sth=$dbh->prepare('call someproc()') ||
die $DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr;

$sth->execute || die DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr; $rowset=0;
do {
  print "\nRowset ".++$i."\n---------------------------------------\n\n";
  foreach $colno (0..$sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS}-1) {
    print $sth->{NAME}->[$colno]."\t";
  }
  print "\n";
  while (@row= $sth->fetchrow_array())  {
    foreach $field (0..$#row) {
      print $row[$field]."\t";
    }
    print "\n";
  }
} until (!$sth->more_results)
```
## Issues with multiple result sets

Please be aware there could be issues if your result sets are "jagged", meaning the number of columns of your results vary. Varying numbers of columns could result in your script crashing.

# MULTITHREADING

The multithreading capabilities of DBD::mysql depend completely on the underlying C libraries. The modules are working with handle data only, no global variables are accessed or (to the best of my knowledge) thread unsafe functions are called. Thus DBD::mysql is believed to be completely thread safe, if the C libraries are thread safe and you don't share handles among threads.

The obvious question is: Are the C libraries thread safe? In the case of MySQL the answer is yes, since MySQL 5.5 it is.

# ASYNCHRONOUS QUERIES

You can make a single asynchronous query per MySQL connection; this allows you to submit a long-running query to the server and have an event loop inform you when it's ready. An asynchronous query is started by either setting the 'async' attribute to a true value in the ["do" in DBI](/pod/DBI#do) method, or in the ["prepare" in DBI](/pod/DBI#prepare) method. Statements created with 'async' set to true in prepare always run their queries asynchronously when ["execute" in DBI](/pod/DBI#execute) is called. The driver also offers three additional methods: `mysql_async_result`, `mysql_async_ready`, and `mysql_fd`. `mysql_async_result` returns what do or execute would have; that is, the number of rows affected. `mysql_async_ready` returns true if `mysql_async_result` will not block, and zero otherwise. They both return `undef` if that handle was not created with 'async' set to true or if an asynchronous query was not started yet. `mysql_fd` returns the file descriptor number for the MySQL connection; you can use this in an event loop.

Here's an example of how to use the asynchronous query interface:

```
use feature 'say';
$dbh->do('SELECT SLEEP(10)', { async => 1 });
until($dbh->mysql_async_ready) {
  say 'not ready yet!';
  sleep 1;
}
my $rows = $dbh->mysql_async_result;
```
# INSTALLATION

See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod).

# AUTHORS

Originally, there was a non-DBI driver, Mysql, which was much like PHP drivers such as mysql and mysqli. The **Mysql** module was originally written by Andreas König <koenig@kulturbox.de> who still, to this day, contributes patches to DBD::mysql. An emulated version of Mysql was provided to DBD::mysql from Jochen Wiedmann, but eventually deprecated as it was another bundle of code to maintain.

The first incarnation of DBD::mysql was developed by Alligator Descartes, who was also aided and abetted by Gary Shea, Andreas König and Tim Bunce.

The current incarnation of **DBD::mysql** was written by Jochen Wiedmann, then numerous changes and bug-fixes were added by Rudy Lippan. Next, prepared statement support was added by Patrick Galbraith and Alexy Stroganov (who also solely added embedded server support).

For the past nine years DBD::mysql has been maintained by Patrick Galbraith (*patg@patg.net*), and recently with the great help of Michiel Beijen (*michiel.beijen@gmail.com*), along with the entire community of Perl developers who keep sending patches to help continue improving DBD::mysql
