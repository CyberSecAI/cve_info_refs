Package: most
Version: 5.0.0a-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole

Hello,

the most pager can automatically open files compressed with gzip,
bzip2 and (in Debian) LZMA.

This is done using popen() and, in earlier releases of most, it was
vulnerable to a shell injection attack.

most fixed this in v5.0.0 (released in 2007), but the Debian patch
that added LZMA support (bug #466574) remains vulnerable.

It is trivial to generate a file with a certain name and content that,
when opened with most, runs arbitrary commands in the user's computer.

most is also launched by other programs as a pager for text files
(example: an e-mail client that needs to open an attachment). If any
of those programs generates a temporary file name that can be set by
an attacker, then that can be used to break into the user's machine.
I don't have any example of such program, however.

All versions of most >= 5.0.0a-1 including 5.0.0a-2.5 in Debian
(and derivatives that include the LZMA patch) are vulnerable (older
versions are vulnerable in all distros as I explained earlier).

   <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1253>

I'm attaching the debdiff with the patch. It simply replaces single
quotes with double quotes in the command passed to popen(). Double
quotes in the filename are escaped by most in order to prevent this
kind of attacks, but this offers no protection if the file name is
enclosed in single quotes.

Regards,

Berto

Version        : 5.0.0a-2.2
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-1253
Debian Bug     : 848132

The most pager can automatically open files compressed with gzip,
bzip2 and (in Debian) LZMA. Alberto Garcia discovered that Debian's
version of most was susceptible for a shell injection attack that
could be exploited to run arbitrary commands on the user's computer.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
5.0.0a-2.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your most packages.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Subject: most is vulnerable to a shell injection attack using LZMA-compressed files
Date: Wed, 14 Dec 2016 14:49:44 +0200
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=848132;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]

Package: most
Version: 5.0.0a-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole

Hello,

the most pager can automatically open files compressed with gzip,
bzip2 and (in Debian) LZMA.

This is done using popen() and, in earlier releases of most, it was
vulnerable to a shell injection attack.

most fixed this in v5.0.0 (released in 2007), but the Debian patch
that added LZMA support (bug #466574) remains vulnerable.

It is trivial to generate a file with a certain name and content that,
when opened with most, runs arbitrary commands in the user's computer.

most is also launched by other programs as a pager for text files
(example: an e-mail client that needs to open an attachment). If any
of those programs generates a temporary file name that can be set by
an attacker, then that can be used to break into the user's machine.
I don't have any example of such program, however.

All versions of most >= 5.0.0a-1 including 5.0.0a-2.5 in Debian
(and derivatives that include the LZMA patch) are vulnerable (older
versions are vulnerable in all distros as I explained earlier).

   <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1253>

I'm attaching the debdiff with the patch. It simply replaces single
quotes with double quotes in the command passed to popen(). Double
quotes in the filename are escaped by most in order to prevent this
kind of attacks, but this offers no protection if the file name is
enclosed in single quotes.

Regards,

Berto
