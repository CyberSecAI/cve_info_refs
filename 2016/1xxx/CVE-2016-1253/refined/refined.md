Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `most` pager program uses `popen()` to open compressed files.
- The Debian patch that added LZMA support introduced a vulnerability by using single quotes in the `popen()` command for LZMA-compressed files, while double quotes were used for other compression types (gzip, bzip2).
- Double quotes are escaped by `most`, but single quotes are not, which allows an attacker to inject shell commands through the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Shell Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands through a specially crafted filename. The `most` program does not properly sanitize filenames when handling LZMA-compressed files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine. This allows for a complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Filenames:** An attacker can create a specially crafted LZMA-compressed file with a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters. When a user opens this file with `most`, the injected commands are executed.
- **Indirect Exploitation through other applications:** If a vulnerable version of `most` is used by other programs to display text files (such as email clients previewing attachments), an attacker might be able to exploit this vulnerability via a malicious filename provided through those applications, assuming the filename can be influenced by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create an LZMA-compressed file with a controlled filename.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious file using the vulnerable `most` pager. This could be direct opening by the user, or indirectly via another program.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced when LZMA support was added to the Debian package of `most`.
- The fix involves replacing the single quotes with double quotes in the `popen()` command for LZMA decompression.
- The vulnerability is present in Debian Wheezy before version 5.0.0a-2.2, Debian Jessie before 5.0.0a-2.3+deb8u1, and Debian unstable before 5.0.0a-3.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2016-1253.
