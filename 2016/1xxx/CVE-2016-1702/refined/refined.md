    "description": "The SkRegion::readFromMemory function in core/SkRegion.cpp in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.79, does not validate the interval count, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted serialized data.",

      "root_cause": "The SkRegion::readFromMemory function in Skia does not validate the interval count when reading data from memory during deserialization.",
