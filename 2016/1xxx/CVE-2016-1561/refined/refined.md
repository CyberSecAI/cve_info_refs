Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1561 (Based on the rapid7 database entry referencing "ExaGrid Known SSH Key and Default Password")

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* ExaGrid ships backup appliances with a pre-installed public/private SSH key pair intended for passwordless authentication between ExaGrid appliances.
* The private key is easily retrievable by an attacker.
* The default root password is also known to be 'inflection'.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The use of a default, easily obtainable SSH private key.
*   **Default Password:** The use of a default password for the root user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Remote Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized remote access as root to affected ExaGrid appliances.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  With root access, an attacker can perform any action on the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target ExaGrid appliance to connect via SSH.
*   **Exploitation of Weak Credentials:** The attacker uses the known private key and/or the default password to gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target ExaGrid appliance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default private key and/or the default root password.
*   **SSH Client:** The attacker needs an SSH client capable of using a private key or basic password authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Rapid7 information also includes a Metasploit module that can be used to exploit this vulnerability, showcasing the potential impact.
