#### Rapid7 Vulnerability & Exploit Database

# ExaGrid Known SSH Key and Default Password

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### ExaGrid Known SSH Key and Default Password

Disclosed
04/07/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

ExaGrid ships a public/private key pair on their backup appliances to
allow passwordless authentication to other ExaGrid appliances. Since
the private key is easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain
unauthorized remote access as root. Additionally, this module will
attempt to use the default password for root, 'inflection'.

#### Author(s)

* egypt <egypt@metasploit.com>

#### Platform

Unix

#### Architectures

cmd

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/linux/ssh/exagrid_known_privkey.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/linux/ssh/exagrid_known_privkey.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/linux/ssh/exagrid_known_privkey
msf exploit(exagrid_known_privkey) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(exagrid_known_privkey) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(exagrid_known_privkey) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(exagrid_known_privkey) > exploit
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Collect and share all the information you need to conduct a successful and efficient penetration test](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

[Free Metasploit Pro Trial](/try/metasploit-pro/)
[View All Features](/products/metasploit/features/)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

– Jim O’Gorman | President, Offensive Security
