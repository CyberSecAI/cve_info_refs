**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the web framework of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is an information disclosure vulnerability. The web framework does not properly handle certain requests, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to view sensitive data. The impact is rated as "Partial" for Integrity, meaning an attacker could modify some system files or information, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. There is no impact on Confidentiality or Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is "Network" (AV:N), meaning the vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated (Au:S) to exploit the vulnerability. This means the attacker must have valid login credentials to the affected Cisco UCM system. Additionally, the attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning no special conditions or user interaction are needed.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager Release 11.5(0.98000.480) is specifically identified as vulnerable.
*   **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to fixed software.
*   **Exploit Availability:** Functional exploit code (E:F) is available.
*   **Remediation Level:** The remediation level is "Unavailable" (RL:U), indicating there is no official fix or workaround yet.
*   **Report Confidence:** The report confidence is "Confirmed" (RC:C), meaning the vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor.
*   **CVSS Score:** Base score is 4.0, and temporal score is 3.8. The vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C

The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
