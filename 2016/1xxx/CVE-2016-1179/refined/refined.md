Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found within the standard template of the comment functionality of the a-blog cms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data within the comment feature's template, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the web browsers of users visiting the affected website.
*   **Potential for Malicious Activities:** This could allow attackers to perform a variety of malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (Remote):** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the internet.
*   **Comment Functionality:** The vulnerability is present in the standard template used for displaying comments, indicating that an attacker could inject malicious scripts through the comment submission process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Specific Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:**  The user interaction is required, as the user has to visit a page where the malicious script is rendered.
*   **Knowledge of Comment Functionality:** The attacker needs to know how to submit comments on the affected website to inject the malicious payload.
