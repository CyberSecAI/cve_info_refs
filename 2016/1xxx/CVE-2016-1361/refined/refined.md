Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the ASIC UDP ingress receive function of Cisco Gigabit Switch Router (GSR) 12000 Series Routers. An unexpected line card restart triggers the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of UDP packets during a specific event (line card restart) leading to a denial of service.
- The issue is within the ASIC UDP ingress receive function, pointing to a low-level processing flaw.
- Vulnerability classified as CWE-399 which is a Resource Management Error

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a partial Denial of Service (DoS). The router will experience a partial service disruption. This is caused by the unexpected restart of a line card within the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted UDP packets to the affected router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within the same network segment as the vulnerable Cisco GSR 12000 series router.
-  The attacker does not need any authentication (Au:N).
- The attacker needs to be capable of crafting and sending the specific UDP packets that trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker requires high knowledge of the target system as the exploit is classified as high complexity (AC:H)
