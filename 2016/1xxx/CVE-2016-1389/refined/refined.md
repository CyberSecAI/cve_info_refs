Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-1389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies within the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server (CWMS) web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*  The vulnerability is an open redirect. This means the system allows an attacker to craft a URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to an arbitrary, potentially malicious website.
* The specific weakness is related to improper input validation (CWE-20), allowing the attacker to control the redirection target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated, remote attacker can redirect a user to an undesired web page.
* This could be used in phishing attacks to steal user credentials or install malware on the user's system by redirecting to a malicious site that resembles a legitimate one.
* The impact is on integrity as it allows for modification of the expected user experience and can lead to further exploitation, not just the act of redirection.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing local access to the system.
* The attack requires medium complexity (AC:M), indicating that some specialized access conditions are present.
* No authentication is required for exploitation (Au:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted URL to a user of the vulnerable CWMS. The attacker must know where to send these crafted links, whether directly or through other means (e.g., email, instant messaging, social media).
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have special privileges.
