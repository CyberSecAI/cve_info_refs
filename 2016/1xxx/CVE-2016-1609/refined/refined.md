It provides details about a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Micro Focus (formerly Novell) Filr.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Filr web interface uses a blacklist filter to strip JavaScript code from user input, but this filter can be bypassed.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the Filr web interface, which is then executed by other users who view the profile where the malicious code was injected. This could lead to session compromise or other attacks on the targeted users' browsers.\n- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious Javascript into the phone field of a user profile.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and have the ability to modify user profile information. The injected script is then executed by any user viewing the profile (e.g. admins)."
