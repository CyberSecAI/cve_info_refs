It's the same included in yast2-users 3.1.41.3 package. ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=974220#c25)  Imobach Gonzalez Sosa   2016-04-14 09:10:24 UTC  ``` Thanks Marcus.  This is the SR for the new package: <https://build.suse.de/request/show/110728>  Just to summarize:  * The bug appears when the AutoYaST profile does not contain inst-sys users (bin, daemon, lp, etc.). If those users are declared in the profile (the default behavior for "yast2 clone_system"), the bug will not be triggered.  * yast2-users 3.1.41.3 fixes the issue (if it's used as a DUD). If it's installed in a affected system, it will also fix the problem.  * Caveat: after releasing yast2-users 3.1.41.3, there's a problematic scenario: if "install_updates" option is enabled in the profile, the bug will appear again (because yast2-users 3.1.41.3 will be installed before the installation is finished and the users are written). Reinstalling yast2-users will fix the problem (or running the script on [comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=974220#c24)). ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=974220#c26)  Johannes Segitz   2016-04-18 09:42:04 UTC  ``` Fix for issue is in YaST:Head and openSUSE:Factory, so it is public ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=974220#c27)  jun wang   2016-04-20 09:41:45 UTC  ``` I am testing yast2-users package.

This is the SR for the new package: <https://build.suse.de/request/show/110728>  Just to summarize:  * The bug appears when the AutoYaST profile does not contain inst-sys users (bin, daemon, lp, etc.). If those users are declared in the profile (the default behavior for "yast2 clone_system"), the bug will not be triggered.  * yast2-users 3.1.41.3 fixes the issue (if it's used as a DUD). If it's installed in a affected system, it will also fix the problem.  * Caveat: after releasing yast2-users 3.1.41.3, there's a problematic scenario: if "install_updates" option is enabled in the profile, the bug will appear again (because yast2-users 3.1.41.3 will be installed before the installation is finished and the users are written). Reinstalling yast2-users will fix the problem (or running the script on [comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=974220#c24)). ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=974220#c26)  Johannes Segitz   2016-04-18 09:42:04 UTC  ``` Fix for issue is in YaST:Head and openSUSE:Factory, so it is public ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=974220#c27)  jun wang   2016-04-20 09:41:45 UTC  ``` I am testing yast2-users package.

I've tried these scenarios:  * AutoYaST installation adding yast2-users to a Driver Update Disk. * AutoYaST installation using the original SLE12 SP1 DVD. After that, I've installed yast2-users-3.1.41.3-9.1.x86_64.rpm with zypper.  In both cases it worked for me. So, please, could you attach YaST2 logs so we can have a closer look?

And make sure it works well with a dud. this fix is fine.
