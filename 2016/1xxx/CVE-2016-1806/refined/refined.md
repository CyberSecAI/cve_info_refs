Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `com.apple.SubmitDiagInfo` service failing to properly validate a user-supplied path before creating a directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The service does not validate the path provided by the user, allowing an attacker to control the directory creation location.
- Arbitrary Directory Creation: This lack of validation allows the attacker to create directories at arbitrary locations on the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code as root.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By creating directories in specific locations, an attacker can potentially overwrite files or create files that lead to the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
- User Interaction: The target user must interact with a malicious page or open a malicious file. This suggests the attack might involve social engineering or delivering a specially crafted file or webpage to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the target system.
- Ability to craft malicious content (e.g., a web page or a file) that can trigger the vulnerability in the `com.apple.SubmitDiagInfo` service.
- Some level of user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported by "lokihardt" and was part of the Pwn2Own competition.
- Apple released a security update to address the vulnerability.
