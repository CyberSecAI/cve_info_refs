Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-1398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W routers.
- This is triggered by a crafted HTTP request, indicating a lack of proper input validation or boundary checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-119:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
- Buffer overflow in the processing of HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the web-based management interface.
- The attack can be launched remotely (over the network), if remote management is enabled. Otherwise, it can be triggered locally through the LAN interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be authenticated to the web-based management interface, which means they need valid credentials. This is indicated by the CVSS vector "Au:S" (Authentication: Single).
- The attacker can be located remotely if remote management is enabled, otherwise, they must be on the same LAN.
- The exploit requires sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all releases of the Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W routers.
- The remote management feature is disabled by default, which reduces the attack surface.
- The vendor, Cisco, is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
- A functional exploit (E:F) is available.
- There are no available workarounds.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researcher Samuel Huntley.
