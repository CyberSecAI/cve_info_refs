# Latest Security Release Not Included In Security Repo?

Asked by
[Andrew Killen](https://launchpad.net/~andrewbkillen)
on 2024-10-03

I am running Focal Fossa and noticed that AppArmor was vulnerable (CVE-2016-1585). My automatic upgrade attempts were not upgrading from the vulnerable version 2.13.3-7ubuntu5.3build2 to the latest version 2.13.3-7ubuntu5.4. When investigating further it is because my systems are configured to only pull updates out of the security repository, which does not include this update.

My thought is that there is potentially some sort of lag between releasing to Updates and then Security, but I haven't found any confirmation of this. Will this update eventually be included in the Security repository? If so, is there documentation on how those decision are made (for my own edification)? If not, why not?

Thank you,

Andrew

As far as I can see from [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apparmor](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apparmor) the new version has only been published to -updates, but not to -security, although being marked as fixing a security-related bug.

This is not in line with <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Install_updates_from%3A>

The same is valid also for Ubuntu jammy.

I suggest that you create a comment on the bug report linked above,

Bernard, yes that does complete the upgrade since I have non-security repositories configured on these systems. The reason for my question though was that we have systems that have automated patching configured that only pulls from the security repository to reduce the volume of changes while also staying up to date with security patching.

Manfred, I appreciate the link and suggestion to comment on the bug I linked in this question. I wasn't sure of my understanding on what belongs in the security repository, but your documentation reinforces that something is not right here. I will mark this as problem solved here and follow up in the bug thread.

Thank you both!

### Bug Description

[Impact]

\* The mount rules in apparmor grant excessive permissions.

   See Original Report below.

[Test Plan]

\* <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Process/Merges/TestPlans/AppArmor>

   See comment 26 for context.

[Other Info]

SRU Team; the packages for focal-proposed and jammy-proposed are intended as security updates prepared by the Ubuntu Security team (and have built in a ppa with only the security pockets enabled). However, because the fix makes mount rules in apparmor policy be treated more restrictively than they were prior to this update, we would like these packages to gain more widespread testing.

[Risk of Regression]

The update for this issue causes the apparmor parser, the tool that translates written policy into the enforcement data structures used by the kernel, to generate more strict policy for mount rules, like the example below. They are not common in apparmor policy generally, but can appear in policies written for container managers to restrict containers, and thus can potentially break container startup.

The packages prepared for focal-proposed and jammy-proposed have tested with the versions of snapd, lxc, libvirt, and docker in the ubuntu archive, but container managers outside of the ubuntu archive may run into issues, hence the need for testing and policy adjustments.

Original Report:

The rule

  mount options=(rw,make-slave) -> \*\*,

ends up allowing

  mount -t proc proc /mnt

which it shouldn't as it should be restricted to commands with a make-slave flag

The parser is generating 2 match rules in the dfa off of the one text rule, they are the equivalent of

  mount options=(rw,make-slave) -> \*\*,

  mount options=rw,

this is due to how the parser is trying to share rule generation for generic rules that don't specify a flag, and rules that specify them. When flags aren't specified multiple rule sets may need to be generated but only one matching the flags should when the flags are specified.

I have a wip patch, but it hasn't been a priority lately. I do plan

on finishing up with it soon but atm the 4.13 backports for suse

are the current higher priority item blocking completion

Hello,

this is an old bug report but due to the assigned CVE it still shows up in Debian's security tracker.

<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1585>

Could someone elaborate on if and when this bug was resolved and point to relevant fixing commits. Any information about the nature of this bug and its impact on current Debian and Ubuntu releases would be appreciated.

Regards,

Markus

I was asked by a Debian security team member to share how much this is a concern for Debian. I'll do that here, even though this might be irrelevant for other distros, in the hope more knowledgeable folks can correct whatever I got wrong :)

The Debian Stretch kernel does not support mount rules so it's out of scope, except for users running a kernel from backports.

The Debian Buster kernel supports mount rules. AFAIK only two things use mount rules in Debian:

\* LXC: not a regression, since we've never confined LXC with AppArmor by default before Buster and Stretch's kernel has no support for mount rules IIRC; worst case, LXC guests on a Buster host are less strictly confined than we would like, which would be nice to fix, but we were very close to disable AppArmor for LXC during the freeze, so well.

\* libvirtd: no big deal, this profile is not meant to be a strong security boundary (libvirtd can do so much anyway), but rather as a way to start processes run by libvirtd under their own profile.

Adding to this that John discovered this almost 3y ago and did not prioritize fixing it, I would categorize this issue as unimportant for now in the context of Debian.

I'm coming from <https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/6799> where daemons inside containers are unable to get proper mount namespace setup due to what seems like an Apparmor bug (this one?).

Starting systemd-networkd inside a container (foo) will generate this:

apparmor="DENIED" operation="mount" info="failed flags match" error=-13 profile="lxd-foo\_</var/snap/lxd/common/lxd>" name="/run/systemd/unit-root/" pid=2338 comm="(networkd)" flags="ro, remount, noatime, bind"

this causes the entire FS tree as seen by systemd-networkd to remain read-write and visible. This is despite having the following restrictions supposedly applied:

$ systemctl cat systemd-networkd | grep -E 'Protect(Home|System)'

  ProtectSystem=strict

  ProtectHome=yes

ProtectSystem is supposed to have everything remounted as read-only and ProtectHome is supposed to make /home and /root inaccessible. None of this works and I find it worrying :/

The initial fixed was released in

apparmor 3.1.4

apparmor 3.0.10

apparmor 2.13.8

there were two sets of followup releases to deal with regression issues

Dear colleagues,

can you clarify when this updated AppArmor version appear in Ubuntu 22.04?

As I can see from <https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/apparmor> version is still AppArmor 3.0.4.

Kind regards,

Alex

@mihalicyn: Ubuntu does not generally updated to newer package versions during the life of a release. Instead they will backport fixes to the package version in the release. So 22.04 will remain on AppArmor 3.0.4 when the fixes land, but the Ubuntu version will change.

I can not say when the fix will land in Ubuntu 22.04 at this time but the backport and testing work is in progress.

Gentle ping.

JFYI: in the next LXC release 5.0.4 we will get a real security issue because of that, because we have merged a fix to make privileged containers to work (when new systemd is used).

<https://github.com/lxc/lxc/pull/4295>

Can we fix that in Jammy? We have everything for that we just need to backport the fix to Jammy and issue a new release of the package.

The mount fixes were backported to Jammy, AFAIK the only thing that was remaining to be done was publish them to the security pocket and publish the USN. I will look into where this is at

It is in the SRU queue and the current ETA is April 15 to land in the proposed pocket (archive proposed not security proposed ppa), there is a caveat that the recent xz backdoor has caused some "fun" on the archive side and could potentially cause some delays.

I'll leave it to someone else to decide if that's enough to mark it as `verification-done-jammy`.

Actual fixed versions for this issue are still sitting in focal-proposed and jammy-proposed. However, we did a no-change rebuild ofthe current versions in the respective updates pockets to the security pocket, so that the version in proposed could be published first in the updates pocket, but leaving people who experience possible issues the opportunity for an easy downgrade path to the prior version (via apt install apparmor/jammy-security or apparmor/focal-security as the case may be).

There are outdated autopkgtests (i.e., ran against reverse-test-deps that now have newer versions in -updates), which I triggered reruns for.

Once that looks good (hopefully during my shift today, or maybe tomorrow), I'll take a look for release.

Autopkgtests preventing migration look good now.

All have passed and cleared up in update\_excuses

(only libreoffice/jammy/armhf running; expecting

it to pass based on previous history and results

from same package/version in other architectures).

Proceeding with release to Jammy and Focal.

I am running Focal Fossa and noticed that AppArmor was vulnerable (CVE-2016-1585). My automatic upgrade attempts were not upgrading from the vulnerable version 2.13.3-7ubuntu5.3build2 to the latest version 2.13.3-7ubuntu5.4. When investigating further it is because my systems are configured to only pull updates out of the security repository, which does not include this update.

I posted a question in the general AppArmor area and it was suggested to bring this up in this specific bug thread. The thought is that the version released around this bug should be included in the security repository, not just the update repository. If this is indeed an issue, the same can be said for the jammy releases as well.

@Andrew: Simon is correct. This update deliberately had an unusual roll-out where it went to updates first so that it could be phased, and we could roll back if the phasing showed a problem.

The security pocket was not updated specifically to provide a users a way to easily revert the update.

As mentioned this state is only going to exist for a week (planned) or two, and then the update will be synced to the security pocket once we are sure the update has not caused significant issues.

Based on the linked thread the plan was to publish to the security repository last week, but I have my questions answered and will sit tight until that takes place. Appreciate your help!

## Notes

```
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/+bug/1597017](https://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/%2Bbug/1597017)
<https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=995594>
Introduced around AppArmor 2.8 upstream.
Mount rules support is enabled in Debian, but the impact of the issue is
limited to 1. lxc (not a regression, as Debian never confined LXC with AppArmor
by default before buster, in particular not with mount rules), 2. libvirtd
but the profile is not meant to be a strong security boundary.
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/+bug/1597017/comments/6](https://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/%2Bbug/1597017/comments/6)
<https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Release_Notes_3.0.10>
Fixed by: <https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/commit/262fd11359432888292952e5ed29bead5ace16f0> (v3.0.10)
Negligible security impact / known limitation
