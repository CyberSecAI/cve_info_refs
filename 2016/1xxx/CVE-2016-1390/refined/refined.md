Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1390:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module (NAM) and Cisco Prime Virtual Network Analysis Module (vNAM). Specifically, insufficient input validation or sanitization in the CLI allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying host operating system. This is a direct result of a lack of proper input validation in the CLI.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker can execute these commands with elevated privileges, meaning they can gain control of the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system with elevated privileges, leading to a complete compromise of the system. This includes control over the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Access: The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker.
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system's CLI to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the affected system.
- Authenticated User: The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the CLI of the Cisco Prime NAM or vNAM device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity, with a CVSS base score of 6.8 and a temporal score of 5.6.
- Cisco has released software updates and a security patch to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Daniel Jensen of Security-Assessment.com.
- There are no known public announcements or malicious exploitation of this vulnerability as of the advisory release date.
