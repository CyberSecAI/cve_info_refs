  "CVE-2016-1803": {
    "description": "A null pointer dereference was addressed through improved validation.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Apple Watch Sport",
      "Apple Watch",
      "Apple Watch Edition",
      "Apple Watch Hermes",
      "OS X El Capitan v10.11 and later",
      "Apple TV (4th generation)",
      "iPhone 4s and later",
      "iPod touch (5th generation) and later",
      "iPad 2 and later"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in CoreCaptureResponder due to unchecked return value from `stashGet` method.",
     "vulnerability": "The CoreCaptureUserClient's external methods call `CoreCaptureUserClient::stashGet` with an attacker-controlled key. If the key isn't found in the list of stashed objects, `stashGet` returns a NULL pointer. The callers of this method do not check the return value, resulting in a virtual method call on a NULL pointer.",
    "impact": "An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges or cause a denial of service (depending on the OS).",
    "attack_vector": "A local attacker can trigger the vulnerability by calling external methods of `CoreCaptureUserClient` with a crafted key. For OS X, user interaction is required in that the target must open a malicious file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target device. For OS X, the attacker must be able to make the user open a malicious file. For other operating systems, this can be achieved by a malicious application installed by the user.",
    "additional_information": "By mapping the NULL page, an attacker can gain trivial RIP control."
