Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1728:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a privacy issue in how WebKit CSS handles the "a:visited button" CSS selector when evaluating the height of the containing element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is a privacy vulnerability, where websites can potentially determine if a user has visited a specific link. This is achieved by exploiting how the CSS engine calculates the height when the visited pseudo-class is used on a button.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a privacy breach. Malicious websites can use this vulnerability to track a user's browsing history by checking which links have been visited.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through maliciously crafted websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host or inject malicious code onto a website that a target user will visit.
- The attacker needs to use the "a:visited button" CSS selector in a way that triggers the vulnerability.
- No special user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
