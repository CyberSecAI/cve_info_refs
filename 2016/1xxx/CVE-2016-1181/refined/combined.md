# JVN#03188560 Apache Struts 1 vulnerability that allows unintended remote operations against components on memory

## Overview

The Apache Sturts 1 ActionForm contains a vulnerability which allows unintended remote operations against components on server memory, such as Servlets and ClassLoader.

## Products Affected

* Apache Struts versions 1.0 through 1.3.10

## Description

The Apache Sturts 1 ActionForm contains a vulnerability which allows unintended remote operations against components on server memory, such as Servlets and ClassLoader, when the following 2 conditions are met:

**Condition 1:**
When the following ActionForm (including its subclasses) are in the session scope, and multiple threads that process the same session can access the same ActionForm instance

* ActionForm (not including claesses that implement DynaBean interface, such as DynaActionForm and its subclasses)
* ValidatingActionForm
* ValidatorForm
* ValidatorActionForm

**Condition 2:**
Can process multi-part requests

(This condition applies whether or not the web application uses multi-part forms)

## Impact

Effects vary depending on the web application. For example, a denial-of-service (DoS) may occur.

Also, unintended operations on the ClassLoader by a remote attacker may lead to information being stolen or arbitrary code execution on the server where Apache Struts is running.

## Solution

As of April 5, 2013, Apache Struts 1 is [End-Of-Life (EOL)](https://struts.apache.org/struts1eol-announcement.html).

For information on countermeasures and patches, refer to the information provided by developers that use Apache Struts 1.

|  |  | ## Requirements |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Introduction (Original) |

|  |  | This struts1's fork is for maintenance to fix the vulnerabilities. |

|  |  | ## Requirements |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Introduction (Original) |
|  |  | ------------------------ |
|  |  | Original Struts requires Java 1.4 or higher. But struts1-forever requires Java 1.5 or higher. |
|  |  | Because Commons-Beanutils 1.9.2 is used for preventing a dangerous population. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Fixed vulnerabilities |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - CVE-2014-0114 |
|  |  | - CVE-2016-1181 |

# Vulnerabilities:CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Overview

Last Updated:Apr 5, 2022

IT Security Center

Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan

A list of software weakness types to provide a common language for identifying the type of vulnerability

>> [JAPANESE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/vuln/scap/cwe.html)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)[(\*1)](#L1) aims to provide a common base to identify the type of software weakness (vulnerability).

 Leading the effort with support from the U.S. government, MITRE[(\*2)](#L2) had been working on a specification since 1999 and published the first draft in March 2006. [More than 40 vendors and research entities](http://cwe.mitre.org/community/index.html) have joined hands to improve and expand the specification since then and the version 1.0 of CWE was published on September 9, 2008.

 CWE gives a hierarchically structured list of weakness types to help identifying software vulnerabilities that come in a wide variety, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. The use of CWE will enable software developers and security experts to:

1. Have a common language to discuss software vulnerability in architecture, design and code.
2. Use as a standard measuring rule for security tools, such as a vulnerability scanning tool, to enhance software security.
3. Use as a common foundation to understand, mitigate and prevent vulnerability.

CWE has been adopted by NIST[(\*3)](#L3) for NVD[(\*4)](#L4), OWASP[(\*5)](#L5) for Top Ten Project[(\*6)](#L6) and other security vendors.

 This overview is based on CWE Version 1.5, released by MITRE. For more information, please refer to [MITRE CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).

## 1.CWE Structure

CWE organizes a wide variety of weakness types in a hierarchical structure and gives a unique identifier (CWE-ID) to each type. The weakness types at higher levels in the structure gives a more abstract and broader concept, while those at deeper level gives a more concrete concept or represent an actual CWE entity.

There are four structural classifications in CWE: View, Category, Weakness and Compound Element. Currently, 22 weakness types are classified as View, 105 as Category, 638 as Weakness and 12 as Compound Element. In total, 777 CWE entries are defined and organized in the list.

### (1)View

Each View entry represents a perspective with which one may use CWE and organizes weakness types from the perspective. For example, NIST has handpicked 19 weakness types from CWE based on the vulnerabilities published on NVD and lists them on its Web site ([CWE Cross Section Mapped into by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories#cwes)). The View that consists of those 19 weakness types is being given the CWE-ID of CWE-635, Weaknesses Used by NVD.

 Likewise, CWE-699 is the View organized from the perspective of developers, CWE-1000 from that of researchers, CWE-658 from that of C and CWE-660 from that of Java.

### (2)Category

Each Category entry, given a âgroupingâ capability, represents a collection of weakness types that share a common characteristic.

For instance, CWE-310 is a group of weakness types with cryptographic issues and CWE-355 with user interface issues.

### (3)Weakness

Each Weakness entry represents an actual CWE entity and is subsequently classified using three attributes: Class, Base and Variant.

The Class attribute suggests the most abstract type of weakness of the three. CWE-362, Race Condition, is an example of this type.

The Base attribute suggests a more specific type of weakness that is independent of specific technology or resource. CWE-567, Unsynchronized Access To Shared Data, is an example of this type.

The Variant attribute suggests a specific type of weakness that is dependent of particular resource, technology or context. CWE-488, Data Leak Between Sessions, is an example of this type.

### (4)Compound Element

Each Compound Element entry represents an aggregation of related weakness types with a composite nature and is subsequently classified using two attributes: Composite and Chain.

The Composite attribute suggests a case where a weakness emerges in combination of another weakness. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an example of this type.

The Chain attribute suggests a case where a weakness results in another weakness. CWE-680, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, is an example of this type.

## 2.Elements of CWE

The [CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) is organized by CWE-ID and each CWE entry is provided with various information. To name a few, the CWE elements include Description, Likelihood of Exploit, Common Consequences, Potential Mitigations, Demonstrative Examples and Observed Example.

 Users could use the CWE List as reference to identity, mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 3.JVN iPedia declared CWE-Compatible

[JVN iPedia](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/) began to support CWE as a trial on September 10, 2008[(\*7)](#Footnote). IPA had worked on a few remaining requirements to make a CWE compatibility declaration and declared it CWE-Compatible on October 3, 2008.

 The official list of organizations participating in the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program is available on Mitreâs CWE web site.

 <http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html>

 [MyJVN](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/apis/myjvn/) began to support CWE on October 23, 2008[(\*8)](#Footnote).

 The four mandatory requirements â âCWE Searchabilityâ, âCWE Outputâ, âCWE Documentationâ and âMapping Accuracyâ â for phase 1 are fulfilled by the functions illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1. Requirement Correspondence Status of JVN iPedia and MyJVN
| CWE Searchability | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By using the search function in JVN iPedia, the vulnerability countermeasure information database, users are able to conduct a search using CWE identifiers as the keyword. |
| CWE Output | Capability  JVN iPedia   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifiers are displayed in the âReferencesâ section within each vulnerability countermeasure information pages. |
| CWE Output | Capability  MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifier is displayed in the âAdvisory, related informationâ section of the detailed information window of each vulnerability countermeasure information. |
| CWE Documentation | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  This material document will become the documentation necessary to describe and demonstrate CWE, CWE association and methods used to satisfy the compatibility requirements. |
| Mapping Accuracy | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By setting a JVN iPedia ID in the sec:identifier field of JVNDBRSS, which is used to specify the identifier of the security information, and storing the JVN ID and CWE identifier in the sec:reference field, which are used to specify the URL of the related security information, it is possible to demonstrate the correspondence of the JVN iPedia ID with the CWE identifier. |

Figure 1 shows a hierarchical structure of weakness types to be used by JVN iPedia. It is based on [Development View with Abstractions Highlighted](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdf/699_abstraction_colors.pdf), which is a graph that depicts the hierarchical structure of a View organized from the perspective of developers.

 The yellow-colored ones are to be used by JVN iPedia. For the overall hierarchical structure of the CWE List, please refer to [PDFs with Graphical Depictions of CWE (1.5)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdfs.html).

 IPA will revise the weakness types, analyzing the vulnerabilities published on JVN iPedia, and consider expanding them to include the deeper level of weakness types to support frequently-reported vulnerabilities.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:

# CVE-2016-1181

| **Name** | CVE-2016-1181 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | ActionServlet.java in Apache Struts 1 1.x through 1.3.10 mishandles multithreaded access to an ActionForm instance, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (unexpected memory access) via a multipart request, a related issue to CVE-2015-0899. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-1181) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1181); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2016-1181), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2016-1181), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2016-1181), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2016-1181), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-1181), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1181), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-1181), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-1181)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-1181/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2016-1181)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2016-1181%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2016-1181%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2016-1181%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [libstruts1.2-java](/tracker/source-package/libstruts1.2-java) | source | (unstable) | (unfixed) |  |  |  |

## Notes

```
[wheezy] - libstruts1.2-java <no-dsa> (basically fixed in CVE-2015-0899)
<https://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN03188560/>
Two conditions must be met to exploit this vulnerability
condition one is already fixed in CVE-2015-0899, so everything is fine
condition two can be fixed by the following patch:
<https://github.com/kawasima/struts1-forever/commit/eda3a79907ed8fcb0387a0496d0cb14332f250e8>
but as this completely deactivates multipart requests, this should not be generally applied

# JVN#03188560 Apache Struts 1 vulnerability that allows unintended remote operations against components on memory

## Overview

The Apache Sturts 1 ActionForm contains a vulnerability which allows unintended remote operations against components on server memory, such as Servlets and ClassLoader.

## Products Affected

* Apache Struts versions 1.0 through 1.3.10

## Description

The Apache Sturts 1 ActionForm contains a vulnerability which allows unintended remote operations against components on server memory, such as Servlets and ClassLoader, when the following 2 conditions are met:

**Condition 1:**
When the following ActionForm (including its subclasses) are in the session scope, and multiple threads that process the same session can access the same ActionForm instance

* ActionForm (not including claesses that implement DynaBean interface, such as DynaActionForm and its subclasses)
* ValidatingActionForm
* ValidatorForm
* ValidatorActionForm

**Condition 2:**
Can process multi-part requests

(This condition applies whether or not the web application uses multi-part forms)

## Impact

Effects vary depending on the web application. For example, a denial-of-service (DoS) may occur.

Also, unintended operations on the ClassLoader by a remote attacker may lead to information being stolen or arbitrary code execution on the server where Apache Struts is running.

## Solution

As of April 5, 2013, Apache Struts 1 is [End-Of-Life (EOL)](https://struts.apache.org/struts1eol-announcement.html).

For information on countermeasures and patches, refer to the information provided by developers that use Apache Struts 1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=983728#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2016-06-08 11:31:39 UTC  ``` <https://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN03188560/>   JVN#03188560 Apache Struts 1 vulnerability that allows unintended remote operations against components on memory Overview  The Apache Sturts 1 ActionForm contains a vulnerability which allows unintended remote operations against components on server memory, such as Servlets and ClassLoader. Products Affected      Apache Struts versions 1.0 through 1.3.10  Description  The Apache Sturts 1 ActionForm contains a vulnerability which allows unintended remote operations against components on server memory, such as Servlets and ClassLoader, when the following 2 conditions are met:  Condition 1: When the following ActionForm (including its subclasses) are in the session scope, and multiple threads that process the same session can access the same ActionForm instance      ActionForm (not including claesses that implement DynaBean interface, such as DynaActionForm and its subclasses)     ValidatingActionForm     ValidatorForm     ValidatorActionForm  Condition 2: Can process multi-part requests (This condition applies whether or not the web application uses multi-part forms)  Impact  Effects vary depending on the web application. For example, a denial-of-service (DoS) may occur. Also, unintended operations on the ClassLoader by a remote attacker may lead to information being stolen or arbitrary code execution on the server where Apache Struts is running.
