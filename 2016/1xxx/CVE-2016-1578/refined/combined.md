## Details

A use-after-free was discovered when responding synchronously to

permission requests. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1578](/security/CVE-2016-1578))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2016-1646](/security/CVE-2016-1646))

A use-after-free was discovered in the navigation implementation in

Chromium in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1647](/security/CVE-2016-1647))

A buffer overflow was discovered in ANGLE. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2016-1649](/security/CVE-2016-1649))

An out-of-bounds write was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.

([CVE-2016-1653](/security/CVE-2016-1653))

An invalid read was discovered in the media subsystem in Chromium. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2016-1654](/security/CVE-2016-1654))

It was discovered that frame removal during callback execution could

trigger a use-after-free in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.

([CVE-2016-1655](/security/CVE-2016-1655))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1659](/security/CVE-2016-1659))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-3679](/security/CVE-2016-3679))
