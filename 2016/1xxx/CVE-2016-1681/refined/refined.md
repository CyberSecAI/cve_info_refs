Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-1681:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the `opj_j2k_read_SPCod_SPCoc` function within the `j2k.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. This library is used by the PDFium component in Google Chrome.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of data during the processing of a crafted PDF document. Specifically, the function does not correctly manage memory allocation, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can cause a crash or other unstable behavior.
    *   **Unspecified Other Impact:** The CVE description also notes the possibility of "unspecified other impact," suggesting the potential for more serious consequences such as arbitrary code execution.

**2. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (CVSSv3), Medium (CVSSv2) - While the v2 score indicates "High" complexity, this is likely due to the exploit needing a crafted PDF, while the v3 score more accurately reflects that the exploit itself is not overly complicated.
*   **User Interaction:** Required - A user must open the crafted PDF document in a vulnerable Chrome browser.
*   **Attack Type:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted PDF file.
*  **Scope:** Unchanged (CVSS v3).

**3. Attacker Capabilities:**

*   **Required Position:** Remote attacker, no privileges needed on a target system, but they need to get a user to open a malicious PDF file.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need to create a PDF document that contains malicious data that triggers the buffer overflow in the `opj_j2k_read_SPCod_SPCoc` function.

**4. Affected Software:**

*   Google Chrome versions prior to 51.0.2704.63
*   OpenJPEG library before a certain version (though the specific vulnerable version isn't stated in these sources)
*  SUSE package hub for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12
*  openSUSE Leap 42.1
*  openSUSE 13.2
*  openSUSE Leap 15.0, 15.2, 15.3, and 15.4.
*  openSUSE Tumbleweed
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.
*   Debian (jessie), (stretch), and (sid)
*  Gentoo (versions prior to 51.0.2704.103)

**5. Additional Details:**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in Google Chrome version 51.0.2704.63 and later, and corresponding updates are issued by other vendors that included the fix.
*   **CVSS Scores:** The vulnerability received a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 and a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8 from the NVD. This indicates a high severity vulnerability based on the potential for high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact in the v3 score and partial impact in the v2 score.
*   **Patch Information:** Patches were created and committed upstream to fix this issue.

**In summary:** CVE-2016-1681 is a heap-based buffer overflow in OpenJPEG's code, which can be exploited by a remote attacker via a crafted PDF file. Exploitation can result in a denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution in vulnerable versions of Google Chrome, or any software utilizing the vulnerable library.
