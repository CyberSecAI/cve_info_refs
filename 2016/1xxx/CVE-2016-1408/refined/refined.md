Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1408

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM). This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation in the web interface allows for arbitrary file upload.
- The attacker can execute commands as the `prime web` user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated, remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to the affected system.
- The attacker can execute commands as the `prime web` user, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.
- Although the `prime web` user does not have full root privileges, it still represents a significant security compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the system.
- The vulnerability is located in the web interface, suggesting a web-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. This implies that they need to have valid user credentials for the web interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface.
