{
  "CVE-2016-1898": {
    "Description": "FFmpeg 2.x allows remote attackers to conduct cross-origin attacks and read arbitrary files by using the subfile protocol in an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file, leading to an external HTTP request in which the URL string contains an arbitrary line of a local file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how FFmpeg processes the subfile protocol within HLS M3U8 files.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Cross-origin vulnerability",
      "Local file disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary local files by crafting a malicious HLS M3U8 file, causing an external HTTP request that embeds the content of local files into the URL.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted HLS M3U8 file"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user into processing a crafted HLS M3U8 file. The attacker doesn't need specific privileges on the system, but needs to be able to deliver the crafted file."
