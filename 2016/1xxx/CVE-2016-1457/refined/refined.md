Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the web-based GUI of Cisco Firepower Management Center and Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** The core vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This is a critical flaw that can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Improper Authorization:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks within the web interface which allows authenticated users to escalate privileges and execute commands they should not be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Remote Command Execution:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute commands remotely on the affected system. This allows for potentially any kind of operation on the target machine, enabling the attacker to perform a number of malicious actions.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Due to the ability to execute arbitrary code, attackers could gain complete control over the affected devices.
*   **Data breaches, modification, denial of service:** Attackers could exfiltrate sensitive data, alter configurations, or cause service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, meaning that the attacker does not need local access to the target device.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web-based GUI of the affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, meaning they have legitimate credentials to log into the web interface. This can be considered a weakness due to the fact that an attacker is already in a position to have access to the web GUI.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   Cisco Firepower Management Center and Cisco ASA 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services versions 5.4.0, 5.3.1, 5.3.0.4, 5.2.0, and 4.10.3.9.
*   This vulnerability does not affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to the fixed software releases:
    *   5.3.1.2 and later
    *   5.4.0.1 and later
    *   5.4.1 and later
    *   6.0.0 and later
