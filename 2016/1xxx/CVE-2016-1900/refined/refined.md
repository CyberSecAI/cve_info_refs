Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-1900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames within the `cgit_print_http_headers` function in `ui-shared.c`. Specifically, newline characters within a filename were not being properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CRLF Injection:** The lack of proper escaping allowed an attacker to inject Carriage Return and Line Feed (CRLF) sequences into HTTP headers.
- **HTTP Header Injection:** By injecting CRLF sequences, an attacker could add arbitrary HTTP headers to the response.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected headers could be manipulated to include malicious JavaScript which would then be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the HTTP response, leading to various attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The injection of malicious JavaScript via the filename could lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser within the context of the cgit domain. This could result in data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Filename Manipulation:** The attack vector involves a user with write access to a git repository crafting a filename that contains newline characters.
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered when a request is made to cgit, causing it to render a page which includes the malicious filename in the HTTP header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Write Access to Git Repository:** The attacker must have the ability to write to a git repository that is being served by cgit. This allows the attacker to create or modify files with malicious filenames.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by properly escaping filenames in headers via the commit [513b3863d999f91b47d7e9f26710390db55f9463](http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/commit/?id=513b3863d999f91b47d7e9f26710390db55f9463).
- The vulnerability is present in CGit versions before 0.12.
- The vulnerability is classified as having moderate severity.
