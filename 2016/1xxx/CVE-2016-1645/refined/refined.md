  "CVE-2016-1645": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer signedness errors in the opj_j2k_update_image_data function in j2k.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.87, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect cast and out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer signedness errors in the `opj_j2k_update_image_data` function in `j2k.c` within OpenJPEG library.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer signedness error",
       "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted JPEG 2000 data embedded within a PDF file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker, user interaction is required in that the victim must open the malicious PDF or visit a malicious page.",
     "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is located in the `opj_j2k_update_image_data` function of the OpenJPEG library, which is used by PDFium. The vulnerability is triggered by an incorrect cast, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This vulnerability can potentially allow arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process. It was addressed in Chrome version 49.0.2623.87"
