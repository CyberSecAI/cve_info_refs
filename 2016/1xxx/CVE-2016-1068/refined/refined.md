Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Acrobat Pro DC handles Text fields with a "Validate" field action. Specifically, a specially crafted Text field can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after the memory it pointed to has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to corruption or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running Adobe Acrobat Pro DC). This could enable the attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF Files:** An attacker can embed the specially crafted Text field with the malicious "Validate" action within a PDF file.
- **Malicious Web Pages:** The vulnerability can be triggered by visiting a malicious webpage that exploits this flaw.
- **User Interaction Required:** The target user has to open the malicious PDF file or visit the malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create crafted PDF documents:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PDF file or webpage.
- **Social engineering/Distribution:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious PDF or webpage to the victim to be opened/visited.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Pro DC on both Windows and Macintosh.
- The vulnerability is fixed by updates provided by Adobe.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers with filter ID '24059' are protected.
