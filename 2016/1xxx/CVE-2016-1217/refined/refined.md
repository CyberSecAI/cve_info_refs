Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting vulnerability within the "Check available times" function of Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before including it in the output of the "Check available times" function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the logged-in user's browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of the application interface
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- Requires a user to interact with a crafted malicious payload, likely through a URL link or injected code into the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the "Check available times" function. This could be achieved by:
   - Manipulating URL parameters
   - Finding a way to store data in the application that is later rendered without proper sanitization.

**Affected Versions:**
- Cybozu Garoon versions 3.0.0 to 4.2.1 are vulnerable.
