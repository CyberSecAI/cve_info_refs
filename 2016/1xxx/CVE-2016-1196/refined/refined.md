- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cybozu Garoon fails to restrict access permissions in the API to retrieve Address Book information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, specifically in the API for retrieving Address Book data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user can obtain other users' Address Book information, leading to a potential confidentiality breach.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, with a low attack complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a valid user of the application (low privileges required). No user interaction is required.
