# Chromium: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201605-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the Chromium web

faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Chromium web
browser. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the

## Issue [1704163003](/1704163003/): FileURLToFilePath: Don't unescape '/' and '\\'. (Closed)

| **Created:** 4 years, 10 months ago by [mmenke](/user/mmenke)  **Modified:** 4 years, 10 months ago  **Reviewers:** [eroman](/user/eroman), [brettw](/user/brettw)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, cbentzel+watch\_chromium.org  **Base URL:** https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git@master  **Target Ref:** refs/pending/heads/master  **Project:** [chromium](/search?project=chromium)  **Visibility:** Public.  [**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | DescriptionFileURLToFilePath: Don't unescape '/' and '\\'. GURL leaves these escaped, and unescaping them in paths changes the meaning of the path. Added two values to the UnescapeRule enumeration: PATH\_SEPARATORS and URL\_SPECIAL\_CHARS\_EXCEPT\_PATH\_SEPARATORS. In followup CLs, I intend to replace all uses of URL\_SPECIAL\_CHARS, in favor of one or both the two new values, and eventually remove the value, as it's easily to use in an unsafe manner.

Actually, I'm thinking that the compatibility and web-security ramifications are more around *not* using this for URLs (Of any type), and that's where the scary comment should go instead.  Unescaping slashes on GURLs or GURL components for any reason seems like something that's generally not a good idea, with the exception of Javascript URLs.  We mostly unescape for either display, or picking local file names (On file or http URLs).  For display, it changes the semantic meaning of a URL, so seems like a bad idea.  For local files, it seems like a potential attack vector, regardless of whether we're talking file or http URLs.  I think we should get rid of URL_SPECIAL_CHARS in favor of this, and a separate flag just for path characters - I've added a TODO about that, and a warning to URL_SPECIAL_CHARS.

But dots do have a magical meaning, which is no less magical than slashes and backslashes IMO.  GURL will collapse paths during canonicalization, so for instance    foo/bar/../x ---> foo/x  Right?  This will also occur when the dots are percent escaped, as in %2e%2e.  So from a policy perspective I still don't really understand why we would choose to unescape dots, but not slashes and backslashes.  Both have implications for how file paths are opened on disk.  I get that this CL is trying to at least match the consistency from the point of view of GURL, and LGTM from that side. But as a larger policy I don't quite understand why special preference for slashes but not dots. ```     | **mmenke** | | On 2016/02/18 21:17:22, eroman wrote: > https://codereview.chromium.org/1704163003/diff/40001/net/base/filename\_util\_unittest.cc > File net/base/filename\_util\_unittest.cc (right): > > https://codereview.chromium.org/1704163003/diff/40001/net/base/filename\_util\_unittest.cc#newcode244 > ... | | --- | | 4 years, 10 months ago (2016-02-18 22:11:06 UTC) [#10](#msg10) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/02/18 21:17:22, eroman wrote: > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1704163003/diff/40001/net/base/filename_util_...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1704163003/diff/40001/net/base/filename_util_unittest.cc) > File net/base/filename_util_unittest.cc (right): >  > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1704163003/diff/40001/net/base/filename_util_...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1704163003/diff/40001/net/base/filename_util_unittest.cc#newcode244) > net/base/filename_util_unittest.cc:244: {L"C:\\foo%2f..%5cbar", > "file:///C:\\foo%2f..%5cbar"}, > On 2016/02/18 20:30:22, mmenke wrote: > > On 2016/02/18 19:37:28, eroman wrote: > > > What are the unescaping rules for %2e   (dot) ? > >  > > Dots are unescaped in paths, since they have no magic meaning http or file > URLs > > (They may have a magic meaning to the OS for how to handle opening, but that's > > another matter). > >  > > The periods removed in the other test I added are removed because of magic > code > > to sanitize a file name for download. >  > But dots do have a magical meaning, which is no less magical than slashes and > backslashes IMO. >  > GURL will collapse paths during canonicalization, so for instance >    foo/bar/../x ---> foo/x >  > Right?

"." is not a reserved character in URLs, "/" is (<https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>, see section 2.2), so "/" has to be kept escaped, unlike ".", or it will change the meaning of a URL.  [http://blah/foo%2e](http://blah/foo.) is a file or directory named "foo.", which is the same as "http://blah/foo.", while [http://blah/foo%2f"](http://blah/foo/%22) is a file named "foo/", but that is *not* the same as [http://blah/foo%2f](http://blah/foo/).  Also, <https://blah/foo/../> and [https://blah/foo/%2e%2e/](https://blah/foo/../) both mean the same thing as <https://blah/>.  > Both have implications for how file paths are opened on disk. >  > I get that this CL is trying to at least match the consistency from the point of > view of GURL, and LGTM from that side.

May be worth considering making GURL unescape these characters in file URLs, though that could lead to other issues.  Unescaping characters that GURL doesn't escape in the first place also seems to break canonicalization (If two URLs are canonicalized to different file URLs by GURL, but mapped to the same file path via FileURLToFilePath, seems like that rather contradicts the definition of canonicalization).  Suspect we have a lot of other issues there, though.  BUG=586657 ==========  to  ========== FileURLToFilePath:  Don't unescape '/' and '\\'.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/05/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, May 11, 2016

The stable channel has been updated to 50.0.2661.102 for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [5 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-3-M50+type%3Dbug-security&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$3000][[606115](https://crbug.com/606115)] High CVE-2016-1669: Buffer overflow in V8. Credit to Choongwoo Han.
[$1337][[578882](https://crbug.com/578882)] Medium CVE-2016-1670: Race condition in loader. Credit to anonymous.
[$500][[586657](https://crbug.com/586657)] Medium CVE-2016-1671: Directory traversal using the file scheme on Android. Credit to Jann Horn.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/50.0.2661.94..50.0.2661.102?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in [switching](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) release channels? Find out [how](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
