Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1954:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks in the `nsCSPContext::SendReports` function within Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, it fails to properly validate the `report-uri` directive of a Content Security Policy (CSP). This allows the use of non-HTTP(S) URLs for CSP violation reports.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of the report-uri in CSP headers.
- Ability to load non-HTTP(S) URLs that bypass security checks.
- Potential for local file overwriting through CSP report mechanism.
- Possible privilege escalation when combined with add-ons.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite local files by providing a file://, resource://, or chrome:// URL in the CSP `report-uri` and triggering a violation.
- **Privilege escalation:** By overwriting files within the browser's extension directories, the attacker can inject malicious code that could execute with elevated privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly described as the primary impact, an attacker could cause application crash by overwriting critical files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, by enticing a user to visit a malicious webpage.
- Exploiting the CSP mechanism with a crafted web page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a malicious webpage that includes a crafted Content Security Policy with a non-HTTP(S) URL in the report-uri.
- The user needs to visit the crafted web page.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even without the user interaction if add-on with em:unpack=true registers content package with contentaccessible=yes and attacker knows that the add-on is activated on victim's browser due to fingerprinting
- Unpacked add-ons installed or addon signing disabled.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability exists in Firefox versions prior to 45.0 and ESR 38.x versions before 38.7.
- The exploit uses a combination of CSP violation and javascript payloads. The attacker doesn't have full control over the content being written but can control values inside the report JSON structure.
- The vulnerability can be used to overwrite files that add-ons use if signature checks are disabled by a setting.
- The fix introduced in bug 1188028, which was landed in Firefox 45, mitigates the vulnerability, but this bug tracks the fix for older ESR versions.
- A fix was implemented to only allow http:// or https:// URLs in the report-uri directive at the parser level. A console warning message is added when a non-HTTP(S) url is used.
- Patches have been applied to multiple SUSE and openSUSE products.
- The vulnerability is publicly known and was reported by a researcher writing a thesis.
- The amount of javascript code that can be written in the file using this vulnerability is limited by truncation of script sample to 40 characters.
