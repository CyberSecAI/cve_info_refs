Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the disclosure of sensitive information (wireless passwords and administrative usernames/passwords) via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) on affected Netgear devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is that wireless passwords and administrative credentials are made accessible through SNMP queries.
*   **Lack of Access Control/Proper Restriction:** The SNMP service does not properly restrict access to these sensitive values via specific OIDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can obtain wireless passwords, potentially compromising the wireless network's security and gaining unauthorized access.
*   **System Compromise:** With administrative usernames and passwords, an attacker could gain full control over the device, leading to various malicious activities including denial of service, network manipulation, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SNMP Queries:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specific SNMP queries using the vulnerable OIDs:
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.4.1.1.1
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.37.4.1.1.1
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.4.1.1.1
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.8.1.5
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.5
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.7
    *   iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.10.1.7

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable devices to send the SNMP queries, either on the same LAN or possibly remotely if SNMP service is exposed to the internet.
*   **SNMP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how SNMP works, and how to query for specific OIDs.

**Affected Devices:**

*   Netgear WNAP320
*   Netgear WNDAP350
*   Netgear WNDAP360

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Netgear advisory states that upgrading to firmware version 3.5.5.0 or later will mitigate the vulnerability.
*   This information is more detailed than a basic CVE description by providing the vulnerable OIDs and exact impact.
