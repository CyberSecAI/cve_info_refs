Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox handles history navigations in combination with the `location.protocol` property. Specifically, a website can manipulate the address bar's displayed URL by setting the `location.protocol` to "data" and then using `history.back()` to navigate back to a previous page, causing the address bar to display the wrong URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- URL Spoofing: The primary vulnerability is URL spoofing, where the address bar displays a misleading or incorrect URL, differing from the actual document. This allows an attacker to trick a user.
- Mishandling of `location.protocol`: The ability to set `location.protocol` to "data" appears to be a prerequisite for this exploit.
- History manipulation: The vulnerability uses `history.back()` to navigate to a previous page and trigger the spoof.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- URL Spoofing: The most immediate impact is that an attacker can display a false URL in the browser's address bar. This can mislead users into believing they are on a trusted website, when they are actually on a malicious site. This may trick them into providing sensitive data or performing actions they wouldn't normally do.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted website: An attacker needs to create a website that exploits the vulnerability using JavaScript.
- User interaction: The user needs to navigate to a crafted website, potentially via a malicious link or social engineering. They then need to interact with that page (e.g., by clicking a button). Finally they have to navigate back to the previous page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must be able to create a malicious website.
- Attacker needs a user to visit and interact with the malicious website, and then use history.back() to trigger the spoofing.

The content also provides additional context:
- Several sources indicate that this is a "moderate" or "important" severity vulnerability.
- It appears the vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 45.0 and Firefox ESR 38.7.
- The vulnerability is listed in multiple security advisories, indicating its broad impact across several distributions such as Ubuntu and openSUSE.
- Several patches were developed and applied across different branches of Firefox to address the issue.
