Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1344:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of crafted, fragmented IKEv2 packets within the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 2 (v2) fragmentation code of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of fragmented IKEv2 packets.
- Insufficient validation or processing of fragmented packets, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause a reload (crash) of the affected system.
- This results in a denial-of-service, interrupting the device's normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted UDP packets to the affected system.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- The attack needs to be directed at the affected device (traffic destined to the device itself)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the targeted Cisco device.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when IKEv2 fragmentation is enabled on the Cisco device.
- Devices are vulnerable if configured for any type of VPN based on IKEv2 such as LAN-to-LAN VPN, Remote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN), Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN), FlexVPN, or Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GETVPN)
- IKEv1-based VPNs are not directly affected; however, in some cases, enabling IKEv1 will automatically enable IKEv2.
- IKEv2 fragmentation is not enabled by default.
- The advisory provides commands to check if IKEv2 fragmentation is enabled (`show running-config | include crypto ikev2 fragmentation`) and to verify if IKE is running (`show ip sockets` or `show udp` command and check for UDP port 500, 4500 or 848 being open).
- A workaround is available which is to disable IKEv2 fragmentation using the `no crypto ikev2 fragmentation` command. However, if IKEv2 fragmentation is needed there is no other workaround.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
