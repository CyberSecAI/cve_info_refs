Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in the HOME SPOT CUBE wireless LAN router's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in the web interface of the HOME SPOT CUBE router. This allows an attacker to potentially force a logged-in user's browser to make unauthorized requests to the router.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the CSRF vulnerability can lead to an arbitrary administrative operation such as setting alteration being executed on the router without the user's knowledge or consent.  This could include changes to the router's configuration, potentially disrupting service or creating further vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to entice a user who is already logged into the router's web interface to visit a malicious website or open a malicious email. The malicious website or email will then trigger a request to the router's web interface on behalf of the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not need any special privileges on the router itself. The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or send a malicious email, and needs a user to be logged in to the router's interface and to interact with the attacker's malicious content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The JVN information explicitly states that HOME SPOT CUBE2 is not affected by the vulnerability.
*   The vendor (KDDI) has provided a workaround rather than a patch, recommending users change their login password, avoid other websites while logged into the router's configuration page, and clear browser data. They also recommend considering using a different router model (HOME SPOT CUBE2).
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 4.3 (Medium) and CVSS v2 base score is 2.6 (Low).
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery.
