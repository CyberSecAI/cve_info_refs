Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Cisco IOS and IOS XE software process Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets. Specifically, there are insufficient checks when clearing invalid NTP packets from the interface queue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient checks in the processing of NTP packets.
- Lack of proper handling of invalid or crafted NTP packets.
- Inadequate queue management for NTP packets leading to a wedge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause an interface wedge on the targeted device.
- The interface, once wedged, stops receiving traffic.
- The device will experience a DoS condition until it is reloaded.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing authentication.
- **Crafted NTP Packets:** The attack involves sending specially crafted NTP packets to the vulnerable device.
- **UDP Port 123:** The crafted packets are sent to the UDP listening port 123, which is the standard NTP port.
- **IPv4 and IPv6:** The vulnerability can be exploited using both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.
- **Unicast Addressing:** The destination of the crafted packets can be any unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address of any interface configured on the device or a network address.
- **Traffic Destination:** The attack can only be triggered by traffic destined to the affected device; it cannot be exploited with traffic transiting the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to create and send crafted NTP packets.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or access to the device before the exploit can be initiated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists if the device is configured for NTP operations.
- NTP is not enabled by default on Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software.
- Control Plane Policing (CoPP) with an interface access control list (ACL) can be used as a mitigation measure, but is not a fix.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a support case.
- No public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability were known at the time of the advisory.

**Affected Products:**
The following releases of Cisco IOS Software and the corresponding releases of IOS XE Software are affected:
   - 15.5(3)S3 - 3.16.3S
   - 15.6(1)S2 - 3.17.2S
   - 15.6(2)S1 - 3.18.1S
   - 15.6(2)T1
