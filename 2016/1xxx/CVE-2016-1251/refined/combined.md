```
…rver_prepare=1

Function dbd_st_fetch() via Renew() can reallocate output buffer for
mysql_stmt_fetch() call. But it does not update pointer to that buffer in
imp_sth->stmt structure initialized by mysql_stmt_bind_result() function.
That leads to use-after-free in any mysql function which access
imp_sth->stmt structure (e.g. mysql_stmt_fetch()).

This patch fix this problem and properly updates pointer in imp_sth->stmt
structure after Renew() call.

Test 40server_prepare_crash.t is extended to check for that use-after-free
crash.
```

Subject: CVE-2016-1251 - use after free in DBD::mysql when using prepared
 statements - medium

DBD::mysql is the perl DBI driver for MySQL and the primary way Perl
applications and scripts access MySQL and MariaDB databases. The
source repository is at <https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql>.

A vulnerability was discovered that can lead to a use after free when
using prepared statements. This vulnerability is present in all
releases at least back to versions 3.0 of the driver, which were
released in 2005.

The CVE identifier for this vulnerability is CVE-2016-1251.

Version 4.041, including the fix for this vulnerability, is available
on CPAN at [https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3Amysql)

The fix itself is available at
<https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/commit/3619c170461a3107a258d1fd2d00ed4832adb1b1>

Users of DBD::mysql using prepared statements are advised to patch
their installations as soon as possible. Distributors of DBD::mysql
are requested to make this fix available to their end users.

Many thanks to Pali Rohár for discovering and fixing the vulnerability.

# NAME

DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)

# SYNOPSIS

```
use DBI;

my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);

my $sth = $dbh->prepare(
    'SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM authors WHERE last_name = ?')
    or die "prepare statement failed: $dbh->errstr()";
$sth->execute('Eggers') or die "execution failed: $dbh->errstr()";
print $sth->rows . " rows found.\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
    print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, fn = $ref->{'first_name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish;
```
# EXAMPLE

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;

# Connect to the database.
my $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
                       "joe", "joe's password",
                       {'RaiseError' => 1});

# Drop table 'foo'. This may fail, if 'foo' doesn't exist
# Thus we put an eval around it.
eval { $dbh->do("DROP TABLE foo") };
print "Dropping foo failed: $@\n" if $@;

# Create a new table 'foo'. This must not fail, thus we don't
# catch errors.
$dbh->do("CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(20))");

# INSERT some data into 'foo'. We are using $dbh->quote() for
# quoting the name.
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, " . $dbh->quote("Tim") . ")");

# same thing, but using placeholders (recommended!)
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef, 2, "Jochen");

# now retrieve data from the table.
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM foo");
$sth->execute();
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
  print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, name = $ref->{'name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish();

# Disconnect from the database.
$dbh->disconnect();
```
# DESCRIPTION

**DBD::mysql** is the Perl5 Database Interface driver for the MySQL database. In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl programming language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the MySQL relational database management system. Most functions provided by this programming API are supported. Some rarely used functions are missing, mainly because no-one ever requested them. :-)

In what follows we first discuss the use of DBD::mysql, because this is what you will need the most. For installation, see the separate document [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod). See ["EXAMPLE"](#EXAMPLE) for a simple example above.

From perl you activate the interface with the statement

```
use DBI;
```

After that you can connect to multiple MySQL database servers and send multiple queries to any of them via a simple object oriented interface. Two types of objects are available: database handles and statement handles. Perl returns a database handle to the connect method like so:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=$db;host=$host",
  $user, $password, {RaiseError => 1});
```

Once you have connected to a database, you can execute SQL statements with:

```
  my $query = sprintf("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%d, %s)",
		      $number, $dbh->quote("name"));
  $dbh->do($query);
```

See [DBI](/pod/DBI) for details on the quote and do methods. An alternative approach is

```
  $dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef,
	   $number, $name);
```

in which case the quote method is executed automatically. See also the bind\_param method in [DBI](/pod/DBI). See ["DATABASE HANDLES"](#DATABASE-HANDLES) below for more details on database handles.

If you want to retrieve results, you need to create a so-called statement handle with:

```
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table");
$sth->execute();
```

This statement handle can be used for multiple things. First of all you can retrieve a row of data:

```
my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref();
```

If your table has columns ID and NAME, then $row will be hash ref with keys ID and NAME. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES) below for more details on statement handles.

But now for a more formal approach:

## Class Methods

**connect**
```
use DBI;

$dsn = "DBI:mysql:$database";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";

$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

The `database` is not a required attribute, but please note that MySQL has no such thing as a default database. If you don't specify the database at connection time your active database will be null and you'd need to prefix your tables with the database name; i.e. 'SELECT \* FROM mydb.mytable'.

This is similar to the behavior of the mysql command line client. Also, 'SELECT DATABASE()' will return the current database active for the handle.

host

port

The hostname, if not specified or specified as '' or 'localhost', will default to a MySQL server running on the local machine using the default for the UNIX socket. To connect to a MySQL server on the local machine via TCP, you must specify the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1) as the host.

Should the MySQL server be running on a non-standard port number, you may explicitly state the port number to connect to in the `hostname` argument, by concatenating the *hostname* and *port number* together separated by a colon ( `:` ) character or by using the `port` argument.

To connect to a MySQL server on localhost using TCP/IP, you must specify the hostname as 127.0.0.1 (with the optional port).

When connecting to a MySQL Server with IPv6, a bracketed IPv6 address should be used. Example DSN:

```
my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:;host=[1a12:2800:6f2:85::f20:8cf];port=3306";
```

mysql\_client\_found\_rows

If TRUE (Default), sets the CLIENT\_FOUND\_ROWS flag when connecting to MySQL. This causes UPDATE statements to return the number of rows \*matched\*, not the number of rows actually changed.

If you want the number of rows changed in response to an UPDATE statement, specify "mysql\_client\_found\_rows=0" in the DSN.

mysql\_compression

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression", then this will be used to set the compression algorithms for the connection.

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression=1", then the compression algorithms will be set to "zlib". This is for backwards compatibility with older versions of DBD::mysql.

mysql\_connect\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_connect\_timeout=##", the connect request to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_write\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_write\_timeout=##", the write operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_read\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_read\_timeout=##", the read operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_init\_command

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_init\_command=##", then this SQL statement is executed when connecting to the MySQL server. It is automatically re-executed if reconnection occurs.

mysql\_skip\_secure\_auth

This option is for older mysql databases that don't have secure auth set.

mysql\_read\_default\_file

mysql\_read\_default\_group

These options can be used to read a config file like /etc/my.cnf or ~/.my.cnf. By default MySQL's C client library doesn't use any config files unlike the client programs (mysql, mysqladmin, ...) that do, but outside of the C client library. Thus you need to explicitly request reading a config file, as in

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password)
```

The option mysql\_read\_default\_group can be used to specify the default group in the config file: Usually this is the *client* group, but see the following example:

```
[client]
host=localhost

[perl]
host=perlhost
```

(Note the order of the entries! The example won't work, if you reverse the [client] and [perl] sections!)

If you read this config file, then you'll be typically connected to *localhost*. However, by using

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=perl;"
    . "mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

you'll be connected to *perlhost*. Note that if you specify a default group and do not specify a file, then the default config files will all be read. See the documentation of the C function mysql\_options() for details.

mysql\_socket

It is possible to choose the Unix socket that is used for connecting to the server. This is done, for example, with

```
mysql_socket=/dev/mysql
```

Usually there's no need for this option, unless you are using another location for the socket than that built into the client.

mysql\_ssl

A true value turns on the CLIENT\_SSL flag when connecting to the MySQL server and enforce SSL encryption. A false value (which is default) disable SSL encryption with the MySQL server.

When enabling SSL encryption you should set also other SSL options, at least mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file or mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path.

```
mysql_ssl=1 mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert=1 mysql_ssl_ca_file=/path/to/ca_cert.pem
```

This means that your communication with the server will be encrypted.

Please note that this can only work if you enabled SSL when compiling DBD::mysql; this is the default starting version 4.034. See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod) for more details.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file

The path to a file in PEM format that contains a list of trusted SSL certificate authorities.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path

The path to a directory that contains trusted SSL certificate authority certificates in PEM format.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

Please note that this option is supported only if your MySQL client was compiled with OpenSSL library, and not with default yaSSL library.

mysql\_ssl\_verify\_server\_cert

Checks the server's Common Name value in the certificate that the server sends to the client. The client verifies that name against the host name the client uses for connecting to the server, and the connection fails if there is a mismatch. For encrypted connections, this option helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Verification of the host name is disabled by default.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_key

The name of the SSL key file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_cert

The name of the SSL certificate file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_cipher

A list of permissible ciphers to use for connection encryption. If no cipher in the list is supported, encrypted connections will not work.

```
mysql_ssl_cipher=AES128-SHA
mysql_ssl_cipher=DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA
```

mysql\_ssl\_optional

Setting `mysql_ssl_optional` to true disables strict SSL enforcement and makes SSL connection optional. This option opens security hole for man-in-the-middle attacks. Default value is false which means that `mysql_ssl` set to true enforce SSL encryption.

This option was introduced in 4.043 version of DBD::mysql. Due to [The BACKRONYM](http://backronym.fail/) and [The Riddle](http://riddle.link/) vulnerabilities in libmysqlclient library, enforcement of SSL encryption was not possbile and therefore `mysql_ssl_optional=1` was effectively set for all DBD::mysql versions prior to 4.043. Starting with 4.043, DBD::mysql with `mysql_ssl=1` could refuse connection to MySQL server if underlaying libmysqlclient library is vulnerable. Option `mysql_ssl_optional` can be used to make SSL connection vulnerable.

mysql\_server\_pubkey

Path to the RSA public key of the server. This is used for the sha256\_password and caching\_sha2\_password authentication plugins.

mysql\_get\_server\_pubkey

Setting `mysql_get_server_pubkey` to true requests the public RSA key of the server.

mysql\_local\_infile

The LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA may be disabled in the MySQL client library by default. If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_local\_infile=1", LOAD DATA LOCAL will be enabled. (However, this option is \*ineffective\* if the server has also been configured to disallow LOCAL.)

mysql\_multi\_statements

Support for multiple statements separated by a semicolon (;) may be enabled by using this option. Enabling this option may cause problems if server-side prepared statements are also enabled.

mysql\_server\_prepare

This option is used to enable server side prepared statements.

To use server side prepared statements, all you need to do is set the variable mysql\_server\_prepare in the connect:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost;mysql_server_prepare=1",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1 }
);
```

or:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1, mysql_server_prepare => 1 }
);
```

There are many benefits to using server side prepare statements, mostly if you are performing many inserts because of that fact that a single statement is prepared to accept multiple insert values.

To make sure that the 'make test' step tests whether server prepare works, you just need to export the env variable MYSQL\_SERVER\_PREPARE:

```
export MYSQL_SERVER_PREPARE=1
```

Please note that mysql server cannot prepare or execute some prepared statements. In this case DBD::mysql fallbacks to normal non-prepared statement and tries again.

mysql\_server\_prepare\_disable\_fallback

This option disable fallback to normal non-prepared statement when mysql server does not support execution of current statement as prepared.

Useful when you want to be sure that statement is going to be executed as server side prepared. Error message and code in case of failure is propagated back to DBI.

mysql\_conn\_attrs

The option <mysql\_conn\_attrs> is a hash of attribute names and values which can be used to send custom connection attributes to the server. Some attributes like '\_os', '\_platform', '\_client\_name' and '\_client\_version' are added by libmysqlclient and 'program\_name' is added by DBD::mysql.

You can then later read these attributes from the performance schema tables which can be quite helpful for profiling your database or creating statistics.

```
my $dbh= DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password,
  { AutoCommit => 0,
    mysql_conn_attrs => {
      foo => 'bar',
      wiz => 'bang'
    },
  });
```

Now you can select the results from the performance schema tables. You can do this in the same session, but also afterwards. It can be very useful to answer questions like 'which script sent this query?'.

```
my $results = $dbh->selectall_hashref(
  'SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_connect_attrs',
  'ATTR_NAME'
);
```

This returns:

```
$result = {
  'foo' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bar',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'foo',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '6'
  },
  'wiz' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bang',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'wiz',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '3'
  },
  'program_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => './foo.pl',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'program_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '5'
  },
  '_client_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'libmysql',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '1'
  },
  '_client_version' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '5.6.24',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_version',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '7'
  },
  '_os' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'osx10.8',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_os',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '0'
  },
  '_pid' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '59860',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_pid',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '2'
  },
  '_platform' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'x86_64',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_platform',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '4'
  }
};
```

# DATABASE HANDLES

The DBD::mysql driver supports the following attributes of database handles (read only):

```
$errno = $dbh->{'mysql_errno'};
$error = $dbh->{'mysql_error'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_hostinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_info'};
$insertid = $dbh->{'mysql_insertid'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_protoinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_serverinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_stat'};
$threadId = $dbh->{'mysql_thread_id'};
```

These correspond to mysql\_errno(), mysql\_error(), mysql\_get\_host\_info(), mysql\_info(), mysql\_insert\_id(), mysql\_get\_proto\_info(), mysql\_get\_server\_info(), mysql\_stat() and mysql\_thread\_id(), respectively.

mysql\_clientinfo

List information of the MySQL client library that DBD::mysql was built against:

```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientinfo}\n";

8.3.0
```

mysql\_clientversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_serverversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_serverversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_dbd\_stats
```
$info_hashref = $dbh->{mysql_dbd_stats};
```

DBD::mysql keeps track of some statistics in the mysql\_dbd\_stats attribute. The following stats are being maintained:

auto\_reconnects\_ok

The number of times that DBD::mysql successfully reconnected to the mysql server.

auto\_reconnects\_failed

The number of times that DBD::mysql tried to reconnect to mysql but failed.

The DBD::mysql driver also supports the following attributes of database handles (read/write):

mysql\_auto\_reconnect

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql will automatically reconnect to mysql if the connection be lost. This feature defaults to off; however, if either the GATEWAY\_INTERFACE or MOD\_PERL environment variable is set, DBD::mysql will turn mysql\_auto\_reconnect on. Setting mysql\_auto\_reconnect to on is not advised if 'lock tables' is used because if DBD::mysql reconnect to mysql all table locks will be lost. This attribute is ignored when AutoCommit is turned off, and when AutoCommit is turned off, DBD::mysql will not automatically reconnect to the server.

It is also possible to set the default value of the `mysql_auto_reconnect` attribute for the $dbh by passing it in the `\%attr` hash for `DBI-`connect>.

```
$dbh->{mysql_auto_reconnect} = 1;
```

or

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password, {
   mysql_auto_reconnect => 1,
});
```

Note that if you are using a module or framework that performs reconnections for you (for example [DBIx::Connector](/pod/DBIx%3A%3AConnector) in fixup mode), this value must be set to 0.

mysql\_use\_result

This attribute forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. mysql\_store\_result is the default due to that fact storing the result is expected behavior with most applications.

It is possible to set the default value of the `mysql_use_result` attribute for the $dbh via the DSN:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:test;mysql_use_result=1", "root", "");
```

You can also set it after creation of the database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 0; # disable
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 1; # enable
```

You can also set or unset the `mysql_use_result` setting on your statement handle, when creating the statement handle or after it has been created. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES).

mysql\_enable\_utf8

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql should assume strings stored in the database are utf8. This feature defaults to off.

When set, a data retrieved from a textual column type (char, varchar, etc) will have the UTF-8 flag turned on if necessary. This enables character semantics on that string. You will also need to ensure that your database / table / column is configured to use UTF8. See for more information the chapter on character set support in the MySQL manual: <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset.html>

Additionally, turning on this flag tells MySQL that incoming data should be treated as UTF-8. This will only take effect if used as part of the call to connect(). If you turn the flag on after connecting, you will need to issue the command `SET NAMES utf8` to get the same effect.

This flag's implementation suffers the "Unicode Bug" on passed statements and input bind parameters, and cannot be fixed for historical reasons. In order to pass strings with Unicode characters consistently through DBD::mysql, you can use a "hack" workaround of calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function on scalars immediately before passing them to DBD::mysql. Calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function has absolutely no effect on (correctly written) Perl code, but forces DBD::mysql to interpret it correctly as text data to be encoded. In the same way, binary (byte) data can be passed through DBD::mysql without being encoded as text data by calling the `utf8::downgrade()` function (it dies on wide Unicode strings with codepoints above U+FF). See the following example:

```
# check that last name contains LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH STROKE (U+D8)
my $statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name LIKE '%\x{D8}%' AND first_name = ? AND data = ?";

my $wide_string_param = "Andr\x{E9}"; # Andre with LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+E9)

my $byte_param = "\x{D8}\x{A0}\x{39}\x{F8}"; # some bytes (binary data)

my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:database', 'username', 'pass', { mysql_enable_utf8mb4 => 1 });

utf8::upgrade($statement); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement);

utf8::upgrade($wide_string_param); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(1, $wide_string_param);

utf8::downgrade($byte_param); # byte fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(2, $byte_param, DBI::SQL_BINARY); # set correct binary type

$sth->execute();

my $output = $sth->fetchall_arrayref();
# returned data in $output reference should be already UTF-8 decoded as appropriate
```

mysql\_enable\_utf8mb4

This is similar to mysql\_enable\_utf8, but is capable of handling 4-byte UTF-8 characters.

mysql\_bind\_type\_guessing

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) to attempt to guess if a value being bound is a numeric value, and if so, doesn't quote the value. This was created by Dragonchild and is one way to deal with the performance issue of using quotes in a statement that is inserting or updating a large numeric value. This was previously called `unsafe_bind_type_guessing` because it is experimental. I have successfully run the full test suite with this option turned on, the name can now be simply `mysql_bind_type_guessing`.

CAVEAT: Even though you can insert an integer value into a character column, if this column is indexed, if you query that column with the integer value not being quoted, it will not use the index:

```
mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = '3' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ref
possible_keys: value0
          key: value0
      key_len: 13
          ref: const
         rows: 1
        Extra: Using index condition
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = 3
    -> \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ALL
possible_keys: value0
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 6
        Extra: Using where
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

See bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43822

`mysql_bind_type_guessing` can be turned on via

```
- through DSN

 my $dbh= DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
 { mysql_bind_type_guessing => 1})

 - OR after handle creation

 $dbh->{mysql_bind_type_guessing} = 1;
```

mysql\_bind\_comment\_placeholders

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) will cause any placeholders in comments to be bound. This is not correct prepared statement behavior, but some developers have come to depend on this behavior, so I have made it available in 4.015

mysql\_no\_autocommit\_cmd

This attribute causes the driver to not issue 'set autocommit' either through explicit or using mysql\_autocommit(). This is particularly useful in the case of using MySQL Proxy.

See the bug report:

https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46308

`mysql_no_autocommit_cmd` can be turned on when creating the database handle:

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
{ mysql_no_autocommit_cmd => 1});
```

or using an existing database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_no_autocommit_cmd} = 1;
```

ping

This can be used to send a ping to the server.

```
$rc = $dbh->ping();
```

# STATEMENT HANDLES

The statement handles of DBD::mysql support a number of attributes. You access these by using, for example,

```
my $numFields = $sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
```

Note, that most attributes are valid only after a successful *execute*. An `undef` value will returned otherwise. The most important exception is the `mysql_use_result` attribute, which forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. (That's why mysql\_store\_result is the default.)

To set the `mysql_use_result` attribute, use either of the following:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("QUERY", { mysql_use_result => 1});
```

or

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
$sth->{mysql_use_result} = 1;
```

Column dependent attributes, for example *NAME*, the column names, are returned as a reference to an array. The array indices are corresponding to the indices of the arrays returned by *fetchrow* and similar methods. For example the following code will print a header of table names together with all rows:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table") ||
  die "Error:" . $dbh->errstr . "\n";

$sth->execute ||  die "Error:" . $sth->errstr . "\n";

my $names = $sth->{NAME};
my $numFields = $sth->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'} - 1;
for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$names[$i]);
}
print "\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref) {
    for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$ref[$i]);
    }
    print "\n";
}
```

For portable applications you should restrict yourself to attributes with capitalized or mixed case names. Uppercase attribute names are in the statement handle interface described by [DBI](/pod/DBI), while lower case attribute names are private to DBD::mysql. The attribute list includes:

NAME

A reference to an array of column names, as per DBI docs.

NULLABLE

A reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that this column may contain NULL's.

NUM\_OF\_FIELDS

Number of fields returned by a *SELECT* or *LISTFIELDS* statement. You may use this for checking whether a statement returned a result: A zero value indicates a non-SELECT statement like *INSERT*, *DELETE* or *UPDATE*.

TYPE

A reference to an array of column types. The engine's native column types are mapped to portable types like DBI::SQL\_INTEGER() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(), as good as possible. Not all native types have a meaningful equivalent, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_INTERVAL is mapped to DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(). If you need the native column types, use *mysql\_type*. See below.

ChopBlanks

this attribute determines whether a *fetchrow* will chop preceding and trailing blanks off the column values. Chopping blanks does not have impact on the *max\_length* attribute.

ParamValues

This attribute is supported as described in the DBI documentation.

It returns a hashref, the keys of which are the 'names' of the placeholders: integers starting at 1. It returns an empty hashref if the statement has no placeholders.

The values for these keys are initially undef; they are populated with `bind_param`, or when `execute` method is called with parameters. (Supplying the parameter values in the arguments to `execute` will override any previously bound values.)

After execution, it is possible to use `bind_param` to change a single parameter value and `execute` the statement again, with other values unchanged. The attribute remains properly populated after the `finish` method is called, with the values from the last execution.

mysql\_gtids

Returns GTID(s) if GTID session tracking is ensabled in the server via session\_track\_gtids.

mysql\_insertid

If the statement you executed performs an INSERT, and there is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column in the table you inserted in, this attribute holds the value stored into the AUTO\_INCREMENT column, if that value is automatically generated, by storing NULL or 0 or was specified as an explicit value.

Typically, you'd access the value via $sth->{mysql\_insertid}. The value can also be accessed via $dbh->{mysql\_insertid} but this can easily produce incorrect results in case one database handle is shared.

mysql\_is\_blob

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a blob. This attribute is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a key. This is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_num

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column contains numeric values.

mysql\_is\_pri\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a primary key.

mysql\_is\_auto\_increment

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that the respective column is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column. This is only valid for MySQL.

mysql\_length

mysql\_max\_length

A reference to an array of maximum column sizes. The *max\_length* is the maximum physically present in the result table, *length* gives the theoretically possible maximum. *max\_length* is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_table

A reference to an array of table names, useful in a *JOIN* result.

mysql\_type

A reference to an array of MySQL's native column types, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_SHORT() or DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_STRING(). Use the *TYPE* attribute, if you want portable types like DBI::SQL\_SMALLINT() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR().

mysql\_type\_name

Similar to mysql, but type names and not numbers are returned. Whenever possible, the ANSI SQL name is preferred.

mysql\_warning\_count

The number of warnings generated during execution of the SQL statement. This attribute is available on both statement handles and database handles.

# TRANSACTION SUPPORT

The transaction support works as follows:

* By default AutoCommit mode is on, following the DBI specifications.
* If you execute

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  ```

  or

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 1;
  ```

  then the driver will set the MySQL server variable autocommit to 0 or 1, respectively. Switching from 0 to 1 will also issue a COMMIT, following the DBI specifications.
* The methods

  ```
  $dbh->rollback();
  $dbh->commit();
  ```

  will issue the commands ROLLBACK and COMMIT, respectively. A ROLLBACK will also be issued if AutoCommit mode is off and the database handles DESTROY method is called. Again, this is following the DBI specifications.

Given the above, you should note the following:

* You should never change the server variable autocommit manually, unless you are ignoring DBI's transaction support.
* Switching AutoCommit mode from on to off or vice versa may fail. You should always check for errors when changing AutoCommit mode. The suggested way of doing so is using the DBI flag RaiseError. If you don't like RaiseError, you have to use code like the following:

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  if ($dbh->{AutoCommit}) {
    # An error occurred!
  }
  ```
* If you detect an error while changing the AutoCommit mode, you should no longer use the database handle. In other words, you should disconnect and reconnect again, because the transaction mode is unpredictable. Alternatively you may verify the transaction mode by checking the value of the server variable autocommit. However, such behaviour isn't portable.
* DBD::mysql has a "reconnect" feature that handles the so-called MySQL "morning bug": If the server has disconnected, most probably due to a timeout, then by default the driver will reconnect and attempt to execute the same SQL statement again. However, this behaviour is disabled when AutoCommit is off: Otherwise the transaction state would be completely unpredictable after a reconnect.
* The "reconnect" feature of DBD::mysql can be toggled by using the [mysql\_auto\_reconnect](/pod/mysql_auto_reconnect) attribute. This behaviour should be turned off in code that uses LOCK TABLE because if the database server time out and DBD::mysql reconnect, table locks will be lost without any indication of such loss.

# MULTIPLE RESULT SETS

DBD::mysql supports multiple result sets, thanks to Guy Harrison!

The basic usage of multiple result sets is

```
do
{
  while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array())
  {
    do stuff;
  }
} while ($sth->more_results)
```

An example would be:

```
$dbh->do("drop procedure if exists someproc") or print $DBI::errstr;

$dbh->do("create procedure someproc() deterministic
 begin
 declare a,b,c,d int;
 set a=1;
 set b=2;
 set c=3;
 set d=4;
 select a, b, c, d;
 select d, c, b, a;
 select b, a, c, d;
 select c, b, d, a;
end") or print $DBI::errstr;

$sth=$dbh->prepare('call someproc()') ||
die $DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr;

$sth->execute || die DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr; $rowset=0;
do {
  print "\nRowset ".++$i."\n---------------------------------------\n\n";
  foreach $colno (0..$sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS}-1) {
    print $sth->{NAME}->[$colno]."\t";
  }
  print "\n";
  while (@row= $sth->fetchrow_array())  {
    foreach $field (0..$#row) {
      print $row[$field]."\t";
    }
    print "\n";
  }
} until (!$sth->more_results)
```
## Issues with multiple result sets

Please be aware there could be issues if your result sets are "jagged", meaning the number of columns of your results vary. Varying numbers of columns could result in your script crashing.

# MULTITHREADING

The multithreading capabilities of DBD::mysql depend completely on the underlying C libraries. The modules are working with handle data only, no global variables are accessed or (to the best of my knowledge) thread unsafe functions are called. Thus DBD::mysql is believed to be completely thread safe, if the C libraries are thread safe and you don't share handles among threads.

The obvious question is: Are the C libraries thread safe? In the case of MySQL the answer is yes, since MySQL 5.5 it is.

# ASYNCHRONOUS QUERIES

You can make a single asynchronous query per MySQL connection; this allows you to submit a long-running query to the server and have an event loop inform you when it's ready. An asynchronous query is started by either setting the 'async' attribute to a true value in the ["do" in DBI](/pod/DBI#do) method, or in the ["prepare" in DBI](/pod/DBI#prepare) method. Statements created with 'async' set to true in prepare always run their queries asynchronously when ["execute" in DBI](/pod/DBI#execute) is called. The driver also offers three additional methods: `mysql_async_result`, `mysql_async_ready`, and `mysql_fd`. `mysql_async_result` returns what do or execute would have; that is, the number of rows affected. `mysql_async_ready` returns true if `mysql_async_result` will not block, and zero otherwise. They both return `undef` if that handle was not created with 'async' set to true or if an asynchronous query was not started yet. `mysql_fd` returns the file descriptor number for the MySQL connection; you can use this in an event loop.

Here's an example of how to use the asynchronous query interface:

```
use feature 'say';
$dbh->do('SELECT SLEEP(10)', { async => 1 });
until($dbh->mysql_async_ready) {
  say 'not ready yet!';
  sleep 1;
}
my $rows = $dbh->mysql_async_result;
```
# INSTALLATION

See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod).

# AUTHORS

Originally, there was a non-DBI driver, Mysql, which was much like PHP drivers such as mysql and mysqli. The **Mysql** module was originally written by Andreas König <koenig@kulturbox.de> who still, to this day, contributes patches to DBD::mysql. An emulated version of Mysql was provided to DBD::mysql from Jochen Wiedmann, but eventually deprecated as it was another bundle of code to maintain.

The first incarnation of DBD::mysql was developed by Alligator Descartes, who was also aided and abetted by Gary Shea, Andreas König and Tim Bunce.

The current incarnation of **DBD::mysql** was written by Jochen Wiedmann, then numerous changes and bug-fixes were added by Rudy Lippan. Next, prepared statement support was added by Patrick Galbraith and Alexy Stroganov (who also solely added embedded server support).

For the past nine years DBD::mysql has been maintained by Patrick Galbraith (*patg@patg.net*), and recently with the great help of Michiel Beijen (*michiel.beijen@gmail.com*), along with the entire community of Perl developers who keep sending patches to help continue improving DBD::mysql

# NAME

DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)

# SYNOPSIS

```
use DBI;

my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);

my $sth = $dbh->prepare(
    'SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM authors WHERE last_name = ?')
    or die "prepare statement failed: $dbh->errstr()";
$sth->execute('Eggers') or die "execution failed: $dbh->errstr()";
print $sth->rows . " rows found.\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
    print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, fn = $ref->{'first_name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish;
```
# EXAMPLE

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;

# Connect to the database.
my $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
                       "joe", "joe's password",
                       {'RaiseError' => 1});

# Drop table 'foo'. This may fail, if 'foo' doesn't exist
# Thus we put an eval around it.
eval { $dbh->do("DROP TABLE foo") };
print "Dropping foo failed: $@\n" if $@;

# Create a new table 'foo'. This must not fail, thus we don't
# catch errors.
$dbh->do("CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(20))");

# INSERT some data into 'foo'. We are using $dbh->quote() for
# quoting the name.
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, " . $dbh->quote("Tim") . ")");

# same thing, but using placeholders (recommended!)
$dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef, 2, "Jochen");

# now retrieve data from the table.
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM foo");
$sth->execute();
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
  print "Found a row: id = $ref->{'id'}, name = $ref->{'name'}\n";
}
$sth->finish();

# Disconnect from the database.
$dbh->disconnect();
```
# DESCRIPTION

**DBD::mysql** is the Perl5 Database Interface driver for the MySQL database. In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl programming language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the MySQL relational database management system. Most functions provided by this programming API are supported. Some rarely used functions are missing, mainly because no-one ever requested them. :-)

In what follows we first discuss the use of DBD::mysql, because this is what you will need the most. For installation, see the separate document [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod). See ["EXAMPLE"](#EXAMPLE) for a simple example above.

From perl you activate the interface with the statement

```
use DBI;
```

After that you can connect to multiple MySQL database servers and send multiple queries to any of them via a simple object oriented interface. Two types of objects are available: database handles and statement handles. Perl returns a database handle to the connect method like so:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=$db;host=$host",
  $user, $password, {RaiseError => 1});
```

Once you have connected to a database, you can execute SQL statements with:

```
  my $query = sprintf("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%d, %s)",
		      $number, $dbh->quote("name"));
  $dbh->do($query);
```

See [DBI](/pod/DBI) for details on the quote and do methods. An alternative approach is

```
  $dbh->do("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)", undef,
	   $number, $name);
```

in which case the quote method is executed automatically. See also the bind\_param method in [DBI](/pod/DBI). See ["DATABASE HANDLES"](#DATABASE-HANDLES) below for more details on database handles.

If you want to retrieve results, you need to create a so-called statement handle with:

```
$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table");
$sth->execute();
```

This statement handle can be used for multiple things. First of all you can retrieve a row of data:

```
my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref();
```

If your table has columns ID and NAME, then $row will be hash ref with keys ID and NAME. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES) below for more details on statement handles.

But now for a more formal approach:

## Class Methods

**connect**
```
use DBI;

$dsn = "DBI:mysql:$database";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname";
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port";

$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

The `database` is not a required attribute, but please note that MySQL has no such thing as a default database. If you don't specify the database at connection time your active database will be null and you'd need to prefix your tables with the database name; i.e. 'SELECT \* FROM mydb.mytable'.

This is similar to the behavior of the mysql command line client. Also, 'SELECT DATABASE()' will return the current database active for the handle.

host

port

The hostname, if not specified or specified as '' or 'localhost', will default to a MySQL server running on the local machine using the default for the UNIX socket. To connect to a MySQL server on the local machine via TCP, you must specify the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1) as the host.

Should the MySQL server be running on a non-standard port number, you may explicitly state the port number to connect to in the `hostname` argument, by concatenating the *hostname* and *port number* together separated by a colon ( `:` ) character or by using the `port` argument.

To connect to a MySQL server on localhost using TCP/IP, you must specify the hostname as 127.0.0.1 (with the optional port).

When connecting to a MySQL Server with IPv6, a bracketed IPv6 address should be used. Example DSN:

```
my $dsn = "DBI:mysql:;host=[1a12:2800:6f2:85::f20:8cf];port=3306";
```

mysql\_client\_found\_rows

If TRUE (Default), sets the CLIENT\_FOUND\_ROWS flag when connecting to MySQL. This causes UPDATE statements to return the number of rows \*matched\*, not the number of rows actually changed.

If you want the number of rows changed in response to an UPDATE statement, specify "mysql\_client\_found\_rows=0" in the DSN.

mysql\_compression

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression", then this will be used to set the compression algorithms for the connection.

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_compression=1", then the compression algorithms will be set to "zlib". This is for backwards compatibility with older versions of DBD::mysql.

mysql\_connect\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_connect\_timeout=##", the connect request to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_write\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_write\_timeout=##", the write operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_read\_timeout

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_read\_timeout=##", the read operation to the server will timeout if it has not been successful after the given number of seconds.

mysql\_init\_command

If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_init\_command=##", then this SQL statement is executed when connecting to the MySQL server. It is automatically re-executed if reconnection occurs.

mysql\_skip\_secure\_auth

This option is for older mysql databases that don't have secure auth set.

mysql\_read\_default\_file

mysql\_read\_default\_group

These options can be used to read a config file like /etc/my.cnf or ~/.my.cnf. By default MySQL's C client library doesn't use any config files unlike the client programs (mysql, mysqladmin, ...) that do, but outside of the C client library. Thus you need to explicitly request reading a config file, as in

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password)
```

The option mysql\_read\_default\_group can be used to specify the default group in the config file: Usually this is the *client* group, but see the following example:

```
[client]
host=localhost

[perl]
host=perlhost
```

(Note the order of the entries! The example won't work, if you reverse the [client] and [perl] sections!)

If you read this config file, then you'll be typically connected to *localhost*. However, by using

```
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=perl;"
    . "mysql_read_default_file=/home/joe/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
```

you'll be connected to *perlhost*. Note that if you specify a default group and do not specify a file, then the default config files will all be read. See the documentation of the C function mysql\_options() for details.

mysql\_socket

It is possible to choose the Unix socket that is used for connecting to the server. This is done, for example, with

```
mysql_socket=/dev/mysql
```

Usually there's no need for this option, unless you are using another location for the socket than that built into the client.

mysql\_ssl

A true value turns on the CLIENT\_SSL flag when connecting to the MySQL server and enforce SSL encryption. A false value (which is default) disable SSL encryption with the MySQL server.

When enabling SSL encryption you should set also other SSL options, at least mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file or mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path.

```
mysql_ssl=1 mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert=1 mysql_ssl_ca_file=/path/to/ca_cert.pem
```

This means that your communication with the server will be encrypted.

Please note that this can only work if you enabled SSL when compiling DBD::mysql; this is the default starting version 4.034. See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod) for more details.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_file

The path to a file in PEM format that contains a list of trusted SSL certificate authorities.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

mysql\_ssl\_ca\_path

The path to a directory that contains trusted SSL certificate authority certificates in PEM format.

When set MySQL server certificate is checked that it is signed by some CA certificate in the list. Common Name value is not verified unless `mysql_ssl_verify_server_cert` is enabled.

Please note that this option is supported only if your MySQL client was compiled with OpenSSL library, and not with default yaSSL library.

mysql\_ssl\_verify\_server\_cert

Checks the server's Common Name value in the certificate that the server sends to the client. The client verifies that name against the host name the client uses for connecting to the server, and the connection fails if there is a mismatch. For encrypted connections, this option helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Verification of the host name is disabled by default.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_key

The name of the SSL key file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_client\_cert

The name of the SSL certificate file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure connection.

mysql\_ssl\_cipher

A list of permissible ciphers to use for connection encryption. If no cipher in the list is supported, encrypted connections will not work.

```
mysql_ssl_cipher=AES128-SHA
mysql_ssl_cipher=DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA
```

mysql\_ssl\_optional

Setting `mysql_ssl_optional` to true disables strict SSL enforcement and makes SSL connection optional. This option opens security hole for man-in-the-middle attacks. Default value is false which means that `mysql_ssl` set to true enforce SSL encryption.

This option was introduced in 4.043 version of DBD::mysql. Due to [The BACKRONYM](http://backronym.fail/) and [The Riddle](http://riddle.link/) vulnerabilities in libmysqlclient library, enforcement of SSL encryption was not possbile and therefore `mysql_ssl_optional=1` was effectively set for all DBD::mysql versions prior to 4.043. Starting with 4.043, DBD::mysql with `mysql_ssl=1` could refuse connection to MySQL server if underlaying libmysqlclient library is vulnerable. Option `mysql_ssl_optional` can be used to make SSL connection vulnerable.

mysql\_server\_pubkey

Path to the RSA public key of the server. This is used for the sha256\_password and caching\_sha2\_password authentication plugins.

mysql\_get\_server\_pubkey

Setting `mysql_get_server_pubkey` to true requests the public RSA key of the server.

mysql\_local\_infile

The LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA may be disabled in the MySQL client library by default. If your DSN contains the option "mysql\_local\_infile=1", LOAD DATA LOCAL will be enabled. (However, this option is \*ineffective\* if the server has also been configured to disallow LOCAL.)

mysql\_multi\_statements

Support for multiple statements separated by a semicolon (;) may be enabled by using this option. Enabling this option may cause problems if server-side prepared statements are also enabled.

mysql\_server\_prepare

This option is used to enable server side prepared statements.

To use server side prepared statements, all you need to do is set the variable mysql\_server\_prepare in the connect:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost;mysql_server_prepare=1",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1 }
);
```

or:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect(
  "DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost",
  "",
  "",
  { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 1, mysql_server_prepare => 1 }
);
```

There are many benefits to using server side prepare statements, mostly if you are performing many inserts because of that fact that a single statement is prepared to accept multiple insert values.

To make sure that the 'make test' step tests whether server prepare works, you just need to export the env variable MYSQL\_SERVER\_PREPARE:

```
export MYSQL_SERVER_PREPARE=1
```

Please note that mysql server cannot prepare or execute some prepared statements. In this case DBD::mysql fallbacks to normal non-prepared statement and tries again.

mysql\_server\_prepare\_disable\_fallback

This option disable fallback to normal non-prepared statement when mysql server does not support execution of current statement as prepared.

Useful when you want to be sure that statement is going to be executed as server side prepared. Error message and code in case of failure is propagated back to DBI.

mysql\_conn\_attrs

The option <mysql\_conn\_attrs> is a hash of attribute names and values which can be used to send custom connection attributes to the server. Some attributes like '\_os', '\_platform', '\_client\_name' and '\_client\_version' are added by libmysqlclient and 'program\_name' is added by DBD::mysql.

You can then later read these attributes from the performance schema tables which can be quite helpful for profiling your database or creating statistics.

```
my $dbh= DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password,
  { AutoCommit => 0,
    mysql_conn_attrs => {
      foo => 'bar',
      wiz => 'bang'
    },
  });
```

Now you can select the results from the performance schema tables. You can do this in the same session, but also afterwards. It can be very useful to answer questions like 'which script sent this query?'.

```
my $results = $dbh->selectall_hashref(
  'SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_connect_attrs',
  'ATTR_NAME'
);
```

This returns:

```
$result = {
  'foo' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bar',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'foo',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '6'
  },
  'wiz' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'bang',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'wiz',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '3'
  },
  'program_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => './foo.pl',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => 'program_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '5'
  },
  '_client_name' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'libmysql',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_name',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '1'
  },
  '_client_version' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '5.6.24',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_client_version',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '7'
  },
  '_os' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'osx10.8',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_os',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '0'
  },
  '_pid' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => '59860',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_pid',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '2'
  },
  '_platform' => {
      'ATTR_VALUE'       => 'x86_64',
      'PROCESSLIST_ID'   => '3',
      'ATTR_NAME'        => '_platform',
      'ORDINAL_POSITION' => '4'
  }
};
```

# DATABASE HANDLES

The DBD::mysql driver supports the following attributes of database handles (read only):

```
$errno = $dbh->{'mysql_errno'};
$error = $dbh->{'mysql_error'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_hostinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_info'};
$insertid = $dbh->{'mysql_insertid'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_protoinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_serverinfo'};
$info = $dbh->{'mysql_stat'};
$threadId = $dbh->{'mysql_thread_id'};
```

These correspond to mysql\_errno(), mysql\_error(), mysql\_get\_host\_info(), mysql\_info(), mysql\_insert\_id(), mysql\_get\_proto\_info(), mysql\_get\_server\_info(), mysql\_stat() and mysql\_thread\_id(), respectively.

mysql\_clientinfo

List information of the MySQL client library that DBD::mysql was built against:

```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientinfo}\n";

8.3.0
```

mysql\_clientversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_clientversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_serverversion
```
print "$dbh->{mysql_serverversion}\n";

80300
```

mysql\_dbd\_stats
```
$info_hashref = $dbh->{mysql_dbd_stats};
```

DBD::mysql keeps track of some statistics in the mysql\_dbd\_stats attribute. The following stats are being maintained:

auto\_reconnects\_ok

The number of times that DBD::mysql successfully reconnected to the mysql server.

auto\_reconnects\_failed

The number of times that DBD::mysql tried to reconnect to mysql but failed.

The DBD::mysql driver also supports the following attributes of database handles (read/write):

mysql\_auto\_reconnect

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql will automatically reconnect to mysql if the connection be lost. This feature defaults to off; however, if either the GATEWAY\_INTERFACE or MOD\_PERL environment variable is set, DBD::mysql will turn mysql\_auto\_reconnect on. Setting mysql\_auto\_reconnect to on is not advised if 'lock tables' is used because if DBD::mysql reconnect to mysql all table locks will be lost. This attribute is ignored when AutoCommit is turned off, and when AutoCommit is turned off, DBD::mysql will not automatically reconnect to the server.

It is also possible to set the default value of the `mysql_auto_reconnect` attribute for the $dbh by passing it in the `\%attr` hash for `DBI-`connect>.

```
$dbh->{mysql_auto_reconnect} = 1;
```

or

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password, {
   mysql_auto_reconnect => 1,
});
```

Note that if you are using a module or framework that performs reconnections for you (for example [DBIx::Connector](/pod/DBIx%3A%3AConnector) in fixup mode), this value must be set to 0.

mysql\_use\_result

This attribute forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. mysql\_store\_result is the default due to that fact storing the result is expected behavior with most applications.

It is possible to set the default value of the `mysql_use_result` attribute for the $dbh via the DSN:

```
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:test;mysql_use_result=1", "root", "");
```

You can also set it after creation of the database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 0; # disable
$dbh->{mysql_use_result} = 1; # enable
```

You can also set or unset the `mysql_use_result` setting on your statement handle, when creating the statement handle or after it has been created. See ["STATEMENT HANDLES"](#STATEMENT-HANDLES).

mysql\_enable\_utf8

This attribute determines whether DBD::mysql should assume strings stored in the database are utf8. This feature defaults to off.

When set, a data retrieved from a textual column type (char, varchar, etc) will have the UTF-8 flag turned on if necessary. This enables character semantics on that string. You will also need to ensure that your database / table / column is configured to use UTF8. See for more information the chapter on character set support in the MySQL manual: <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset.html>

Additionally, turning on this flag tells MySQL that incoming data should be treated as UTF-8. This will only take effect if used as part of the call to connect(). If you turn the flag on after connecting, you will need to issue the command `SET NAMES utf8` to get the same effect.

This flag's implementation suffers the "Unicode Bug" on passed statements and input bind parameters, and cannot be fixed for historical reasons. In order to pass strings with Unicode characters consistently through DBD::mysql, you can use a "hack" workaround of calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function on scalars immediately before passing them to DBD::mysql. Calling the `utf8::upgrade()` function has absolutely no effect on (correctly written) Perl code, but forces DBD::mysql to interpret it correctly as text data to be encoded. In the same way, binary (byte) data can be passed through DBD::mysql without being encoded as text data by calling the `utf8::downgrade()` function (it dies on wide Unicode strings with codepoints above U+FF). See the following example:

```
# check that last name contains LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH STROKE (U+D8)
my $statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name LIKE '%\x{D8}%' AND first_name = ? AND data = ?";

my $wide_string_param = "Andr\x{E9}"; # Andre with LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+E9)

my $byte_param = "\x{D8}\x{A0}\x{39}\x{F8}"; # some bytes (binary data)

my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:database', 'username', 'pass', { mysql_enable_utf8mb4 => 1 });

utf8::upgrade($statement); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement);

utf8::upgrade($wide_string_param); # UTF-8 fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(1, $wide_string_param);

utf8::downgrade($byte_param); # byte fix for DBD::mysql
$sth->bind_param(2, $byte_param, DBI::SQL_BINARY); # set correct binary type

$sth->execute();

my $output = $sth->fetchall_arrayref();
# returned data in $output reference should be already UTF-8 decoded as appropriate
```

mysql\_enable\_utf8mb4

This is similar to mysql\_enable\_utf8, but is capable of handling 4-byte UTF-8 characters.

mysql\_bind\_type\_guessing

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) to attempt to guess if a value being bound is a numeric value, and if so, doesn't quote the value. This was created by Dragonchild and is one way to deal with the performance issue of using quotes in a statement that is inserting or updating a large numeric value. This was previously called `unsafe_bind_type_guessing` because it is experimental. I have successfully run the full test suite with this option turned on, the name can now be simply `mysql_bind_type_guessing`.

CAVEAT: Even though you can insert an integer value into a character column, if this column is indexed, if you query that column with the integer value not being quoted, it will not use the index:

```
mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = '3' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ref
possible_keys: value0
          key: value0
      key_len: 13
          ref: const
         rows: 1
        Extra: Using index condition
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> explain select * from test where value0 = 3
    -> \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: test
         type: ALL
possible_keys: value0
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 6
        Extra: Using where
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

See bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43822

`mysql_bind_type_guessing` can be turned on via

```
- through DSN

 my $dbh= DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
 { mysql_bind_type_guessing => 1})

 - OR after handle creation

 $dbh->{mysql_bind_type_guessing} = 1;
```

mysql\_bind\_comment\_placeholders

This attribute causes the driver (emulated prepare statements) will cause any placeholders in comments to be bound. This is not correct prepared statement behavior, but some developers have come to depend on this behavior, so I have made it available in 4.015

mysql\_no\_autocommit\_cmd

This attribute causes the driver to not issue 'set autocommit' either through explicit or using mysql\_autocommit(). This is particularly useful in the case of using MySQL Proxy.

See the bug report:

https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46308

`mysql_no_autocommit_cmd` can be turned on when creating the database handle:

```
my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'username', 'pass',
{ mysql_no_autocommit_cmd => 1});
```

or using an existing database handle:

```
$dbh->{mysql_no_autocommit_cmd} = 1;
```

ping

This can be used to send a ping to the server.

```
$rc = $dbh->ping();
```

# STATEMENT HANDLES

The statement handles of DBD::mysql support a number of attributes. You access these by using, for example,

```
my $numFields = $sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
```

Note, that most attributes are valid only after a successful *execute*. An `undef` value will returned otherwise. The most important exception is the `mysql_use_result` attribute, which forces the driver to use mysql\_use\_result rather than mysql\_store\_result. The former is faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other processes. (That's why mysql\_store\_result is the default.)

To set the `mysql_use_result` attribute, use either of the following:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("QUERY", { mysql_use_result => 1});
```

or

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
$sth->{mysql_use_result} = 1;
```

Column dependent attributes, for example *NAME*, the column names, are returned as a reference to an array. The array indices are corresponding to the indices of the arrays returned by *fetchrow* and similar methods. For example the following code will print a header of table names together with all rows:

```
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table") ||
  die "Error:" . $dbh->errstr . "\n";

$sth->execute ||  die "Error:" . $sth->errstr . "\n";

my $names = $sth->{NAME};
my $numFields = $sth->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'} - 1;
for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$names[$i]);
}
print "\n";
while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref) {
    for my $i ( 0..$numFields ) {
    printf("%s%s", $i ? "," : "", $$ref[$i]);
    }
    print "\n";
}
```

For portable applications you should restrict yourself to attributes with capitalized or mixed case names. Uppercase attribute names are in the statement handle interface described by [DBI](/pod/DBI), while lower case attribute names are private to DBD::mysql. The attribute list includes:

NAME

A reference to an array of column names, as per DBI docs.

NULLABLE

A reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that this column may contain NULL's.

NUM\_OF\_FIELDS

Number of fields returned by a *SELECT* or *LISTFIELDS* statement. You may use this for checking whether a statement returned a result: A zero value indicates a non-SELECT statement like *INSERT*, *DELETE* or *UPDATE*.

TYPE

A reference to an array of column types. The engine's native column types are mapped to portable types like DBI::SQL\_INTEGER() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(), as good as possible. Not all native types have a meaningful equivalent, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_INTERVAL is mapped to DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR(). If you need the native column types, use *mysql\_type*. See below.

ChopBlanks

this attribute determines whether a *fetchrow* will chop preceding and trailing blanks off the column values. Chopping blanks does not have impact on the *max\_length* attribute.

ParamValues

This attribute is supported as described in the DBI documentation.

It returns a hashref, the keys of which are the 'names' of the placeholders: integers starting at 1. It returns an empty hashref if the statement has no placeholders.

The values for these keys are initially undef; they are populated with `bind_param`, or when `execute` method is called with parameters. (Supplying the parameter values in the arguments to `execute` will override any previously bound values.)

After execution, it is possible to use `bind_param` to change a single parameter value and `execute` the statement again, with other values unchanged. The attribute remains properly populated after the `finish` method is called, with the values from the last execution.

mysql\_gtids

Returns GTID(s) if GTID session tracking is ensabled in the server via session\_track\_gtids.

mysql\_insertid

If the statement you executed performs an INSERT, and there is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column in the table you inserted in, this attribute holds the value stored into the AUTO\_INCREMENT column, if that value is automatically generated, by storing NULL or 0 or was specified as an explicit value.

Typically, you'd access the value via $sth->{mysql\_insertid}. The value can also be accessed via $dbh->{mysql\_insertid} but this can easily produce incorrect results in case one database handle is shared.

mysql\_is\_blob

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a blob. This attribute is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a key. This is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_is\_num

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column contains numeric values.

mysql\_is\_pri\_key

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates, that the respective column is a primary key.

mysql\_is\_auto\_increment

Reference to an array of boolean values; TRUE indicates that the respective column is an AUTO\_INCREMENT column. This is only valid for MySQL.

mysql\_length

mysql\_max\_length

A reference to an array of maximum column sizes. The *max\_length* is the maximum physically present in the result table, *length* gives the theoretically possible maximum. *max\_length* is valid for MySQL only.

mysql\_table

A reference to an array of table names, useful in a *JOIN* result.

mysql\_type

A reference to an array of MySQL's native column types, for example DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_SHORT() or DBD::mysql::FIELD\_TYPE\_STRING(). Use the *TYPE* attribute, if you want portable types like DBI::SQL\_SMALLINT() or DBI::SQL\_VARCHAR().

mysql\_type\_name

Similar to mysql, but type names and not numbers are returned. Whenever possible, the ANSI SQL name is preferred.

mysql\_warning\_count

The number of warnings generated during execution of the SQL statement. This attribute is available on both statement handles and database handles.

# TRANSACTION SUPPORT

The transaction support works as follows:

* By default AutoCommit mode is on, following the DBI specifications.
* If you execute

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  ```

  or

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 1;
  ```

  then the driver will set the MySQL server variable autocommit to 0 or 1, respectively. Switching from 0 to 1 will also issue a COMMIT, following the DBI specifications.
* The methods

  ```
  $dbh->rollback();
  $dbh->commit();
  ```

  will issue the commands ROLLBACK and COMMIT, respectively. A ROLLBACK will also be issued if AutoCommit mode is off and the database handles DESTROY method is called. Again, this is following the DBI specifications.

Given the above, you should note the following:

* You should never change the server variable autocommit manually, unless you are ignoring DBI's transaction support.
* Switching AutoCommit mode from on to off or vice versa may fail. You should always check for errors when changing AutoCommit mode. The suggested way of doing so is using the DBI flag RaiseError. If you don't like RaiseError, you have to use code like the following:

  ```
  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
  if ($dbh->{AutoCommit}) {
    # An error occurred!
  }
  ```
* If you detect an error while changing the AutoCommit mode, you should no longer use the database handle. In other words, you should disconnect and reconnect again, because the transaction mode is unpredictable. Alternatively you may verify the transaction mode by checking the value of the server variable autocommit. However, such behaviour isn't portable.
* DBD::mysql has a "reconnect" feature that handles the so-called MySQL "morning bug": If the server has disconnected, most probably due to a timeout, then by default the driver will reconnect and attempt to execute the same SQL statement again. However, this behaviour is disabled when AutoCommit is off: Otherwise the transaction state would be completely unpredictable after a reconnect.
* The "reconnect" feature of DBD::mysql can be toggled by using the [mysql\_auto\_reconnect](/pod/mysql_auto_reconnect) attribute. This behaviour should be turned off in code that uses LOCK TABLE because if the database server time out and DBD::mysql reconnect, table locks will be lost without any indication of such loss.

# MULTIPLE RESULT SETS

DBD::mysql supports multiple result sets, thanks to Guy Harrison!

The basic usage of multiple result sets is

```
do
{
  while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array())
  {
    do stuff;
  }
} while ($sth->more_results)
```

An example would be:

```
$dbh->do("drop procedure if exists someproc") or print $DBI::errstr;

$dbh->do("create procedure someproc() deterministic
 begin
 declare a,b,c,d int;
 set a=1;
 set b=2;
 set c=3;
 set d=4;
 select a, b, c, d;
 select d, c, b, a;
 select b, a, c, d;
 select c, b, d, a;
end") or print $DBI::errstr;

$sth=$dbh->prepare('call someproc()') ||
die $DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr;

$sth->execute || die DBI::err.": ".$DBI::errstr; $rowset=0;
do {
  print "\nRowset ".++$i."\n---------------------------------------\n\n";
  foreach $colno (0..$sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS}-1) {
    print $sth->{NAME}->[$colno]."\t";
  }
  print "\n";
  while (@row= $sth->fetchrow_array())  {
    foreach $field (0..$#row) {
      print $row[$field]."\t";
    }
    print "\n";
  }
} until (!$sth->more_results)
```
## Issues with multiple result sets

Please be aware there could be issues if your result sets are "jagged", meaning the number of columns of your results vary. Varying numbers of columns could result in your script crashing.

# MULTITHREADING

The multithreading capabilities of DBD::mysql depend completely on the underlying C libraries. The modules are working with handle data only, no global variables are accessed or (to the best of my knowledge) thread unsafe functions are called. Thus DBD::mysql is believed to be completely thread safe, if the C libraries are thread safe and you don't share handles among threads.

The obvious question is: Are the C libraries thread safe? In the case of MySQL the answer is yes, since MySQL 5.5 it is.

# ASYNCHRONOUS QUERIES

You can make a single asynchronous query per MySQL connection; this allows you to submit a long-running query to the server and have an event loop inform you when it's ready. An asynchronous query is started by either setting the 'async' attribute to a true value in the ["do" in DBI](/pod/DBI#do) method, or in the ["prepare" in DBI](/pod/DBI#prepare) method. Statements created with 'async' set to true in prepare always run their queries asynchronously when ["execute" in DBI](/pod/DBI#execute) is called. The driver also offers three additional methods: `mysql_async_result`, `mysql_async_ready`, and `mysql_fd`. `mysql_async_result` returns what do or execute would have; that is, the number of rows affected. `mysql_async_ready` returns true if `mysql_async_result` will not block, and zero otherwise. They both return `undef` if that handle was not created with 'async' set to true or if an asynchronous query was not started yet. `mysql_fd` returns the file descriptor number for the MySQL connection; you can use this in an event loop.

Here's an example of how to use the asynchronous query interface:

```
use feature 'say';
$dbh->do('SELECT SLEEP(10)', { async => 1 });
until($dbh->mysql_async_ready) {
  say 'not ready yet!';
  sleep 1;
}
my $rows = $dbh->mysql_async_result;
```
# INSTALLATION

See [DBD::mysql::INSTALL](/pod/distribution/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql/INSTALL.pod).

# AUTHORS

Originally, there was a non-DBI driver, Mysql, which was much like PHP drivers such as mysql and mysqli. The **Mysql** module was originally written by Andreas König <koenig@kulturbox.de> who still, to this day, contributes patches to DBD::mysql. An emulated version of Mysql was provided to DBD::mysql from Jochen Wiedmann, but eventually deprecated as it was another bundle of code to maintain.

The first incarnation of DBD::mysql was developed by Alligator Descartes, who was also aided and abetted by Gary Shea, Andreas König and Tim Bunce.

The current incarnation of **DBD::mysql** was written by Jochen Wiedmann, then numerous changes and bug-fixes were added by Rudy Lippan. Next, prepared statement support was added by Patrick Galbraith and Alexy Stroganov (who also solely added embedded server support).

For the past nine years DBD::mysql has been maintained by Patrick Galbraith (*patg@patg.net*), and recently with the great help of Michiel Beijen (*michiel.beijen@gmail.com*), along with the entire community of Perl developers who keep sending patches to help continue improving DBD::mysql
