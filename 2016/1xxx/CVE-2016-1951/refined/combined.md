GrowStuff (38.0.1\nsprpub\pr\src\io\prprf.c) can cause an overflow if the size of the existing buffer in units of bytes (maxlen) + the size of the string to be appended (len) > 0xffffffff. In this case, the function either allocates a tiny buffer or doesn't even attempt to allocate one large enough, then writes the new string beyond the buffer's end.
1081: static int GrowStuff(SprintfState \*ss, const char \*sp, PRUint32 len)
1082: {
1083: ptrdiff\_t off;
1084: char \*newbase;
1085: PRUint32 newlen;
1086:
1087: off = ss->cur - ss->base;
1088: if (off + len >= ss->maxlen) {
1089: /\* Grow the buffer \*/
1090: newlen = ss->maxlen + ((len > 32) ? len : 32);
1091: if (ss->base) {
1092: newbase = (char\*) PR\_REALLOC(ss->base, newlen);
1093: } else {
1094: newbase = (char\*) PR\_MALLOC(newlen);
1095: }
1096: if (!newbase) {
1097: /\* Ran out of memory \*/
1098: return -1;
1099: }
1100: ss->base = newbase;
1101: ss->maxlen = newlen;
1102: ss->cur = ss->base + off;
1103: }
1104:
1105: /\* Copy data \*/
1106: while (len) {
1107: --len;
1108: \*ss->cur++ = \*sp++;
...
On 32-bit platforms, line 1088 can overflow. In that case, the code doesn't allocate a new buffer, but instead writes the new data beginning just beyond the end of the existing one. Presumably this can occur only if a caller attempts to write a single very long string, because otherwise the system would run out of memory.
On 64-bit platforms, line 1088 doesn't overflow (because ptrdiff\_t isa signed 64-bit int), but line 1090 does. In that case, the code allocates a buffer that is much too small, then writes the new data far beyond its end.
The functions that use GrowStuff (PR\_vsmprintf and PR\_vsprintf\_append in prptr.c) are used in several places, but I don't know whether any of the callers ultimately derive potentially very long strings from untrusted sources.
[BTW, I notice that the new Bugzilla doesn't handle pasting of long lines as gracefully as the old one].

q1: thank you very much for the bug report.
Kai and q1: please review this patch. I check for potential
overflows before the two additions.
Note that PR\_Malloc and PR\_Realloc functions are defined to
take a PRUint32 allocation size argument. This is why the
sums must not exceed PR\_UINT32\_MAX.

Hmm, I think that the above expression is not technically safe. ptrdiff\_t is a \*signed\* type per C++11 s.5.7(5). Under 32 bit Windows, it's typedefed to int, so differences > 0x7fffffff underflow to negative values. This seems to invoke the clause of s.5.7(5) that says:
"As with any other arithmetic overflow, if the result does not fit in the space provided, the behavior is undefined."
It depends what that section means by "fit". The standards team is discussing changes to this section that would ratify my conclusion (<http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2015/n4430.html> ):
"If the expressions P and Q point to, respectively, elements i and j of the same array object, the expression P - Q has the value i - j; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. [ Note: If the value i - j is not in the range of representable values of type std::ptrdiff\_t, the behavior is undefined. — end note ]"
I \*suppose\* that, on real platforms, this expression produces the same bit pattern it would produce if ptrdiff\_t were unsigned, so this is realistically safe?
Perhaps we should disallow strings long enough to invoke this problem on any supported platform (> 0x7fffffff). If you choose to do that, I recommend using mfbt\CheckedInt.h for all calculations involved in determining buffer sizes.
>+ if (PR\_UINT32\_MAX - len < off) {
With the above provisos, I think that this is OK, though the reason is rather subtle: s.4.7(2) by way of the "usual arithmetic conversions" s.5(10):
"If the destination type is unsigned, the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source
integer (modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type). [Note: In a two’s
complement representation, this conversion is conceptual and there is no change in the bit pattern (if there
is no truncation). —end note ]"

ptrdiff\_t is defined as the type of the difference between two pointers
of the same type. So I think a C implementation needs to do whatever it
takes to prevent differences from underflowing to negative values, such
as making malloc() fail if the requested size is > 0x7fffffff under 32-bit
Windows.
I will attach a new version of the patch that doesn't allow ss->maxlen
to be > 0x7fffffff (PR\_INT32\_MAX). That will ensure ss->cur - ss->base
<= 0x7fffffff (PR\_INT32\_MAX).
Note: NSPR cannot use mfbt/CheckedInt.h. NSPR can only use system
libraries.

+ if (PR\_UINT32\_MAX - ss->maxlen < len || ss->maxlen + len > PR\_INT32\_MAX) {
I agree this code is correct.
But this code took me too long to understand. I would prefer to simplify it, to make it easier to understand for less intelligent people like me. ;-)
Given that the sum must be smaller than the signed max, we can require that each must be smaller than the signed max. If both are smaller than the signed max, the sum will be smaller than the unsigned max.
Therefore I'd prefer to rewrite the failure condition above as:
/\* If both len and maxlen are smaller than PR\_INT32\_MAX, the sum cannot overflow. \*/
if (len > PR\_INT32\_MAX || ss->maxlen > PR\_INT32\_MAX || ss->maxlen + len > PR\_INT32\_MAX) {
return -1;
}
If you don't like my code, then please add a comment to your original code like this:
/\* We require "ss->maxlen + len < PR\_UINT32\_MAX".
\* It ensures our calculation of the sum will not overflow PRUint32.
\* Rewriting the test as "PR\_UINT32\_MAX - ss->maxlen < len" ensures we don't need
\* a larger type for the test.
\*/
If you think that a rewrite or a comment is unnecessary, I'd argue, this overflow risk wasn't obvious to the original programmer, and it might not be obvious for future readers.

+ if (PR\_UINT32\_MAX - ss->maxlen < increment) {
+ /\* ss->maxlen + increment would overflow. \*/
+ return -1;
+ }
What if "ss->maxlen + 32 > PR\_INT32\_MAX",
but "ss->maxlen + len <= PR\_INT32\_MAX" ?
Do we want to detect this scenario, and only grow by len, even if "len<32" ?

Proposed patch v3
Your code looks correct to me. I believe it might be acceptable that we might not use the full size up to PR\_INT32\_MAX, but might potentially limit it to PR\_INT32\_MAX-31.
I should have your full patch first, because you added a comment to the later calculations, which made the intention clear. So, please consider to add some kind of comment to the first condition
Because I don't want to delay this fix further, r=kaie, with or without further improvements.

Since nobody has responded, and since the function PR\_vsxprintf might also be affected, and because I don't have time to fully analyze in order to write the release notes, I will use a simplified text like the following:

You can use [CVE-2016-1951](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-1951) for the CVE.

Aurora 46 has already been uplifted to use NSPR 4.12
It would be a good idea to uplift Beta 45 to NSPR 4.12, too.

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
This bug is already fixed in Firefox 46, which means we'll need it in the ESR 45.1 release to match. In terms of testing it would be better to uplift NSS 4.12 to 45 directly ([bug 1244062](/show_bug.cgi?id=1244062 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade Firefox 47 to NSPR 4.12")) now rather than do it after 45 for 45.1.

Is it ok to mention this CVE publicly and link to the commit which fixes it?
(In a public Red Hat bug that is), i am asking because there is no mention on the CVE id in the release notes or anywhere else and it makes little sense to keep this private now.

Because we haven't shipped a release with this fixed yet. This is fixed in Firefox 46. We just shipped 45.
So, when 46 comes out, this will be in an advisory then.
As a sec-moderate, it is unlikely to be taken into an ESR release as well.

Al, I think the above is wrong.
This bug is fixed in NSPR 4.12.
NSPR 4.12 is already used by Firefox ESR 45.
The upgrade was done in [bug 1244062](/show_bug.cgi?id=1244062 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade Firefox 47 to NSPR 4.12").
See this page for an overview of NSPR/NSS versions used in the Firefox branches:

[Comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1174015#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Overflow in prprf/GrowStuff can cause memory-safety bug") from you stated that NSPR 4.12 needed uplift to Beta. No one ever said differently in this bug so, without going digging on my own, I had no idea this was fixed in 45...

Yes, I'm aware of this but when I have comments in a bug saying "We should maybe take this on beta", that implies it isn't on beta (which is 45) and then no one said otherwise.

A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

# USN-3023-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

18 July 2016

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

It was discovered that NSPR incorrectly handled memory allocation. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1951](/security/CVE-2016-1951))

Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Timothy Nikkel,

Sylvestre Ledru, Julian Seward, Olli Pettay, and Karl Tomlinson,

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2818](/security/CVE-2016-2818))

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
