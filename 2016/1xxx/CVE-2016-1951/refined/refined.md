Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `GrowStuff` function within the `prprf.c` file of the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) library. This function is responsible for dynamically growing a buffer when appending data to it. The core issue is an integer overflow in the calculations involved in determining the new buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Integer Overflow:**
    *   On 32-bit platforms, the calculation `off + len` in line 1088 can overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value of `ptrdiff_t`, which is a signed integer type. When this overflow occurs the code does not reallocate the buffer and proceeds with writing past the buffer limit.
    *   On 64-bit platforms, the calculation `ss->maxlen + ((len > 32) ? len : 32)` can overflow in line 1090 if `ss->maxlen` and the added length (either `len` or 32)  exceeds the maximum value of a 32 bit unsigned integer. This leads to allocating too small buffer, which is followed by an out-of-bounds write.

2. **Out-of-bounds Write:** When an integer overflow occurs, the code either allocates a buffer that is too small or does not allocate a new one at all, and then proceeds to write beyond the boundaries of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Writing beyond the buffer boundary can corrupt memory, potentially leading to a crash or unpredictable behavior.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can cause a denial of service via application crash.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If exploited successfully, the memory corruption could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by carefully crafting input to overwrite critical data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by calling functions that use `GrowStuff`, primarily `PR_vsmprintf` and `PR_vsprintf_append`.
*   Attackers can exploit this by providing specially crafted input strings to these functions that would lead to an integer overflow during buffer size calculations and subsequent out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input that will eventually be passed to `PR_vsmprintf` or `PR_vsprintf_append` with the length and the content of the string controlled by the attacker
*   The attacker would have to craft input to cause an integer overflow and the subsequent out-of-bounds write. This likely requires a good understanding of the underlying code, memory layout and the platform being targeted.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug report mentions that the functions using `GrowStuff` are used in several places, but it was not immediately known if any callers ultimately derive potentially very long strings from untrusted sources.
*   The fix implemented checks for potential overflows before performing the additions. The `maxlen` member of the `SprintfState` is limited to `PR_INT32_MAX`.
*   The vulnerability affects both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
*   The fix was incorporated into NSPR 4.12 and uplifted to Firefox ESR 45.
