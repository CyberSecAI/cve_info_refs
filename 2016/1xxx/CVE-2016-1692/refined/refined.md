  "CVE-2016-1692": {
    "description": "WebKit/Source/core/css/StyleSheetContents.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.63, permits cross-origin loading of CSS stylesheets by a ServiceWorker even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect MIME type, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Blink handles CSS stylesheets loaded by a ServiceWorker. It does not enforce the correct MIME type when fetching CSS stylesheets from cross-origin sources, allowing a bypass of the Same Origin Policy.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-origin bypass",
        "Incorrect MIME type handling",
        "Same Origin Policy violation"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass the Same Origin Policy, allowing them to inject malicious CSS or perform other actions that would normally be restricted by the SOP.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can create a crafted web site that loads CSS stylesheets using a ServiceWorker, even if the stylesheet has an incorrect MIME type.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and have the victim visit it in a vulnerable browser."
