Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference in the `AppleGraphicsDeviceControl` component. Specifically, the `AppleGraphicsDeviceControlClient` does not validate if its pointer to the `IOService` (located at `this+0xd8`) is non-null before using it in its external methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is the lack of a check for a null pointer before dereferencing it. This allows an attacker to control the instruction pointer (RIP) by mapping the null page in userspace which is then dereferenced.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting a race condition between two threads. One thread closes the `IOService` connection, which sets the mentioned pointer to NULL, while the other simultaneously attempts to make an external method call, triggering the dereference of the now-null pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain control over the kernel's instruction pointer (RIP). This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges and potentially achieve full system compromise.
- **Denial of Service:** If the null pointer dereference is triggered without mapping the null page, it can lead to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The exploit requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target machine to trigger the race condition.
- The attacker needs to be able to map the null page in userspace in order to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the race condition using threads, `IOServiceClose`, and an external method call through `IOConnectCallMethod`.
- The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on OS X 10.11.4 (15E65).
- The advisory from Apple mentions that the vulnerability is fixed with "improved validation".
