Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-1699:

**1. Root cause of the vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability lies in the DevTools subsystem of Blink (the rendering engine used by Chrome). Specifically, the `WebKit/Source/devtools/front_end/devtools.js` file does not properly sanitize the `remoteFrontendUrl` parameter. This allows an attacker to provide a crafted URL that bypasses intended access restrictions.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   -  **Parameter sanitization failure**: The `remoteFrontendUrl` parameter was not being properly validated to ensure it points to a `chrome-devtools-frontend.appspot.com` URL. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious URLs.
   - **Access Restriction Bypass**: By providing a malicious URL via the `remoteFrontendUrl` parameter, attackers could bypass intended access restrictions in DevTools.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Integrity Impact**: The primary impact is the potential to modify the behavior of the DevTools, potentially leading to unexpected or unwanted actions within the browserâ€™s development tools environment.
   -  While the information suggests integrity impact (I:P/I:H), it does not specify that it will enable arbitrary code execution, it primarily states it's an access bypass.

**4. Attack vectors:**
   - **Network**: The vulnerability is triggered via network requests. An attacker could craft a URL containing a malicious `remoteFrontendUrl` parameter.
   -  **User interaction Required**: User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. The user must be tricked into clicking or following the crafted URL.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to get a user to click a crafted link. This could be accomplished via a phishing attack, malicious advertising, or similar methods.
   -  No special privileges are required for the attacker to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
  - The vulnerability is addressed in Google Chrome version 51.0.2704.79
  - SUSE rates this issue as having "moderate" severity
  - Red Hat also lists this vulnerability as "Important"
