Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `fillColor` attribute within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. By crafting a specific array for the `fillColor` attribute, an attacker can trigger the reuse of a dangling pointer after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free: The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory is accessed after it has been deallocated. This leads to the corruption of the heap and the potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the current user.
- System Compromise: This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF Files: An attacker could embed the crafted `fillColor` attribute within a malicious PDF document.
- Malicious Web Pages: An attacker could also host a malicious page that leverages the vulnerability when rendered in the context of the Adobe Acrobat plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: The attacker needs the victim to either open a specially crafted malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page.
- Ability to create a malicious PDF or web page with the specific `fillColor` attribute exploit.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `fillColor` attribute is set to a crafted array.
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of HPE Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe has released an update to address the vulnerability, and the update has been classified as priority 2.
