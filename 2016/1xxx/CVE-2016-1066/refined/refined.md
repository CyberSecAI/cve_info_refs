Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1066:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in how Adobe Acrobat Pro DC handles ListBox fields. Specifically, a specially crafted ListBox with a "Selection Change" action can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after the memory it points to has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:**  The core issue is the use of a pointer after the memory it references has been deallocated. This leads to unpredictable behavior and potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The code runs with the privileges of the current user running the Adobe Acrobat application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker can embed the malicious ListBox within a specially crafted PDF file and then entice the victim to open the file.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious web page that causes the PDF to be rendered in the context of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, meaning they do not need physical access to the victim's machine.
*   **User Interaction:**  The victim must interact with the malicious content (e.g., opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious website).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in Adobe Acrobat and Reader updates released on May 5, 2016.
*   The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['23937'].

This information aligns with the typical characteristics of a use-after-free vulnerability, which can allow for arbitrary code execution if properly exploited.
