- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An issue existed when searching for scripting libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Quarantined applications could potentially override OSA script libraries installed by the user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A quarantined application could potentially override OSA script libraries installed by the user.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs when a quarantined application attempts to utilize OSA scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application that is quarantined and can attempt to override system script libraries.
