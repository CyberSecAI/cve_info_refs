Open any page with WebGL content or test with:  <http://get.webgl.org/> <http://webglreport.com/>  2. Check chrome://flags - yes, Override software rendering list is Enabled but that doesn't help  3. Check the same thing in Google Chrome and Firefox  4. Compare chrome://gpu in Google Chrome and Chromium (screenshots attached)  WebGL doesn't work in Chromium but works in Google Chrome (and Firefox). Also hardware acceleration is unavailable in Chromium for some reason although both Chromium and Google Chrome use identical settings.  I am attaching screenshots of chrome://gpu output from both Google Chrome and Chromium for comparison. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c1)  Deleted Name   2016-02-09 10:03:56 UTC  ``` Just tested with Chromium version 48.0.2564.103 from  [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/chromium/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network%3A/chromium/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/)  The issue remains. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c2)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 09:32:22 UTC  ``` It seems I am again being sent back from code.google.com to here:  <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=585046#c6>  They say "We don't provide support for those - please file a bug with your distribution, or reproduce the issue with your own build." ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c3)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 10:34:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Name Deleted from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c2)) > It seems I am again being sent back from code.google.com to here: >  > <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=585046#c6> >  > They say "We don't provide support for those - please file a bug with your > distribution, or reproduce the issue with your own build."  Looks like the same issue as in [Bug#966082](show_bug.cgi?id=966082 "RESOLVED FIXED - chromium: sandbox related stacktrace printed").  Btw, do you have vdpau-video installed?

That bug is marked as fixed but it seems it is not.  That bug has only been fixed for 13.2 by not patching chromium to use libva any more on 13.2. But you are using Leap 42.1, no?  The stacktrace is exactly the same... I suppose it happens because libva fails to open the driver: libva info: VA-API version 0.38.0 libva info: va_getDriverName() returns 0 libva info: Trying to open /usr/lib64/dri/nvidia_drv_video.so libva info: va_openDriver() returns -1 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c6)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 11:22:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Bauer from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c5)) > That bug has only been fixed for 13.2 by not patching chromium to use libva > any more on 13.2. > But you are using Leap 42.1, no?  Thanks for explaining.  Yes, I am using Leap 42.1. I hope you can fix this :) ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c7)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 11:28:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Name Deleted from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c6)) > Yes, I am using Leap 42.1. I hope you can fix this :)  I'm not a chromium maintainer.  But it seems like it would be a good idea to remove libva support completely again. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c8)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 11:32:05 UTC  ``` I hope someone else can do it then. Thanks. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c9)  Forgotten User sM9JzehKpy   2016-02-13 11:48:06 UTC  ``` Ok. I removed the libva patch completely. I wasn't really happy with this patch in the first place, but the submitter indicated that it wouldn't do any harm and that he tested, etc.   Unfortunately it seems that this might be true on Tumbleweed, but for the older builds this is definitely not the case. Also I know already that future chromium builds will no longer build with this patch, so it was just a matter of time before it got disabled.   As soon as the build in network:chromium is finished, I will push it out as a maintenance update. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c10)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 11:50:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Raymond Wooninck from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c9)) > As soon as the build in network:chromium is finished, I will push it out as > a maintenance update.  Sounds great Raymond! Thanks a lot. Looking forward to it. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c11)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 11:59:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Raymond Wooninck from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c9)) > Unfortunately it seems that this might be true on Tumbleweed, but for the > older builds this is definitely not the case.  Well, it might also depend on the actual graphics card/driver that's being used, I suppose... ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c12)  Deleted Name   2016-02-13 12:04:11 UTC  ``` In my particular case it is GTX680 with latest drivers from nVidia. But I suppose this is visible on the screenshots. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=965566#c13)  Deleted Name   2016-02-15 14:12:45 UTC  ``` I have just upgraded to chromium-48.0.2564.103-830.2.x86_64  Visiting chrome://gpu now shows that hardware acceleration is working. Thanks!

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [6 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-2-M48&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

Thanks for testing. At least we can rule out the system libs.   This leaves only one thing that could cause this and this would be the patch that activates libva (VAAPI) support. Also [comment#3](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c3) points towards this as that it seems GPU related.   As that this issue does not occur on Leap nor Tumbleweed, I will change the logic in the spec-file to not apply the patch on openSUSE 13.2. Once it got build we can test again.   Thanks ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c6)  Forgotten User sM9JzehKpy   2016-02-11 20:19:38 UTC  ``` Andreas,  Could you have a look with the latest build in network:chromium for openSUSE 13.2 ?  IF this still generates the issue, then it must be a kernel issue as that the build is then equal to the ones delivered before the kernel updates.   Thanks ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2016-02-12 16:50:17 UTC  ``` That fixes the issue, message no longer printed with that build.  $ rpm -q --changelog chromium | head -n3 * Thu Feb 11 2016 tittiatcoke@gmail.com - Don't build with libva support for openSUSE 13.2 and lower   ([boo#966082](http://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=966082))  $ rpm -q chromium chromium-48.0.2564.103-828.1.x86_64 ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c8)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 10:34:47 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 965566](show_bug.cgi?id=965566 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebGL and hardware acceleration not available in Chromium") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c9)  Wolfgang Bauer   2016-02-13 10:36:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Bauer from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c8)) > *** [Bug 965566](show_bug.cgi?id=965566 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebGL and hardware acceleration not available in Chromium") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***  Apparently this is not only an issue on 13.2, but also Leap 42.1... ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c10)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-02-15 15:00:30 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (966082) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/359487> 13.1 / chromium ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=966082#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-02-17 11:14:20 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:0491-1: An update that fixes 6 vulnerabilities is now available.
