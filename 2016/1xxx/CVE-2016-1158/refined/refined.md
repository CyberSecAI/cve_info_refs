Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions they do not intend to perform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Corega wireless LAN routers do not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
- This is classified as CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If a user is logged into the router's management interface and visits a malicious web page, the attacker can perform administrative functions on the router.
- The impact includes potential manipulation of the device settings, leading to a confidentiality and integrity impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can initiate the attack remotely over the network.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), where the victim needs to be logged into the management interface and then tricked into visiting a malicious website or link.
- Attack complexity is low, it does not require any special configurations from the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication (PR:N) to the vulnerable device to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content to trick the user.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3:**
    *   **Base Score:** 7.1
    *   **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
    *   This indicates a high severity vulnerability exploitable over the network with low attack complexity and no required privileges. It requires user interaction, and has high confidentiality and low integrity impact.

*   **CVSS v2:**
    *   **Base Score:** 4.0
    *  **Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N
    *  This indicates a medium severity vulnerability with network access, high attack complexity, no authentication required, and partial confidentiality and integrity impact.
