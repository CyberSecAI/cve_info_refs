Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-ipp>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they have web access enabled and are running a firmware release earlier than the first fixed release for that device:    + IP Phone 7811, 7821, 7841, and 7861 Desktop Phones   + IP Phone 8811, 8841, 8845, 8851, 8861, and 8865 Desktop Phones   + Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX **Note:** Web access is disabled by default. Administrators can check the web access configuration from Cisco Unified Communications Manager by choosing **Device > Phone > Select a Phone** and checking whether **Web Access** is set to *Enabled* or *Disabled*. If it is set to *Disabled*, the IP phone is not vulnerable.  For information about which Cisco firmware releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + ATA 190 Analog Telephone Adapter   + ATA 191 Analog Telephone Adapter   + ATA 192 Multiplatform Analog Telephone Adapter   + IP Conference Phone 7832   + IP Conference Phone 7832 with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Conference Phone 8832   + IP Conference Phone 8832 with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP DECT 6825 with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 6821, 6841, 6851, 6861, and 6871 with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 7811, 7821, 7841, and 7861 Desktop Phones with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 8811, 8841, 8845, 8851, 8861, and 8865 Desktop Phones with Multiplatform Firmware   + SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapter   + SPA122 ATA with Router   + SPA2102 Phone Adapter with Router   + SPA232D Multi-Line DECT ATA   + SPA3102 Voice Gateway with Router   + SPA8000 8-Port IP Telephony Gateway   + SPA8800 IP Telephony Gateway with 4 FXS and 4 FXO Ports   + Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones   + Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones   + Unified IP Conference Phone 8831   + Unified IP Conference Phone 8831 for Third-Party Call Control   + Unified IP Phone 6901 and 6911   + Unified SIP Phone 3905  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  However, if web access is not required, disabling it is considered a mitigation for this vulnerability. If web access is disabled, the phone is not vulnerable. For additional information, see the Web Access Disable chapter of the [Phone Hardening](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/security/11_0_1/secugd/CUCM_BK_C1A78C1D_00_cucm-security-guide-1101/phone_hardening.pdf) guide.  **Note:** Web access is disabled by default on Cisco IP phones.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

#### Description

A vulnerability in the web server for Cisco IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web server of a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a DoS condition.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 9.8 |

# Cisco IP Phones Web Server Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While conducting research on a Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821, Tenable discovered a couple of vulnerabilities affecting numerous Cisco IP Phone models.

#### CVE-2020-3161: Unauthenticated Stack-Based Buffer Overflow

An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a crafted HTTP request to the */deviceconfig/setActivationCode* endpoint. In *libHTTPService.so*, the parameters after */deviceconfig/setActivationCode* are used to create a new URI via a *sprintf* function call. The length of the parameter string is not checked. When an attacker provides a long parameter string then sprintf overflows the provided stack-based buffer. This results in a crash of the device or could potentially allow for remote code execution.

A denial of service proof of concept can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/cisco/ip_phone/cve_2020_3161.txt).

#### CVE-2016-1421: Unauthenticated Stack-Based Buffer Overflow

An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a crafted HTTP request to the */CGI/CallInfo* endpoint. In *libHTTPService.so*, the parameters after */CGI/CallInfo* are appended to a stack buffer using strcat. The length of the parameter string is not checked. When an attacker provides a long parameter string, strcat overflows the buffer. This results in a crash of the device or could potentially allow for remote code execution.

A denial of service proof of concept can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/cisco/ip_phone/cve_2016_1421.txt).

During Tenable's original analysis, they noted the similarity of this vulnerability to [CSCuz03016](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz03016/?rfs=iqvred). However, Cisco's advisory described the vulnerability as requiring authentication, DoS only, and the Wireless IP Phone 8821 wasn't listed on the affected list. After disclosing to Cisco, they informed Tenable that the described bug was CVE-2016-1421 and subsequently updated their disclosure.

### Solution

Upgrade to the following versions or later:

* IP Phone 78xx: 11.7(1)
* IP Phone 88xx: 11.7(1)
* Unified IP Conference Phone 8831: 10.3(1)SR6
* Wireless IP Phone 8821, 8821-EX: 11.0(5)SR3
