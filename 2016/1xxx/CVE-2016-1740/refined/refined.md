Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1740:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that exists in the `FontParser` component of multiple Apple operating systems. This issue arises during the parsing of font data within PDF files, specifically when the encoded fonts contain invalid characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: The primary weakness is that a malformed PDF file can cause memory corruption when parsing the font data. This can lead to various outcomes depending on the specific memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected device or system, depending on the user's permissions.
- Unexpected application termination: In some cases, exploitation might cause the application parsing the PDF file to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted PDF file: The attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file.
- User interaction is required: The user has to either visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable code to parse a crafted PDF file, or open a local malicious PDF file.
- Remote execution: An attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening the malicious file or webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malformed PDF file: The attacker needs the capability to craft a PDF file with invalid font data designed to trigger the memory corruption.
- Social engineering: To achieve exploitation, the attacker may need to socially engineer a user to open or view the malicious PDF file/webpage.
- No special privileges needed: Exploitation does not appear to require special system privileges prior to exploitation.

**Affected Systems**
Based on the provided documents this vulnerability affects:
- watchOS 2.2 (Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Edition, and Apple Watch Hermes)
- tvOS 9.2 (Apple TV 4th generation)
- iOS 9.3 (iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch 5th generation and later, iPad 2 and later)
- OS X El Capitan v10.11 to v10.11.3

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by HappilyCoded (ant4g0nist and r3dsm0k3) working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Apple addressed the vulnerability in updates for its operating systems by improved memory handling.
