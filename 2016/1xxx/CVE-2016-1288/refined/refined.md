Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-1288:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the web proxy framework of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of HTTPS packets.
- It involves a flaw in how the WSA handles secure connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The device becomes unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to negotiate a secure connection (HTTPS) from within the trusted network to the vulnerable WSA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to establish a secure connection to the WSA from within the trusted network. This implies the attacker must be able to reach the web proxy interface of the WSA.
- No authentication is required for this attack.
- The attacker does not need specific knowledge of the network or device other than its reachability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), both virtual and hardware versions, running AsyncOS prior to 8.5.3-051 and 9.0.0-485.
- The HTTPS Proxy feature must be enabled on the WSA for it to be affected.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to the fixed versions of software.
- Cisco has provided software updates that address the vulnerability in versions 8.5.3-051 and later, and 9.0.0-485 and later.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity, with a CVSS base score of 7.8 and a temporal score of 6.4.
- The Exploitability (E) metric is "Functional" meaning functional exploit code is available.
- The Remediation Level (RL) is "Official Fix" meaning a complete vendor solution is available.
- The Report Confidence (RC) is "Confirmed" meaning the vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability.
