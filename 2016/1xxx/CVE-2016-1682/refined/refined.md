  "CVE-2016-1682": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ServiceWorkerContainer::registerServiceWorkerImpl function in WebKit/Source/modules/serviceworkers/ServiceWorkerContainer.cpp in Blink does not enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) checks during ServiceWorker registration.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A CSP bypass vulnerability is present that allows a remote attacker to circumvent CSP protections.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions, potentially leading to various forms of attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) by loading and executing malicious scripts that would otherwise be blocked.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by registering a service worker that violates CSP through a crafted website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a specially crafted website."
