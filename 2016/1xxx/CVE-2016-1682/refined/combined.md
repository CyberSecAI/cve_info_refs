Huh, I didn't know you could install a service worker via an HTTP header... I agree with you that it's probably outside the threat model of CSP, but I'm not sure. Mike, maybe CSP3 should say something about how CSP should be applied when loading the main script for a service worker? (If it doesn't already)  If we wanted to apply CSP checks for a SW loaded from an HTTP header, seems like that would be tricky with how things are set up right now. We are planning to move CSP checks into the browser process at some point, at which point it would probably be much simpler to enforce them for SWs installed via Link. ```     | **falken** | | lgtm with question Should we also check CSP on importScripts() in the service worker script? ... | | --- | | 4 years, 8 months ago (2016-04-07 05:06:08 UTC) [#5](#msg5) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` lgtm with question  Should we also check CSP on importScripts() in the service worker script?

That may already work.  That should be covered by the Service Worker's `script-src` directive. I doubt we have a test for it, but it Should Totally Work(tm).  > I wonder how this would/should work for service workers installed via a Link: rel=serviceworker http header  If/when we start processing CSP in the browser, we'll need to process it before triggering requests via `Link` headers. This is more or less the same thing we need to do for `frame-ancestor`, just in a different place. That's not something we're capable of doing today, for better or worse. ```     | **estark** | | Thanks both.

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass

Content Security Policy (CSP) protections. ([CVE-2016-1682](/security/CVE-2016-1682))

An out-of-bounds memory access was discovered in libxslt. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1683](/security/CVE-2016-1683))

An integer overflow was discovered in libxslt. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash or resource

consumption). ([CVE-2016-1684](/security/CVE-2016-1684))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the regular expression

implementation in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2016-1688](/security/CVE-2016-1688))

A heap overflow was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-1689](/security/CVE-2016-1689))

A heap overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-1691](/security/CVE-2016-1691))

It was discovered that Blink permits cross-origin loading of stylesheets

by a service worker even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect

MIME type. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1692](/security/CVE-2016-1692))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1695](/security/CVE-2016-1695),

[CVE-2016-1703](/security/CVE-2016-1703))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent frame navigation during

DocumentLoader detach operations. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1697](/security/CVE-2016-1697))

A parameter sanitization bug was discovered in the devtools subsystem in

Blink. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended

access restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1699](/security/CVE-2016-1699))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[614767](https://crbug.com/614767)] CVE-2016-1695: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). Â If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). Â The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
