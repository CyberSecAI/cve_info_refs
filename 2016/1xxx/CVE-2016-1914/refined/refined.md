  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2016-1914",
      "root_cause": "The Java servlet `com.rim.mdm.ui.server.ImageServlet` is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `imageName` parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unauthenticated SQL injection",
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Full read/write access to the database, potentially leading to command execution via `xp_cmdshell` (depending on database user configuration). XSS allows malicious JavaScript to perform any action within the application that the targeted user is able to, potentially compromising the administrative web application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable servlet with a malicious SQL payload in the `imageName` parameter.",
        "Crafting a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `locale` parameter"
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated for SQL injection and needs to convince a user to click a crafted link for XSS."
