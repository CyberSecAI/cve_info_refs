| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1393783#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-10 10:43:04 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of Fedora.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.  [bug automatically created by: add-tracking-bugs]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1393783#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-10 10:43:10 UTC  ```  Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1393780,1393783  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [CVE-2016-1841](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-1841)  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1393783#c2)  Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client    2017-01-05 20:58:12 UTC  ``` This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1393783#c3)  Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client    2017-01-05 21:11:01 UTC  ``` This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.

Approximately 2 (two) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 24. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '24'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 24 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1393783#c5)  Jan Kurik    2017-08-08 11:29:52 UTC  ``` Fedora 24 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2017-08-08. Fedora 24 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates.  As this is a security big we are moving this bug to the currently latest supported release. Please check whether this bug is still applicable.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1393783#c6)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:10:08 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '25'.

In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.  [1] <https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1736>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1393783#c8)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 15:09:32 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life.
