Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1621:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how libvpx, a video codec library, parses certain specially crafted Opus WebM files. This parsing issue leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability during the parsing of specifically crafted Opus WebM files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver has access to audio and video streams and other privileges, so successful exploitation could lead to significant compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation can occur through various methods, including:
    - Processing malicious media files received via MMS.
    - Playing malicious media files through a web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted Opus WebM file to a vulnerable device. This could be achieved through methods like MMS or through a website visited by the user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided data confirms that the vulnerability is in libvpx.
- The fix involves updating the mkparser, which is responsible for parsing the media files.
- The issue is considered critical due to the possibility of remote code execution within the context of mediaserver.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Android (4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0).
