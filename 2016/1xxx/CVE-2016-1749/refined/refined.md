Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-1749:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking in the `AppleUSBPipe::Abort` function, which is accessible through the `IOUSBInterfaceUserClient`'s external method 36, `_AbortStreamPipe`. This function uses a user-supplied scalar value as an index to access an array of C++ objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the missing bounds check on the user-controlled index. This allows reading arbitrary memory locations.
- **Null pointer dereference:** There is no check if the array pointer itself is valid. If the array pointer is NULL, the code will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer leading to a crash or potentially further exploitation.
- **Controlled kernel memory access:** By providing a specific index, an attacker can cause the kernel to dereference a controllable userspace address. The provided proof-of-concept uses `0xf0f0f0f0` which will lead to reading an IOKit object pointer from address `0x787878780`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context, which allows for complete system compromise
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can escalate privileges from a regular user to kernel level.
- **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service through a crash if the null pointer is dereferenced

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **IOKit API:** The exploit utilizes the IOKit API to interact with the vulnerable `IOUSBInterfaceUserClient` service.
- **User Interaction:** The ZDI advisory notes that user interaction is required in the form of visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file. However the provided exploit code does not require any user interaction beyond running the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Knowledge of IOKit:** The attacker needs knowledge of the IOKit API and the vulnerable service/method.
- **Code execution on the target system:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code maps a page at address `0x787878000` to demonstrate control of a kernel object pointer.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero, and Juwei Lin of Trend Micro.
- Apple addressed this vulnerability in OS X El Capitan v10.11.4 and Security Update 2016-002.
- The vulnerability affects OS X El Capitan v10.11 to v10.11.3

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, providing specifics about the vulnerable function, the lack of bounds checking, and the controlled memory access leading to a kernel code execution vulnerability.
