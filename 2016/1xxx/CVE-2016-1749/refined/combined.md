# Apple Mac OSX Kernel - Code Execution Due to Lack of Bounds Checking in AppleUSBPipe::Abort

#### EDB-ID:

###### 39607

#### CVE:

###### [2016-1749](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1749)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

#### Platform:

###### [OSX](/?platform=osx)

#### Date:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=728

External Method 36 of IOUSBInterfaceUserClient is _AbortStreamPipe.

It takes two scalar inputs and uses the second one as an array index to read a pointer
to a C++ object without checking the bounds then calls a virtual method on it.

Furthermore there's no check that the array pointer is non-null; if it is then we can get a
controlled offset-from-zero read; since our controlled dword will be multiplied by 8 to
index the array this means we can easily get the kernel to dereference a controllable
userspace address.

In this case a value of 0xf0f0f0f0 leads to the kernel reading an IOKit object pointer from
0x787878780. This poc maps that page to demonstrate control of a kernel object pointer.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Advisory Details

March 22nd, 2016
## Apple OS X IOUSBInterfaceUserClient Out-Of-Bounds Indexing Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-16-206ZDI-CAN-3530

| CVE ID | [CVE-2016-1749](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-1749) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.9, [AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Apple](http://www.apple.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the IOUSBInterfaceUserClient interface. The issue lies in the failure to ensure that a user-supplied index is within the bounds of the allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this to escalate their privileges and execute code under the context of the kernel. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2016-02-04 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2016-03-22 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
