Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a default decryption key within Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution (LMS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of a default, hardcoded cryptographic key to encrypt sensitive data within the LMS databases. This violates the principle of using unique, randomly generated keys per installation.
- The vulnerability is a CWE-200: Information Exposure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can decrypt and access data fields within the LMS databases.
- This allows access to sensitive information used to manage devices in Cisco networks.
- The impact is rated as "Partial" for both Confidentiality and Integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is "Local," meaning the attacker needs local access to the system where LMS is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an "Authenticated" user on the local system where Cisco Prime LMS is running.
- They need to have knowledge of the default decryption key used by the software.

**CVSS Metrics:**
-   **Base Score:** 3.0
    -   Access Vector (AV): Local
    -   Access Complexity (AC): Medium
    -   Authentication (Au): Single
    -   Confidentiality Impact (C): Partial
    -   Integrity Impact (I): Partial
    -   Availability Impact (A): None
-   **Temporal Score:** 2.8
    -   Exploitability (E): Functional
    -   Remediation Level (RL): Unavailable
    -   Report Confidence (RC): Confirmed

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory states that all versions of Cisco Prime LMS are affected.
*   There are no available workarounds.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public exploits.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
