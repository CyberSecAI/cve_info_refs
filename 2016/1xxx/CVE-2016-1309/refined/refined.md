Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the web framework code of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, categorized as CWE-79. This means an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated remote attacker can conduct an XSS attack against users of the affected system's web interface.
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, and data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack can be carried out remotely by an attacker who does not need to be authenticated to the system.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious crafted input to the vulnerable web interface.
*   The attacker does not need any specific position on the network. They only need to be able to reach the web interface of the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server.

**Affected Products**
* Cisco WebEx Meetings Server Release 2.6.1.39 (2.6 FCS)
* Cisco WebEx Meetings Server Release 2.5.1.29 (2.5 FCS)

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 4.3 and a Temporal Score of 4.1. The vector string is AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, emphasizing the need for patching.
*   **Fixed Software:** Users are advised to consult Cisco's security advisories and responses for information on fixed software versions.
*   **Reporting:** Cisco thanks Adam Willard of Raytheon Foreground Security for reporting the vulnerability.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, which usually just specifies the vulnerability type and affected products. This content includes the specific root cause (web framework code), the attack vector (unauthenticated remote access via web interface), and the impact of exploitation (XSS leading to code execution).
