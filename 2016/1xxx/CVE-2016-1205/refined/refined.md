Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw within the "category\_freearea\_ addition\_plugin" and "itemdetail\_freearea\_ addition\_plugin" plugins for EC-CUBE, both developed by shiro8 Co., Ltd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages. This is a classic example of a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's browser session. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Hijacking user accounts.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would typically craft a malicious URL or embed the malicious script in a link, which, when clicked by a user, would execute the script within the context of the vulnerable website. 
The attacker could potentially leverage social engineering to trick the user into interacting with the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker does not need any special privileges on the affected system. They need to be able to craft a malicious request that includes the malicious script and trick the victim into loading it. The attacker can be remote and doesn't need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability. However, the attack requires user interaction for the malicious script to be executed.

**Summary of CVE-2016-1205:**

The JVN reports describe a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) affecting the `category_freearea_addition_plugin` and `itemdetail_freearea_addition_plugin` for EC-CUBE. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into the plugin which would be executed when a user visits a page. This can result in actions like session hijacking, account takeovers, or data theft. The attack is network based and requires user interaction to trigger, and doesn't require attacker authentication. The fix is to update the vulnerable plugins to the latest version.
