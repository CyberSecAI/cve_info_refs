- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A programming error in the FreeBSD kernel when processing a TCP connection with both `TCP_MD5SIG` and `TCP_NOOPT` socket options set.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of TCP connections using both `TCP_MD5SIG` (TCP MD5 signature) and `TCP_NOOPT` (no TCP options) socket options.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - A local attacker can crash the kernel, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).
    - A remote attack is theoretically possible if a server has a listening socket with `TCP_NOOPT` set and is either out of SYN cache entries or the SYN cache is disabled.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local: Triggering the vulnerability locally by creating a socket with the described options.
    - Remote: Sending packets to a vulnerable server that has a listening socket with `TCP_NOOPT` set and is either out of SYN cache or has the SYN cache disabled, forcing the code path that leads to the crash.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Local: Ability to create sockets and set options.
    - Remote: Ability to send TCP packets to the target system, and the target server must meet specific criteria (have a listening socket with `TCP_NOOPT`, and either be out of SYN cache entries, or SYN cache disabled).
