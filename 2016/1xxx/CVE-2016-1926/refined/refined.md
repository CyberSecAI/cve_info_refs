Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1926:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is improper escaping of the `aggregate_type` parameter in an AJAX request to the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) web interface. Specifically, the value of the `aggregate_type` parameter was directly embedded into JavaScript code without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. By crafting a malicious `aggregate_type` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing user cookies and authentication tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   The impact was considered Low, with a CVSS score of 1.9, likely because exploiting it requires some user interaction or specific setup of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/omp` endpoint of the GSA.
*   The attacker needs to manipulate the `aggregate_type` parameter within the GET request's query string. For example, `aggregate_type=nvt"-alert(document.domain)-"`.
*   The attacker needs to know a valid `token`. In cases where the guest mode is enabled, the `token=guest` can be used.
*   The attack is triggered when a user visits a page which triggers the vulnerable AJAX call, or if the attacker can trick a user to click a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter and induce a user of GSA to visit this URL.
*   The attacker needs to know a valid `token`, but if the guest mode is enabled, the attacker can use `token=guest`.
*   The attacker is not required to have direct access to the server but must have a way to send malicious requests through the browser of a logged in user.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability existed in Greenbone Security Assistant versions 6.0.0 and prior to 6.0.8.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Greenbone on January 7, 2016, and a fix was released for Greenbone Security Manager on January 9, 2016, and for OpenVAS on January 13, 2016.
*   The vendor response was quick and transparent.
*   The content also mentions a second minor bug where an arbitrary URL can be injected into the login link when a request like `GET //internetwache.org/? HTTP/1.1 Host: secinfo.greenbone.net` is made. This would cause the guest login link to redirect to the injected URL. This is not related to the CVE.
