Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-1690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap use-after-free in the Autofill component of the Chromium browser. This occurs due to a mishandling of the interaction between field updates and JavaScript code that triggers a frame deletion. When the JavaScript deletes the associated frame while there's still a method that changed the field value down the call stack, it results in a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap use-after-free
- Improper handling of asynchronous operations and object lifetimes in Autofill component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (crash) due to the use-after-free condition.
- Possibility of arbitrary code execution (unspecified).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted web page: An attacker can create a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerability when visited by the victim.
- Manipulation of autofill fields to trigger JavaScript execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and host a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to trick the user to visit this crafted page.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the Autofill component of the Chromium browser.
- The specific issue is due to the way the browser handles frame deletions in relation to field changes initiated by the Autofill functionality.
- The fix involves postponing deletion of the AutofillAgent and related classes by sending a DeleteSoon task upon frame destruction.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Chrome version 51.0.2704.63.
