# FIRMADYNE CVE-2016-1558 & CVE-2016-1559

16 март, 2016

**Overview**

ZERO - DAY: Researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Boston universities used an open-source framework to perform dynamic security analysis on embedded firmware.  Two issues affect D-Link:

ISSUES

1) Buffer overflow: The web server for D-Link Access Points has a buffer overflow vulnerability triggered while parsing the dlink \_uid cookie (CVE-2016-1558)

Impact: APs may be exposed to possibilities leading to abnormal operation such as the Web Manage page not allowing login. This means the user cannot adjust the settings of the device and other functions under the Web Manager. However, this does not lead to remote code execution and a hacker cannot take control of the device, gain passwords or any other illegal entry to the network through this vulnerability.

2) Password/ Username Exposure through SNMP: For 3 D-Link Access Points (DAP-1353 H/W ver. B1, DAP-2553 H/W ver. A1, DAP-3520 H/W ver. A1), the administrative username/password is exposed through SNMP OID strings. CVE-2016-1559.

Impact : The SNMP OID string text containing the password/username can only be accessed if the following 3 conditions are met: 1) SNMP protocol is enabled. 2) the device administrator is performing management tasks through SNMP. 3) The attacker sniffs out the correct packets to obtain the password/username. Please note that not all D-Link access points have the SNMP protocol enabled by default.

* <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Feb/112>

**General Recommendations**

Immediately update to the fixed firmware referenced in the table below as they are made available. Please continue to monitor this page for further updates and disclosures.

**Affected Product**

1) Firmware updates for the OVERFLOW issue are to be released before Mid April.

| --- | --- | --- |
| DAP-2230 | 1.02 or earlier | FW: 1.03 |
| DAP-2310 | 2.06 or earlier | FW: 2.07 |
| DAP-2330 | 1.06 or earlier | FW: 1.07 |
| DAP-2360 | 2.06 or earlier | FW: 2.07 |

| DAP-2660 | 1.11 or earlier | FW: 1.13 |
| DAP-2690 | 3.15 or earlier | FW: 3.16 |
| DAP-2695 | 1.16 or earlier | FW: 1.17 |
| DAP-3320 | 1.00 or earlier | FW: 1.01 Estimated availability 15/04/2016 |
| DAP-3662 | 1.01 or earlier | FW: 1.02 |

2) A temporary fix for SNMP issue is to disable the SNMP protocol through the device web configuration.

# D-Link, Netgear Router Vulnerabiltiies

---

*From*: Dominic Chen <ddchen () andrew cmu edu>

```
Hello,

We’d like to report several vulnerabilities in embedded devices developed by D-Link and Netgear, which were discovered
using our FIRMADYNE framework for emulation and dynamic analysis of Linux-based embedded devices. For more information,
refer to our academic paper and open-source release at <https://github.com/firmadyne/firmadyne>.

Several Netgear devices include unauthenticated webpages that pass form input directly to the command-line, allowing
for a command injection attack in `boardData102.php`, `boardData103.php`, `boardDataJP.php`, `boardDataNA.php`, and
`boardDataWW.php`. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1555. Affected devices include:

Netgear WN604
Netgear WN802Tv2
Netgear WNAP210
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

Several D-Link devices include a web server that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow while parsing the 'dlink_uid'
cookie. The length of the value set in the cookie is obtained using strlen(), which is then passed to memcpy(), and the
value is copied into a fixed-size buffer. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1558. Affected devices include:

D-Link DAP-2310
D-Link DAP-2330
D-Link DAP-2360
D-Link DAP-2553
D-Link DAP-2660
D-Link DAP-2690
D-Link DAP-2695

Several Netgear devices include unauthenticated webpages that disclose the wireless WPS PIN, allowing for information
disclosure. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1556. Affected devices include:

Netgear WN604
Netgear WNAP210
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WND930
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

Several devices by both D-Link and Netgear disclose wireless passwords and administrative usernames/passwords over
SNMP, including OID’s iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.2.1.3.3.2.1.1.4,
iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.35.4.1.1.1, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.37.4.1.1.1, iso.3.6.1.4.1.171.10.37.38.4.1.1.1,
iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.8.1.5, iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.5, iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.9.1.7, and
iso.3.6.1.4.1.4526.100.7.10.1.7. This has been assigned CVE-2016-1557 for Netgear devices, and CVE-2016-1559 for D-Link
devices. Affected devices include:

D-Link DAP-1353
D-Link DAP-2553
D-Link DAP-3520
Netgear WNAP320
Netgear WNDAP350
Netgear WNDAP360

We have not heard back from D-Link after contacting the vendor. Netgear will fix WN604 with firmware 3.3.3 by late
February, but the tentative ETA for the remaining devices is mid-March.

Thanks,

Dominic
