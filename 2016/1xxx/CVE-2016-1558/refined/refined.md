Based on the provided content, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2016-1558:

*   **Vulnerability:** Buffer overflow
*   **Root Cause:** The web server for D-Link Access Points has a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered while parsing the `dlink_uid` cookie. The length of the value set in the cookie is obtained using `strlen()`, which is then passed to `memcpy()`, and the value is copied into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with a `dlink_uid` cookie containing an overly long string.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to abnormal operation, such as the web management page not allowing login. The user cannot adjust the settings of the device and other functions under the Web Manager. According to D-Link, this does not lead to remote code execution, and a hacker cannot take control of the device, gain passwords, or gain illegal entry to the network.
