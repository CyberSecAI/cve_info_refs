Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-1095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader DC handles JPEG2000 files. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate the value of the `vsep` parameter of the last component in a JPEG2000 file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The improper validation of `vsep` can lead to an out-of-bounds read, allowing an attacker to access memory locations outside of the intended buffer.
- Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read allows the attacker to leak sensitive information from adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose the contents of adjacent memory, which may contain sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Files: The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted malicious JPEG2000 file.
- Malicious Web Pages: Visiting a web page containing a malicious JPEG2000 file can also trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted JPEG2000 file with a malicious value for `vsep`.
- The attacker must induce a user to either open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability requires user interaction for exploitation.
- Adobe has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID.
