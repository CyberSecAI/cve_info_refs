Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. CVE-2016-1014:**

*   **Root cause:**  The root cause is a DLL hijacking vulnerability within the executable installers and uninstallers of Adobe Flash Player prior to versions 22.0.0.192 and 18.0.0.360. These executables load and execute Windows system DLLs from their application directory, instead of the system directory. On older Windows versions, there is an attempt to load DLLs from the PATH which do not exist in those versions (e.g., PCACli.dll and API-MS-Win-Downlevel-Shell32-l1-1-0.dll on Windows 7 and earlier).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   **DLL Hijacking:**  The installers/uninstallers load DLLs from untrusted locations.
    *   **Untrusted Search Path:** The software searches for required DLLs in insecure and potentially attacker-controlled locations.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can place malicious DLLs in the same directory as the installer/uninstaller, causing these to be executed with administrative privileges, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Attack vectors:** A local attacker can place specially crafted DLL files (e.g., `PCACli.dll`, `API-MS-Win-Downlevel-Shell32-l1-1-0.dll`, `DWMAPI.dll` etc.)  in the same directory where the installer/uninstaller is executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to place the malicious DLLs. They also need to be able to trigger the execution of the vulnerable installer or uninstaller. The user needs to run the installer/uninstaller as an administrator.

**2. CVE-2016-1016:**

*   **Root cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the Transform object implementation of Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** A memory corruption vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player's Transform object.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted Flash file, likely with a `flash.geom.Matrix` callback, can be used to trigger the vulnerability. This file can be embedded on a web page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to host or inject the malicious Flash file, and convince a user to open it in their browser.

**3. CVE-2016-1012:**

*   **Root cause:**  Memory corruption vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** This CVE describes a memory corruption issue, the specifics are not detailed here.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows remote code execution or denial of service.
*  **Attack vectors:** Unspecified vectors, possibly a malformed flash file.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** User interaction required. The attacker needs to get the victim to load the malicious flash content, usually through the browser.

**4. CVE-2016-1015:**

*   **Root cause:** A type confusion vulnerability where a NetConnection object properties override leads to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Type confusion, allowing the override of the NetConnection object.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows execution of arbitrary code.
*  **Attack vectors:** A malformed Flash file that exploits the NetConnection object.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host or inject a malicious Flash file, and have a user open it.

**5. CVE-2016-1017:**

*   **Root cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability in the `LoadVars.decode` function of Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free in the `LoadVars.decode` function.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Allows execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation through a crafted Flash file utilizing `LoadVars.decode` function in some way.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have the user load the malicious SWF file, for example via a web browser.

**6. CVE-2016-1011:**

*   **Root cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability within Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free leading to potential code execution
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Allows arbitrary code execution
*   **Attack vectors:** Unspecified vectors in a flash file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host or inject the malicious Flash file, and have a user open it.

**7. CVE-2016-1013:**

*   **Root cause:**  Use-after-free vulnerability within Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free in the flash player.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution is possible.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Exploitable through unspecified methods in a malicious flash file.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious Flash file and get a user to load it.

**Summary:**

All of the mentioned CVEs related to Adobe Flash Player point to serious security vulnerabilities. Most involve remote code execution and are triggered by a user opening a malicious flash file via the web browser. CVE-2016-1014, however, is a local privilege escalation via DLL hijacking on the install/uninstall programs. Exploiting them leads to arbitrary code execution, thus these are considered critical flaws. Most of these vulnerabilities have a medium complexity score which requires user interaction but the attack vectors are typically easily deployed through web browsers.

It's also important to note that these vulnerabilities were addressed in a Flash Player update to version 11.2.202.616 (or newer) on Linux and 21.0.0.213 (or newer) on Windows and macOS.
