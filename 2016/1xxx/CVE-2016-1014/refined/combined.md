# [CVE-2016-1014] Escalation of privilege via executable (un)installers of Flash Player

---

*From*: "Stefan Kanthak" <stefan.kanthak () nexgo de>

Hi @ll,

the executable (un)installers for Flash Player before version
22.0.0.192 and 18.0.0.360 (both released on 2016-06-15) are
vulnerable to DLL hijacking: they load and execute multiple
Windows system DLLs from their "application directory" instead
of Windows' "system directory" %SystemRoot%\System32\.

On Windows 7 and before they also (try to) load PCACli.dll and
API-MS-Win-Downlevel-Shell32-l1-1-0.dll from the PATH:
PCACli.Dll and API-MS-Win-Downlevel-Shell32-l1-1-0.dll are not
present there, these DLLs were first shipped with Windows 8.

On Windows XP and before they additionally try to load DWMAPI.dll,
PropSys.dll, DevRtl.dll and RPCRTRemote.dll from the PATH: these
DLLs were first shipped with Windows Vista.

See <<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html>>,
<<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html>> and
<<https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html>> for details
about this well-known and well-documented beginner's error!

Due to the application manifest embedded in the executables which
specifies "requireAdministrator" the installers are run with
administrative privileges ("protected" administrators are prompted
for consent, unprivileged standard users are prompted for an
administrator password); execution of the DLLs therefore results
in an escalation of privilege!

Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. visit (and read) <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/sentinel.html>>,
   then download <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/download/SENTINEL.DLL>>
   and save it as PCACli.dll, API-MS-Win-Downlevel-Shell32-l1-1-0.dll,
   DWMAPI.dll, RPCRTRemote.dll, OLEAcc.dll, PSAPI.dll, SetupAPI.dll,
   ClbCatQ.dll, WSock32.dll, WS2_32.dll, HNetCfg.dll, DNSAPI.dll,
   IPHlpAPI.dll, RASAPI32.dll, SensAPI.dll, RASAdHlp.dll, RASMan.dll
   plus UserEnv.dll, COMRes.dll, WS2Help.dll, TAPI32.dll, RTUtils.dll
   SAMLib.dll and WinMM.dll in your "Downloads" directory;

2. fetch the (un)installers for Flash Player released before 2016-06-15
   from Adobe's web site and save them in your "Downloads" directory;

3. run the (un)installers downloaded in step 2 and notice the message
   boxes displayed from the DLLs placed in step 1.

PWNED!

JFTR: since the (un)installers are 32-bit programs and (un)install
      both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Flash Player this POC
      works on 64-bit Windows too.

stay tuned

Timeline:
~~~~~~~~~

2016-03-12    first vulnerability report sent to Adobe

2016-03-13    Adobe acknowledged the receipt

2016-04-06    Adobe informed about the upcoming patch to be released
              2016-04-07 and the assignment of CVE-2016-1014

2016-04-17    second vulnerability report sent to Adobe: the "fixed"
              (un)installers are still vulnerable, they just load
              some other DLLs now

2016-04-20    Adobe confirmed the second report and announced to fix
              the vulnerability in the June update

2016-06-15    Adobe released fixed (un)installers

2016-06-17    report published

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?**

In a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer for the desktop, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit any of these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

In a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer in the Windows 8-style UI, an attacker would first need to compromise a website already listed in the Compatibility View (CV) list. An attacker could then host a website that contains specially crafted Flash content designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email. For more information about Internet Explorer and the CV List, please see the MSDN Article, [Developer Guidance for websites with content for Adobe Flash Player in Windows 8](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/jj193557%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

## Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer for the desktop, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit any of these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit any of these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* Internet Explorer in the Windows 8-style UI will only play Flash content from sites listed on the Compatibility View (CV) list. This restriction requires an attacker to first compromise a website already listed on the CV list. An attacker could then host specially crafted Flash content designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Windows Live Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables scripts and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use any of these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248.aspx). This mode can help reduce the likelihood of the exploitation of these Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.

## Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update.

* **Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer and other applications that honor the kill bit feature, such as Office 2007 and Office 2010, by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  To set the kill bit for the control in the registry, perform the following steps:

  1. Paste the following into a text file and save it with the .reg file extension.

     ```
         Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
         [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
         "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

         [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
         "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     ```
  2. Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.
     You can also apply this workaround across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  **Impact of workaround**. There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Delete the registry keys that were added in implementing this workaround.

\*\* \*\*

* **Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Internet Explorer through Group Policy**

  **Note** The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit, or for an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  [Group Policy Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831791)

  [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc737816%28v%3Dws.10%29.aspx)

  [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc784165%28v%3Dws.10%29.aspx)

  To disable Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer through Group Policy, perform the following steps:

  **Note** This workaround does not prevent Flash from being invoked from other applications, such as Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2010.

  1. Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure the console to work with the appropriate Group Policy object, such as local machine, OU, or domain GPO.
  2. Navigate to the following node:
     **Administrative Templates** -> **Windows Components** -> **Internet Explorer** -> **Security Features** -> **Add-on Management**
  3. Double-click **Turn off Adobe Flash in Internet Explorer and prevent applications from using Internet Explorer technology to instantiate Flash objects**.
  4. Change the setting to **Enabled**.
  5. Click **Apply** and then click **OK** to return to the Group Policy Management Console.
  6. Refresh Group Policy on all systems or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.

\*\* \*\*

* **Prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Office 2010 on affected systems**

  **Note** This workaround does not prevent Adobe Flash Player from running in Internet Explorer.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179076.aspx). Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To disable Adobe Flash Player in Office 2010 only, set the kill bit for the ActiveX control for Adobe Flash Player in the registry using the following steps:

  1. Create a text file named Disable\_Flash.reg with the following contents:

     ```
         Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

         [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Common\COM\Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}]
         "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     ```
  2. Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.
  3. **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

     You can also apply this workaround across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

* **Prevent ActiveX controls from running in Office 2007 and Office 2010**

  To disable all ActiveX controls in Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010, including Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. Click **File**, click **Options**, click **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
  2. Click **ActiveX Settings** in the left-hand pane, and then select **Disable all controls without notifications**.
  3. Click **OK** to save your settings.

  **Impact of workaround.** Office documents that use embedded ActiveX controls may not display as intended.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable ActiveX controls in Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010, perform the following steps:

  1. Click **File**, click **Options**, click **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
  2. Click **ActiveX Settings** in the left-hand pane, and then deselect **Disable all controls without notifications**.
  3. Click **OK** to save your settings.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites on the Internet or an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  \*\* \*\*
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer, and then click **OK** again.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  \*\* \*\*
* **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two sites in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and they require an ActiveX control to install the update.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
