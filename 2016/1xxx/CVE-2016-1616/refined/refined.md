Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-1616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `CustomButton::AcceleratorPressed` function within the Chromium browser's UI framework. Specifically, the code allows URL spoofing when a custom button is not focused, meaning it handles accelerator key presses even when it shouldn't.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Spoofing:** The core weakness is the ability to manipulate the browser's UI to display a different URL than what is actually being accessed, leading to potential phishing and other malicious activities.
- **Improper input validation:** The `CustomButton::AcceleratorPressed` function does not check if the button has focus before processing accelerator key presses.
- **Missing Access Controls**: The code handles accelerators without ensuring the associated button is actually the intended target and active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **URL Spoofing:** An attacker can trick users into believing they are on a legitimate website when they are actually on a malicious site. This can lead to the theft of credentials, financial information, or other sensitive data.
- **Phishing Attacks:** The vulnerability can be used to create highly convincing phishing attacks that are difficult to detect because the browser's UI shows a legitimate URL.
- **Social Engineering Attacks:** With the help of URL Spoofing an attacker could easily launch other forms of social engineering attacks, where the target is tricked to perform an action which might be detrimental to them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Pages:** A malicious website could be created that includes a specially crafted custom button.
- **User Interaction:** An unsuspecting user may press an accelerator key that triggers an action when the focus is not on the button.
- **Unfocused Button:** The attack requires a custom button that does not have the browser's focus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote, delivering the malicious content through a website.
- **Limited User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to press an accelerator key while the malicious web page is active.
- **Crafted HTML:** The attacker must create malicious HTML code that leverages the vulnerable `CustomButton` component.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is addressed in Chromium version 48.0.2564.82.
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure that custom buttons only handle accelerators when the button is focused and the widget is active.
- The vulnerability was reported by Luan Herrera.
- Patches for this vulnerability were made to `ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc`, `ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.h` and `ui/views/controls/button/custom_button_unittest.cc`

This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially perform phishing attacks and deceive users into interacting with malicious content due to the ability to alter how URLs are displayed.
