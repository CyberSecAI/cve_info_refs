## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/01/stable-channel-update_20.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, January 20, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 48 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 48.0.2564.82 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/47.0.2526.111..48.0.2564.82?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 48.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [37 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M48&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[579625](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=579625)] CVE-2016-1620: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.8 branch (currently 4.8.271.17).

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer) or [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity).

I think Scott is wondering how the underlying production code tries to have an accelerator be handled within an inactive widget. As for the failing test, perhaps make the default activation true, or only use TestWidget in your specific test fixture. ```     | **meacer** | | On 2015/11/12 00:45:44, msw wrote: > On 2015/11/12 00:37:32, Mustafa Emre Acer wrote: > > ... | | --- | | 5 years, 1 month ago (2015-11-12 21:11:40 UTC) [#11](#msg11) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2015/11/12 00:45:44, msw wrote: > On 2015/11/12 00:37:32, Mustafa Emre Acer wrote: > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/butto...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc) > > File ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc (right): > >  > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/butto...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc#newcode254) > > ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc:254: if (GetWidget() && > > !GetWidget()->IsActive()) > > On 2015/11/11 18:54:01, sky wrote: > > > Actually, how is the button getting the accelerator if the widget isn't > > active? > >  > > One of the failing tests has this scenario: > > ConstrainedWindowViewTest::ClosesOnEscape tries to close the dialog, but the > > widget is not active when the keypress is sent. > >  > > Not sure if this is desired behavior.

Thanks for pointing this out. Looks like this fix isn't correct because the newly created login window isn't set as active in the first place. That means this fix breaks handling of all accelerators (e.g. ESC doesn't close the dialog anymore), since IsActive() for the dialog is always false.  Not being very familiar with the UI code, I don't know if we expect the newly created window to be activated too. I dug into focusing and activating code a bit, and it looks like only top level windows can be activated, which the newly created modal login dialog is not. Should it be activated?  As for accelerator handling, CustomButton defers CanHandleAccelerators to View which doesn't check for activity status. That seems to be low level code which I assume works correctly, or should it check for the widget being active? ```     | **msw** | | On 2015/11/12 21:11:40, Mustafa Emre Acer wrote: > On 2015/11/12 00:45:44, msw wrote: > > ... | | --- | | 5 years, 1 month ago (2015-11-12 21:20:09 UTC) [#12](#msg12) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2015/11/12 21:11:40, Mustafa Emre Acer wrote: > On 2015/11/12 00:45:44, msw wrote: > > On 2015/11/12 00:37:32, Mustafa Emre Acer wrote: > > > > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/butto...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc) > > > File ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc (right): > > >  > > > > > > [https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/butto...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1437523005/diff/40001/ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc#newcode254) > > > ui/views/controls/button/custom_button.cc:254: if (GetWidget() && > > > !GetWidget()->IsActive()) > > > On 2015/11/11 18:54:01, sky wrote: > > > > Actually, how is the button getting the accelerator if the widget isn't > > > active? > > >  > > > One of the failing tests has this scenario: > > > ConstrainedWindowViewTest::ClosesOnEscape tries to close the dialog, but the > > > widget is not active when the keypress is sent. > > >  > > > Not sure if this is desired behavior.

Scott may have a better suggestion and would know if there's something more fundamentally wrong with the state of affairs. My naive suggestion is to test if focus is on a descendant of the button's widget, but that seems like a hacky workaround. It'd be nice to also test if the top-level window of the button (ie. the dialog's parent?) is active, but I'm not sure that's entirely feasible... I'll ask Scott to weigh in. ```     | **sky** | | I was thinking we should block this at the accelerator dispatching level.

That's because it's a child widget, which are never 'active'. I think you'll need to check the top level widget too, eg:  I think you want something like  if ((InChildWidget() && !FocusInChildWidget()) || (!InChildWidget() && !GetWidget()->IsActive())   return;  InChildWidget is GetWidget() && GetWidget()->GetTopLevelWidget() != GetWidget() for FocusInChildWidget you have to go to focusmanager and see if the focused view is contained in the rootview of the widget.  Or make active status work correctly. The problem is from the systems perspective the top level widget is the active one, and making that inactive likely has problems. ```     | **meacer** | | On 2015/11/13 01:07:45, sky wrote: > On 2015/11/12 23:51:47, Mustafa Emre Acer wrote: > > ... | | --- | | 5 years, 1 month ago (2015-11-16 21:07:36 UTC) [#16](#msg16) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2015/11/13 01:07:45, sky wrote: > On 2015/11/12 23:51:47, Mustafa Emre Acer wrote: > > On 2015/11/12 23:42:57, sky wrote: > > > I was thinking we should block this at the accelerator dispatching level.

# CVE-2016-1617

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1616.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1618.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1617 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1617)

#### Description

The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.82, does not apply http policies to https URLs and does not apply ws policies to wss URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report.
