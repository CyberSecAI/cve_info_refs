Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-1968:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Integer underflow in the Brotli decompression library. This occurs when a pointer calculation results in a low memory address due to an inadequate size check, leading to out-of-bounds writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow due to the integer underflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of service (application crash).
*   Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted website or other content using Brotli compression.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious payload using Brotli compression to a vulnerable application (e.g. Firefox).
*   User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability when accessing the crafted content.

**Technical Details**
*   The vulnerability was introduced in commit `94cd7085f79a707f5ba3d93086796e695b495975` of the brotli library and was fixed in commit `33aa40220b96cf95ad2b9ba61dc8d7fd2f964f2c`.
*   The vulnerable version of the brotli library was present in Firefox trunk and possibly other versions.
*   The provided reproduction steps involve cloning the brotli library, checking out the vulnerable commit, compiling the `bro` tool, and then decompressing a `crash.compressed` file to trigger the overflow. The use of setarch is to reliably trigger the overflow by disabling ASLR and giving low address values.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability was reported to both Google and Mozilla, and the fixes were cherry-picked into Chrome 48, 49, and Chromium.
*   Mozilla awarded a bounty for the report of the vulnerability and the provided test case.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "sec-high".
*   The fix for the vulnerability was included in the update to Firefox 45.
*   The issue was also addressed in SUSE products, with the fix incorporated into their respective packages of firefox and associated components.
