Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-20012:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The content from `security.netapp.com`, `github.com` and `openwall.com` directly mentions CVE-2016-20012. The description in the NetApp advisory and GitHub advisory database entries matches the official description of CVE-2016-20012. Therefore, this content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the OpenSSH server's behavior of sending a challenge to the client *only if* a provided username and public key combination could be valid for a login session. This behavior allows remote attackers to test the validity of username and public key pairs. The core issue is that the server reveals information about potential valid user/key pairs through its response behavior in the authentication process.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **User Enumeration Oracle:** The primary weakness is that the SSH server acts as an oracle, providing information on the existence of valid user/public key combinations. This is considered a partial disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
*   **Information Leakage:** The server's behavior of sending a challenge response only for valid user/key pairs results in an information leak that can be exploited.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to discover valid usernames on the target system associated with a specific public key. This can be used to narrow attack vectors.
*   The NetApp advisory states that "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information."
*  Although the NetApp advisory gives a score of 0.0, the github advisory gives a 5.3 score because it allows an attacker to determine valid usernames on a server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by attackers over the network, specifically using the SSH protocol. An attacker can send an unauthenticated SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST with a public key to the target server to determine if it is a valid user/public key combination.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to initiate an SSH connection to the target server.
*   **Knowledge/Suspicion:** The attacker needs to have a suspicion about the combination of a username and public key that might be valid on the SSH server. The attacker needs to know or guess usernames and have access to a set of public keys (e.g. scraped from Github).
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need prior credentials to perform the enumeration check.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "disputed" by NetApp, as they do not consider user enumeration a vulnerability for their product.
*   The OpenSSH team also does not plan to change this behavior, as they believe the benefit of avoiding unnecessary private key unwrapping outweighs the risk of this information leak. However, they have implemented an option to disable this behavior.
*   The IETF RFC document (RFC 4252) specifies the publickey method and states that it's optional to verify the public key before sending the signature, which is the source of the vulnerability.
* The NetApp advisory notes that no NetApp products are affected.
* The Github advisory notes that the vulnerability is present in OpenSSH versions through 8.7.
