Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-20009:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ipdnsc_decode_name()` function of the DNS client within Wind River VxWorks operating system. This function is responsible for decoding DNS names, and a failure to properly bound decompression of names leads to the overflow.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `ipdnsc_decode_name()` function, which does not properly validate the size of a decompressed DNS name before writing it to a stack buffer.
- Specifically, when DNS name compression is used, the function iterates through compressed labels, calculating the total length of the decompressed name. This total length is not checked against a maximum buffer size before writing the decompressed data into the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the stack-based buffer overflow, which occurs when the decompressed DNS name exceeds the size of the allocated stack buffer (255 bytes).
- **Insufficient Size Check:** The code fails to check if the total length (`tot_len`) of the decompressed name exceeds `IPDNSC_MAXNAME` during decompression and before writing to the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address and other important data on the stack. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable process.
- **Denial of Service:** The overflow could also crash the affected service or system.
- The Siemens advisory also highlights the potential for remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who can control or intercept DNS responses to a vulnerable VxWorks device.
- **DNS Response Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious DNS response with a name record that decompresses to a size larger than the target buffer. This can be achieved by:
    - **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** Intercepting DNS traffic and modifying the responses.
    - **Compromised DNS Servers:** Controlling a DNS server to serve malicious responses.
    - **Local Network:** Simply being present on the same network and providing a malicious DNS response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to send or manipulate DNS responses to the vulnerable device. This may require:
    - Being on the same network as the target device.
    - Controlling a DNS server that the target device uses.
    - Intercepting the DNS traffic between the device and its DNS server.
    - Ability to craft a malicious DNS response.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of VxWorks (6.5 through 7).
- The Siemens advisory indicates the vulnerability affects gas turbines using Allen Bradley control systems.
- The vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities known as "Name:Wreck".
-  The vulnerability is officially listed as UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED, meaning the affected products are no longer supported by the maintainer.
