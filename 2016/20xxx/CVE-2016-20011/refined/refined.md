Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-20011:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the deprecated `SoupSessionSync` and `SoupSessionAsync` classes in `libgrss`. These classes, by default, do not perform TLS certificate verification. The code did not explicitly enable certificate verification by setting the `ssl-ca-file`, `tls-database`, or `ssl-strict` properties.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of TLS certificate verification: The application fails to validate the authenticity of the server's TLS certificate, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker could intercept and modify network traffic between the application and a server, potentially leading to data breaches, malware injection, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: An attacker needs to be positioned within the network path of the vulnerable application to perform a MITM attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: An attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the application and its server. This could be achieved through various means, such as by controlling a network router or via ARP poisoning.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported in 2016 but remained unfixed until a patch was created in 2021 after being migrated to Gitlab.
- The fix involves setting the "ssl-use-system-ca-file" property to TRUE on all `SoupSession` objects, ensuring that TLS certificate validation is performed.
- The vulnerable code uses `SoupSessionSync` in `src/feed-enclosure.c` and `SoupSessionAsync` in `src/feed-channel.c`, `src/feeds-pool.c`, `src/feeds-publisher.c`, and `src/feeds-subscriber.c`
