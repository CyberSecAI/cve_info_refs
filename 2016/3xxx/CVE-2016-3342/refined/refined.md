- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver improperly handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory handling in the CLFS driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability could run processes in an elevated context, potentially taking complete control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to execute code.
