  "CVE-2016-3982": {
    "description": "Off-by-one error in the bmp_rle4_fread function in pngxrbmp.c in OptiPNG before 0.7.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write access and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "An off-by-one error in the `bmp_rle4_fread` function within `pngxrbmp.c` leads to an out-of-bounds read or write due to incorrect handling of memory while processing RLE4-encoded BMP images.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Off-by-one error"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by processing a specially crafted BMP image.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when OptiPNG processes a malformed BMP image.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious BMP file to the vulnerable application.",
      "required_position": "The attacker can be remote."
