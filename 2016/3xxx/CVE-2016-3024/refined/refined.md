Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IBM Security Access Manager appliances allowing web pages, which may contain sensitive information, to be cached by the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure caching of web pages: The appliances do not prevent browsers from caching web pages, potentially including sensitive data. This means that even after a user logs out or closes the browser, copies of the pages may remain on the user's hard drive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: An attacker with local access to the user's machine or malware installed on the user's computer could access the cached web pages and potentially view sensitive information. This could lead to unauthorized access to data, credentials, or other confidential details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker who has physical access to the user's computer can directly access the cached files from the browser's cache.
- Malware: Malware installed on the user's computer can be used to extract data from the browser cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the user's machine. This could mean physical access or remote access via malware installed on the user's system.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or to bypass any authentication mechanisms on the application itself. The vulnerability lies in how the browser is caching the pages and not the application itself.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Security Access Manager for Web and Mobile 8.0 appliances and IBM Security Access Manager 9.0 appliances, all firmware versions.
- Patches are available to resolve this issue.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations available other than patching.
