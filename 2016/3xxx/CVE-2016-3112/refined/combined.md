Create consumer private keys with 600 permissions ([CVE-2016-3112](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3j4c-jhfg-648f "CVE-2016-3112"))

```
Prior to this commit, consumers wrote the certificate and private key
issued by the Pulp server's registration process to
/etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem with 644 permissions, which
allowed anyone on the host to read the private key. This ensures the
file is written with 600 permissions.

## Topic

Red Hat Satellite 6.2 now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7

## Description

Red Hat Satellite is a systems management tool for Linux-based
infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, remote management and
monitoring of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.
It performs provisioning and configuration management of predefined
standard operating environments.

This update provides Satellite 6.2 packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 Satellite server. For the full list of new features provided by Satellite 6.2 see the Release Notes linked to in the references section. Please see the Satellite 6 Installation Guide for detailed instructions on how to install or upgrade from prior versions of Satellite 6.

All users who require Satellite version 6.2 are advised to install these new packages.

Changes to the Capsule component:

* Kerberos issues with IPA Realm integration would cause provisioning to fail in Satellite 6.1. This has been resolved in Satellite 6.2, and provisioning will work with this setup. (BZ#1305402)

Changes to the Compute Resources component:

* Satellite 6.2 features performance fixes, including provisioning to clusters if they are contained in a nested folder. (BZ#1314090)

Changes to the Content Management component:

* This release introduces the ability to provision Red Hat Atomic Host in addition to standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This includes syncing down Atomic Content, promoting that content through a lifecycle environment, and provisioning Atomic Hosts. (BZ#1315043)
* With this release, users of Red Hat Satellite 6.2 can sync down repositories protected by basic authentication by providing the username and password in the repository string. (BZ#1174948)
* Elastic Search has been removed from Red Hat Satellite. It has been replaced by the standard searching provided by the database. (BZ#1259374)
* With this release, the content dashboard in Red Hat Satellite 6.1 has now been combined into the main dashboard, providing a single point of summary information for the user. (BZ#1146874)

Changes to the Content Views component:

* Satellite 6.2 provides improvements to Bulk Actions and Host Collections. Changing the content view in the web UI now works as intended. (BZ#1315280)
* With this release, content view versions in Red Hat Satellite 6.2 have been improved to show the version of the puppet module that is included. (BZ#1241975)

Changes to the Disconnected component:

* This release introduces the ability to export content from one Satellite Server and import it into another server. The content can come from the Library, or can be from a content view. This feature can be used to support populating an air-gapped server with content from another server. (BZ#1127456)

Changes to the Pulp component:

* Satellite 6.2 provides substantial improvements to content synchronization. These improvements include improved messages in cases where content synchronization is considered successful, even though one or more packages failed to download. (BZ#1292953)

Changes to the Remote Execution component:

* This release adds a Remote Execution feature that allows users to execute commands against machines under inventory. The commands can be stored as jobs, and can be scheduled to run in the future or on a recurring basis. (BZ#1131296)

Changes to the Subscription Management component:

* With this release, the virt-who agent can now be installed on the same machine where the main Satellite Server is hosted. (BZ#1209467)

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied and that the Satellite is updated to the most recent 6.1.x release.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

Subject: [PATCH] Create consumer private keys with 600 permissions
(CVE-2016-3112)
Prior to this commit, consumers wrote the certificate and private key
issued by the Pulp server's registration process to
/etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem with 644 permissions, which
allowed anyone on the host to read the private key. This ensures the
file is written with 600 permissions.

**Description**

During installation, the RSA key pairs used to validate messages between the pulp server and pulp consumers are generated in a directory that is world-readable with a umask of 002. After it was written, the permissions are modified to protect the key. For a brief moment, the RSA keys are world-readable. An attacker who has access to the host installing Pulp could theoretically open the file after it is created, but before its permissions are set, and read the private key.

pulp.spec now generate RSA keys with umask 077 (CVE-2016-3111)

During installation, the RSA key pairs used to validate messages between
the pulp server and pulp consumers were generated in a directory that is
world-readable with a umask of 002. After it was written, the permissions
were modified to protect the key. For a brief moment, the RSA keys were
world-readable. This commit explicitly sets the umask in the %post
scriptlet to be 077 so it is only readable to the owner.

Prior to this commit, consumers wrote the certificate and private key
issued by the Pulp server's registration process to
/etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem with 644 permissions, which
allowed anyone on the host to read the private key. This ensures the
file is written with 600 permissions.

**Description**

Pulp consumers write the certificate and private key issued by the Pulp server's registration process to /etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem with 644 permissions, which allowed anyone on the host to read the private key.

This means a non-privileged user on the host could authenticate with the Pulp server as the consumer.

### CVE-2016-3112: Pulp consumer private keys are world-readable

**Description**

Pulp consumers write the certificate and private key issued by the Pulp server's registration process to /etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem with 644 permissions, which allowed anyone on the host to read the private key.

This means a non-privileged user on the host could authenticate with the Pulp server as the consumer.

Create consumer private keys with 600 permissions (CVE-2016-3112)

Prior to this commit, consumers wrote the certificate and private key
issued by the Pulp server's registration process to
/etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem with 644 permissions, which
allowed anyone on the host to read the private key. This ensures the
file is written with 600 permissions.
