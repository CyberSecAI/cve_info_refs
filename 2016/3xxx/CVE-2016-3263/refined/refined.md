Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3263:

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-3263 is an information disclosure vulnerability within the Windows GDI+ component. It is triggered by the improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI). While this vulnerability itself does not lead to arbitrary code execution, it can allow an attacker to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). This makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities, especially remote code execution vulnerabilities, by allowing the attacker to predict memory locations.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information Disclosure, Circumvention of ASLR.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The primary impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure, which can be used to bypass ASLR.
    *   By itself, this does not allow arbitrary code execution but makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities to achieve that, like remote code execution vulnerabilities that could lead to taking full control of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker would need to log on to an affected system and execute a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
    *   An attacker needs to run a specially crafted application locally.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
*   This vulnerability is often paired with a remote code execution vulnerability (such as CVE-2016-3393, CVE-2016-3396 which were released at the same time), to achieve full control of the system.
*   The provided document also includes details of other vulnerabilities patched in the same update:  CVE-2016-3209, CVE-2016-3262, CVE-2016-3270, CVE-2016-3393, CVE-2016-3396, and CVE-2016-7182, all of which relate to graphic components.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its impact, and how an attacker might leverage it.
