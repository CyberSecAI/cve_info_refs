Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3351:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how certain functions in Microsoft browsers (Internet Explorer and Edge) handle objects in memory when processing a file's mime type. Specifically, the `mimeType` property of an HTML anchor element could be used to determine the associated application by inspecting the registry.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to detect specific files present on the user's computer by querying the browser for the mime type of a file based on its extension. This information can be used to fingerprint the user's system, determine if specific software is installed (like Fiddler) and tailor malware attacks.
- **Abuse of Browser Feature**: The `mimeType` property on anchor elements was intended for determining how to handle a linked resource but was abused for fingerprinting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Fingerprinting:** Attackers can identify installed applications on the victim's machine.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Malware authors can tailor their attacks based on the presence or absence of certain software, specifically avoiding analysts or security researchers who have such debugging tools installed and thus prolonging the time malware goes undetected.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised/malicious websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content/advertisements.
- **Social Engineering**: Attackers would need to convince a user to visit the malicious website

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host or inject content into a website.
- Ability to convince users to visit the malicious web page.
- No special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
The provided content describes how the vulnerability was discovered and how it works in the unpatched state. The exploit uses the following javascript code snippet:

```javascript
anchor = document.createElement("A");
anchor.href = ".saz";
alert(anchor.mimeType);
// returns Fiddler Session Archive
```

This code creates an anchor element and sets its href to a file with a known extension (.saz in the example, which represents a Fiddler Session Archive). By accessing the `mimeType` property, the browser returns the associated description from the registry if the associated software is installed.

The blog post also explains how the vulnerability was patched by removing the association of the `mimeType` property with file extensions and also provides a variation to this exploit, using `document.mimeType` and `image.mimeType` properties:

```javascript
img = new Image();
img.src = "saz.saz"; // HTTP 200, any length and content-type

// The saz is precached. Let's create the iframe.
iframe = document.createElement("iframe");

// Load anything inside it because about:blank does not work with replaceState.
iframe.src = "/favicon.ico";
document.body.appendChild(iframe);

// Set the location of the iframe to the saz file
iframe.contentWindow.history.replaceState("", "", img.src);

// Bingo!
alert(iframe.contentDocument.mimeType);
```

The blog post details the process used to identify the vulnerable code in the browser by decompiling mshtml.dll.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
- The provided content offers a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the patching process, exceeding the typical CVE description.
- The vulnerability was patched in both Internet Explorer and Edge.
- The content also provides a "before and after" patching analysis, showing how the vulnerable code was removed from the patched `mshtml.dll` file.
- A variation of the exploit, using document and image objects, was also described.
