RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1330969#c3)  Laszlo Ersek    2016-05-11 12:27:46 UTC  ``` Note for QE:  In his downstream v1 review, Michael recommended that I backport upstream 53db092ad1c8 as well.  I just did; that change however implies a small change to the test steps I wrote up in [bug 1248758 comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1248758#c42 "CLOSED ERRATA - match the OEM ID and OEM Table ID fields of the FADT and the RSDT to those of the SLIC") (and this difference is specific to the RHEL-7.3 qemu-kvm backport): for the DSDT table, most of the fields (OEM ID, OEM Table ID, ASL Compiler fields etc) will change with this bugfix *unconditionally* (regardless of the presence of a SLIC table). Namely:  -ACPI: DSDT ... 01137 (v01   BXPC   BXDSDT 00000001 INTL 20150619) +ACPI: DSDT ... 01137 (v01 BOCHS  BXPCDSDT 00000001 BXPC 00000001)  So this modifies points (7) and (8), when [bug 1248758 comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1248758#c42 "CLOSED ERRATA - match the OEM ID and OEM Table ID fields of the FADT and the RSDT to those of the SLIC") is applied for testing the RHEL-7.3 qemu-kvm backport. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1330969#c5)  Miroslav Rezanina    2016-05-16 08:06:55 UTC  ``` Fix included in qemu-kvm-1.5.3-112.el7   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1330969#c7)  Laszlo Ersek    2016-06-18 15:43:59 UTC  ``` Note for QE: when verifying this BZ, no regression testing is necessary beyond what I have already written up in [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1330969#c3) here, and in [bug 1248758 comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1248758#c42 "CLOSED ERRATA - match the OEM ID and OEM Table ID fields of the FADT and the RSDT to those of the SLIC"). (That item already contains regression tests.) Thanks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1330969#c8)  Guo, Zhiyi    2016-09-12 07:00:27 UTC  ``` Reproduce against qemu-kvm-1.5.3-111.el7.x86_64 and verified against qemu-kvm-1.5.3-122.el7.x86_64.

## Details

Zuozhi Fzz discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB OHCI emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2391](/security/CVE-2016-2391))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB Net emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2392](/security/CVE-2016-2392))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB Net emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak

host memory bytes. ([CVE-2016-2538](/security/CVE-2016-2538))

Hongke Yang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NE2000 emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2841](/security/CVE-2016-2841))

Ling Liu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled IP checksum routines. An

attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak host memory bytes.

([CVE-2016-2857](/security/CVE-2016-2857))

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04

LTS, Ubuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-2858](/security/CVE-2016-2858))

Wei Xiao and Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled access

in the VGA module. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this

issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU

is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor

profile. ([CVE-2016-3710](/security/CVE-2016-3710))

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1340971#c0)  Andrew Beekhof    2016-05-31 02:59:04 UTC  ``` Can we get this fixed in RHEL too please? Managing to reliably hit it just by calling:      strstr("pacemaker-1.0.rng", ".rng")  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1270703](show_bug.cgi?id=1270703 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - qemu: accel=tcg does not implement SSE 4 properly") +++  Description of problem:  An old SSE4 strstr from glibc returns incorrect results if running with qemu in accel=tcg mode.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  qemu-kvm-2.3.1-3.fc22.x86_64  How reproducible:  Always.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Compile the attached self-contained reproducer. 2. Run it with ./tst-strstr  Actual results:  Output looks like this:  error: needle not found at offset 3 (0x4007a3) error: needle not found at offset 4 (0x4007a4) error: needle not found at offset 5 (0x4007a5) …  Expected results:  No output.  Additional info:  Test case was extracted from glibc 2.17.  Current Fedora no longer has this strstr implementation, but you can test with CentOS 7 in a guest as well.  qemu-kvm command line:  /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -machine accel=kvm -name rhel7.0 -S -machine pc-i440fx-2.3,accel=tcg,usb=off -cpu SandyBridge -m 2048 -realtime mlock=off -smp 2,sockets=2,cores=1,threads=1 -uuid b885eb90-c211-4554-bb3e-9406008d8cb5 -no-user-config -nodefaults -chardev socket,id=charmonitor,path=/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/rhel7.0.monitor,server,nowait -mon chardev=charmonitor,id=monitor,mode=control -rtc base=utc,driftfix=slew -global kvm-pit.lost_tick_policy=discard -no-hpet -no-shutdown -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s3=1 -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s4=1 -boot strict=on -device ich9-usb-ehci1,id=usb,bus=pci.0,addr=0x6.0x7 -device ich9-usb-uhci1,masterbus=usb.0,firstport=0,bus=pci.0,multifunction=on,addr=0x6 -device ich9-usb-uhci2,masterbus=usb.0,firstport=2,bus=pci.0,addr=0x6.0x1 -device ich9-usb-uhci3,masterbus=usb.0,firstport=4,bus=pci.0,addr=0x6.0x2 -device virtio-serial-pci,id=virtio-serial0,bus=pci.0,addr=0x5 -drive file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel7.0.qcow2,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk0,format=qcow2 -device virtio-blk-pci,scsi=off,bus=pci.0,addr=0x7,drive=drive-virtio-disk0,id=virtio-disk0,bootindex=1 -netdev tap,fd=23,id=hostnet0 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=hostnet0,id=net0,mac=52:54:00:05:91:43,bus=pci.0,addr=0x3 -chardev pty,id=charserial0 -device isa-serial,chardev=charserial0,id=serial0 -chardev socket,id=charchannel0,path=/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channel/target/rhel7.0.org.qemu.guest_agent.0,server,nowait -device virtserialport,bus=virtio-serial0.0,nr=1,chardev=charchannel0,id=channel0,name=org.qemu.guest_agent.0 -chardev spicevmc,id=charchannel1,name=vdagent -device virtserialport,bus=virtio-serial0.0,nr=2,chardev=charchannel1,id=channel1,name=com.redhat.spice.0 -device usb-tablet,id=input0 -spice port=5900,addr=127.0.0.1,disable-ticketing,image-compression=off,seamless-migration=on -device qxl-vga,id=video0,ram_size=67108864,vram_size=67108864,vgamem_mb=16,bus=pci.0,addr=0x2 -device intel-hda,id=sound0,bus=pci.0,addr=0x4 -device hda-duplex,id=sound0-codec0,bus=sound0.0,cad=0 -chardev spicevmc,id=charredir0,name=usbredir -device usb-redir,chardev=charredir0,id=redir0 -chardev spicevmc,id=charredir1,name=usbredir -device usb-redir,chardev=charredir1,id=redir1 -device virtio-balloon-pci,id=balloon0,bus=pci.0,addr=0x8 -msg timestamp=on  --- Additional comment from Florian Weimer on 2015-10-12 04:16 EDT ---  compiled x86_64 program  --- Additional comment from Paolo Bonzini on 2015-10-12 05:11:16 EDT ---  Can you attach a statically linked binary?  --- Additional comment from Paolo Bonzini on 2015-10-12 05:24:51 EDT ---  Nevermind, I can reproduce it with the attached binary.  --- Additional comment from Florian Weimer on 2015-10-12 09:00:10 EDT ---  Paolo posted a fix upstream: <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-10/msg02605.html>  --- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2015-12-07 16:30:10 EST ---  qemu-2.3.1-8.fc22 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 22. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-686f289aa5>  --- Additional comment from Fedora Update System on 2015-12-08 18:51:22 EST ---  qemu-2.3.1-8.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 testing repository.

BR/ Guo, Zhiyi   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1340971#c12)  Paolo Bonzini    2016-09-13 19:07:22 UTC  ``` Can you put the qcow2 image somewhere for me to download?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1340971#c14)  Paolo Bonzini    2016-09-15 17:26:02 UTC  ``` Hi Zhiyi,  I couldn't find the root cause but you can work around the failure by disabling the NIC ("-net none" and no "-netdev" or "-device virtio-net-pci"). Also, please add "-cpu SandyBridge" to ensure that your guest uses SSE4.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Your configuration looks fine.  The bug is triggered when the NIC receive buffers are exhausted.  This is most likely to happen when the FTP server runs on the host.  If you used an FTP server on another machine then the chance of exhausting rtl8139 receive buffers is lower.  Was your FTP server running on the host?

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw and an out-of-bounds read flaw were found in the way QEMU's VGA emulator set certain VGA registers while in VBE mode. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-3712)

Red Hat would like to thank Zuozhi Fzz (Alibaba Inc.) for reporting this issue.

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Technical Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

      Xen Security Advisory CVE-2016-3710,CVE-2016-3712 / XSA-179
                               version 5

 QEMU: Banked access to VGA memory (VBE) uses inconsistent bounds checks

UPDATES IN VERSION 5
====================

Fixed credits section. Zuozhi Fzz was mistakenly credited with
CVE-2016-3710, but should have been credited with CVE-2016-3712.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Qemu VGA module allows banked access to video memory using the window
at 0xa00000 and it supports different access modes with different
address calculations.  But an attacker can easily change access modes
after setting the bank register.  This is CVE-2016-3710.

Qemu VGA module allows guest to edit certain registers in 'vbe' and
'vga' modes. ie. guest could set certain 'VGA' registers while in
'VBE' mode.  This is CVE-2016-3712.

IMPACT
======

A privileged guest user could use CVE-2016-3710 to exceed the bank
address window and write beyond the said memory area, potentially
leading to arbitrary code execution with privileges of the Qemu
process.  If the system is not using stubdomains, this will be in
domain 0.

A privileged guest user could use CVE-2016-3712 to cause potential
integer overflow or OOB read access issues in Qemu, resulting in a DoS
of the guest itself.  More dangerous effect, such as data leakage or
code execution, are not known but cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Versions of qemu shipped with all Xen versions are vulnerable.

Xen systems running on x86 with HVM guests, with the qemu process
running in dom0 are vulnerable.

Only guests provided with the "stdvga" emulated video card can exploit
the vulnerability.  The default "cirrus" emulated video card is not
vulnerable.  (With xl the emulated video card is controlled by the
"stdvga=" and "vga=" domain configuration options.)

ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Systems using only PV guests are not
vulnerable.

For VMs whose qemu process is running in a stub domain, a successful
attacker will only gain the privileges of that stubdom, which should
be only over the guest itself.

Both upstream-based versions of qemu (device_model_version="qemu-xen")
and `traditional' qemu (device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional")
are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid the issue.

Running HVM guests with the device model in a stubdomain will mitigate
the issue.

Changing the video card emulation to cirrus (stdvga=0, vga="cirrus",
in the xl domain configuraton) will avoid the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

CVE-2016-3710 was discovered and reported by "Wei Xiao and Qinghao
Tang of 360 Marvel Team" of 360.cn Inc.

CVE-2016-3712 was discovered and reported by Zuozhi Fzz of Alibaba
Inc.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue for
systems using upstream-based versions of qemu.  Patch 0001 addresses
CVE-2016-3710, and patches 0002-0005 address CVE-2016-3712.

## [Qemu-devel] [PULL 5/5] vga: make sure vga register setup for vbe stays

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PULL 5/5] vga: make sure vga register setup for vbe stays intact (CVE-2016-3712). |
| **Date**: | Mon, 9 May 2016 14:51:50 +0200 |

```
Call vbe_update_vgaregs() when the guest touches GFX, SEQ or CRT
registers, to make sure the vga registers will always have the
values needed by vbe mode.  This makes sure the sanity checks
applied by vbe_fixup_regs() are effective.

Without this guests can muck with shift_control, can turn on planar
vga modes or text mode emulation while VBE is active, making qemu
take code paths meant for CGA compatibility, but with the very
large display widths and heigts settable using VBE registers.

Which is good for one or another buffer overflow.  Not that
critical as they typically read overflows happening somewhere
in the display code.  So guests can DoS by crashing qemu with a
segfault, but it is probably not possible to break out of the VM.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit).

From the upstream patch:  """ From: Gerd Hoffmann <kraxel> Subject: [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] vga: add sr_vbe register set  Commit "fd3c136 vga: make sure vga register setup for vbe stays intact ([CVE-2016-3712](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3712))." causes a regression.  The win7 installer is unhappy because it can't freely modify vga registers any more while in vbe mode.  This patch introduces a new sr_vbe register set.  The vbe_update_vgaregs will fill sr_vbe[] instead of sr[].  Normal vga register reads and writes go to sr[].  Any sr register read access happens through a new sr() helper function which will read from sr_vbe[] with vbe active and from sr[] otherwise.  This way we can allow guests update sr[] registers as they want, without allowing them disrupt vbe video modes that way.

Subject: CVE-2016-3712 Qemu: vga: out-of-bounds read and integer overflow
 issues

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds read and integer overflow issue was reported in the Qemu
emulator's VGA module.

Qemu VGA module allows guest to edit certain registers in 'vbe' and 'vga'
modes. ie. guest could set certain 'VGA' registers while in 'VBE' mode. This
leads to potential integer overflow or OOB read access issues in Qemu,
resulting in DoS by crashing the Qemu process on the host. (Moderate)

A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the
host.

'CVE-2016-3712' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc. Patches are
attached herein to help fix this issue.

This issue was discovered and reported by Zuozhi Fzz of Alibaba Inc.

Thank you.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c2)  Stefan Hajnoczi    2016-09-16 08:50:45 UTC  ``` Please verify as follows:  Create a 4 MB (!) LVM volume on the host.  I have called it /dev/testvg/testlv.  Now create qcow2 metadata on the LVM volume:  $ sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 /dev/testvg/testlv 10G  (The reason for using an LVM volume instead of a regular file is that its size is fixed.  Since the LVM volume cannot grow automatically we can cause ENOSPC to happen when the guest writes to it.)  shell1$ sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -cpu host -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=raw,file=rhel72.img -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=qcow2,file=/dev/testvg/testlv,werror=stop  guest# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/vdb oflag=direct bs=4k  The guest should be paused almost immediately because /dev/testvg/testlv runs out of space and returns an ENOSPC write error.  Now launch the destination QEMU for live migration (on the same host):  shell2$ sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -cpu host -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=raw,file=rhel72.img -drive if=virtio,cache=none,format=qcow2,file=/dev/testvg/testlv,werror=stop -incoming tcp::1234 (qemu1) migrate tcp:127.0.0.1:1234  After migration has completed the guest is still paused.  Let's grow the LVM volume so the failed write request can be retried:  $ sudo lvresize -L +4M /dev/testvg/testlv (qemu2) c  Expected behavior: Guest resumes successfully when the 'c' monitor command is issued on destination QEMU.  Note that it will probably pause again very soon because the LVM volume runs out of space again.  Actual behavior: "Virtqueue size exceeded" error from destination QEMU and guest is terminated after the 'c' monitor command is issued.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c4)  Miroslav Rezanina    2016-09-20 16:03:10 UTC  ``` Fix included in qemu-kvm-1.5.3-126.el7   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c6)  huiqingding    2016-09-21 03:21:58 UTC  ``` Reproduce this bug using the following version: kernel-3.10.0-509.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-1.5.3-125.el7.x86_64  Do the test as [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1376542#c2), the detailed steps as [bz1372763 comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1372763#c11 "CLOSED ERRATA - RHSA-2016-1756 breaks migration of instances").

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

However I think this isn't a bug from the instrumentation I did with QEMU 6.8. Here are the findings:  1) The problem was introduced by commit 50d095912. The related code is in     pc_new_cpu() of hw/pc.c file. 2) IS_INTEL_CPU(env) is TRUE, implying that QEMU believes guest is an AMD CPU. 3) I instrumented cpu_x86_register() of target-i386/cpuid.c file. When no -cpu    is specified, cpu_model name is "cpu64-rhel6". So by default qemu-kvm-6.8 uses    "cpu64-rhel6" as the CPU model when nothing is specified. According to    target-i386/cpuid.c, "cpu64-rhel6" is based on AMD CPU model.  From the data collected above, I think this warning msg is legit because AMD CPU doesn't support HyperThreading.  -Wei   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1320066#c5)  Wei Huang (AMD)    2016-03-24 14:09:48 UTC  ``` Is it a common usage case not to specify "-cpu"? I am trying to understand how annoying this warning message is.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1320066#c6)  juzhang    2016-03-25 00:15:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wei Huang from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1320066#c5)) > Is it a common usage case not to specify "-cpu"? I am trying to understand > how annoying this warning message is.  Hi Wei,  I personally think it's no common scenario. However, 2 concerns.  1. Seems this is regression issue according to [comment0](show_bug.cgi?id=1320066#c0)  2. It's strange that the qemu-kvm promotes message like "AMD CPU doesn't support ..." but the qemu runs on Intel host.

Package        : qemu
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-3710 CVE-2016-3712
Debian Bug     : 823830

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.

CVE-2016-3710

    Wei Xiao and Qinghao Tang of 360.cn Inc discovered an out-of-bounds
    read and write flaw in the QEMU VGA module. A privileged guest user
    could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2016-3712

    Zuozhi Fzz of Alibaba Inc discovered potential integer overflow
    or out-of-bounds read access issues in the QEMU VGA module. A
    privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a denial of
    service (QEMU process crash).

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2585)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw and an out-of-bounds read flaw were found in the way QEMU's VGA emulator set certain VGA registers while in VBE mode. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-3712)
* An infinite loop flaw was found in the way QEMU's e1000 NIC emulation implementation processed data using transmit or receive descriptors under certain conditions. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance. (CVE-2016-1981)

Red Hat would like to thank Zuozhi Fzz (Alibaba Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-3712.

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1346982#c0)  Ademar Reis    2016-06-15 18:19:13 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1346976](show_bug.cgi?id=1346976 "CLOSED ERRATA - Regression from CVE-2016-3712: windows installer fails to start [rhel-7.3]") +++  The fix for [CVE-2016-3712](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3712) introduced a regression and we'll have to push a new update.  From the upstream patch:  """ From: Gerd Hoffmann <kraxel> Subject: [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] vga: add sr_vbe register set  Commit "fd3c136 vga: make sure vga register setup for vbe stays intact ([CVE-2016-3712](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3712))." causes a regression.  The win7 installer is unhappy because it can't freely modify vga registers any more while in vbe mode.  This patch introduces a new sr_vbe register set.  The vbe_update_vgaregs will fill sr_vbe[] instead of sr[].  Normal vga register reads and writes go to sr[].  Any sr register read access happens through a new sr() helper function which will read from sr_vbe[] with vbe active and from sr[] otherwise.  This way we can allow guests update sr[] registers as they want, without allowing them disrupt vbe video modes that way.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1318712#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-03-17 15:00:16 UTC  ``` Qemu VGA module allows guest to edit certain registers in 'vbe' and 'vga'  modes. ie. guest could set certain 'VGA' registers while in 'VBE' mode. This  leads to potential integer overflow or OOB read access issues in Qemu,   A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the  host resulting in DoS.

My understanding is that this particular security issue is not being backported to z-streams.  If that's indeed the case, then given the patches are being reviewed (BZs are POST), there's no need for a new BZ for the regression. We can simply respin the patches.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1318712#c17)  Fedora Update System    2016-05-28 23:22:17 UTC  ``` xen-4.5.3-5.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.
