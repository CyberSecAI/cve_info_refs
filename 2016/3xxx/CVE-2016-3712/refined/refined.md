  "CVE-2016-3712": {
    "description": "An integer overflow flaw and an out-of-bounds read flaw were found in the way QEMU's VGA emulator set certain VGA registers while in VBE mode. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance.",
    "affected_components": [
      "qemu",
      "qemu-kvm"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of VGA registers while in VBE mode in QEMU's VGA emulator leads to an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read vulnerability.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user can cause the QEMU process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the vulnerability requires a privileged user inside the guest VM to manipulate VGA registers."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Privileged access within the guest VM."
