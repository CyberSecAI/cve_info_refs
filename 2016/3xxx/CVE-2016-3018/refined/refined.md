- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the Web UI of IBM Security Access Manager, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to alter the intended functionality of the web application, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI of the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI, requiring user interaction for the injected script to be executed by another user of the application.
