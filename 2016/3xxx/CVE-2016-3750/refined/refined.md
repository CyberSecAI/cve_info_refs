Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3750:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the `Parcel` class handles native handles during the `dup()` operation. Specifically, if `dup()` fails when reading a native handle from a `Parcel`, the code incorrectly proceeds, resulting in an invalid `native_handle_t` being created and used. This can lead to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper error handling: The code doesn't properly check for failures of the `dup()` call when reading native handles from a `Parcel` object.
- Use-after-free: Due to the invalid native handle, the system could attempt to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to bypass operating system protections designed to isolate application data, potentially gaining access to data that the application is not authorized to access. This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local malicious application crafts a `Parcel` object containing a faulty native handle.
- This application sends the crafted parcel via binder to a privileged service.
- When the privileged service processes the parcel, it attempts to duplicate the faulty handle with `dup()`.
-  If `dup()` fails, the service then proceeds to create an invalid `native_handle_t`, potentially causing a use-after-free.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to install a malicious application on the device.
- The attacker needs the ability to communicate with a privileged process by sending a specifically crafted parcel.

**Additional Details:**
The provided source code commit (android.googlesource.com) confirms the issue and shows the fix which is to bail out if dup() fails instead of creating an invalid handle.
