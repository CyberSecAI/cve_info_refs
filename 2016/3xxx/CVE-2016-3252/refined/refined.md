- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Elevation of privilege vulnerability due to improper memory handling in the Windows kernel-mode driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, enabling them to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must first log on to the affected system. They can then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials to the system and the ability to execute a specially crafted application.
