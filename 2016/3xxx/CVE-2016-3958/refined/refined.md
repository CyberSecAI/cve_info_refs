Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3958:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- On Windows, Go loads system DLLs using `LoadLibrary`, which makes it vulnerable to DLL preloading attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerability lies in the insecure way Go loads DLLs on Windows by only using the name of the DLL and not specifying the search path.
-  This insecure method makes it possible for a malicious DLL to be loaded instead of the intended one if placed in a directory that is searched before the system directories such as the current working directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- DLL preloading attacks allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate system DLL in a location that is searched earlier in the DLL search order, such as the application's directory or a user's Downloads folder. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker places a malicious DLL with the same name as a system DLL in a directory that is searched before system directories by the vulnerable application.
- When the vulnerable application loads the DLL using `LoadLibrary`, the malicious DLL is loaded and executed instead of the intended system DLL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to a location that the vulnerable application searches for DLLs before system directories.  For instance, the attacker can place a malicious DLL in a user's downloads folder.
- The user must then launch a Go executable from this location, or another location where the attacker has placed the malicious DLL.
