## Description

[![@bradfitz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2621?u=6deb06d9916328265486504f364c80ec2d969f2c&v=4&size=48)](/bradfitz)[bradfitz](https://github.com/bradfitz)opened [on Mar 25, 2016](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14959#issue-143438939)

Taru Karttunen noted that Go should be more paranoid by default when loading DLLs.

Background:

<https://textplain.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/dll-hijacking-just-wont-die/>

Microsoft's guidelines:

<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff919712%28VS.85%29.aspx>

LoadLibraryEx docs:

[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684179(v=vs.85).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684179%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)

[@rsc](https://github.com/rsc) proposed:

> 1. Change syscall.LoadDLL to call LoadLibraryEx with flags=LOAD\_LIBRARY\_SEARCH\_SYSTEM32 instead of calling LoadLibrary. That is, LoadDLL is now secure by default and cannot load DLLs from the directory containing the executable.
> 2. Add a LoadLibraryEx to x/sys/win so that users can still get at the old behavior if they want it (by appropriate passing of flags).

CL forthcoming.

Subject: CVE request - Go - DLL loading, Big int

OSS-Security,

The Go open source project has identified two security issues that we
believe warrant the issuing of a new release:

1. On Windows, Go loads system DLLs by name with LoadLibrary, making it
vulnerable to DLL preloading attacks. Notably, if a user launched a Go
executable from their Downloads folder and malicious DLLs were in their
Downloads folder. This is being address in the following CL:
<https://golang.org/cl/21428>

2. Go has an infinite loop in several big integer routines that makes Go
programs vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks.  Programs using
HTTPS client authentication or the Go ssh server libraries are both exposed
to this vulnerability. This is being addressed in the following CL:
<https://golang.org/cl/21533>

We will release two new versions - Go 1.6.1 and 1.5.4 - both of which will
address these two issues.

Regards,
Jason Buberel
PM, Go
