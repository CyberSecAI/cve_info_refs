  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's ACPI implementation allowed overriding ACPI tables even when securelevel was enabled, which should prevent userspace from inserting untrusted privileged code. This vulnerability is present because the kernel does not properly check the securelevel before loading ACPI tables from initrd.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The kernel's ACPI table override mechanism was not disabled when securelevel was enabled, which allows for bypassing of intended security protections.",
         "Improper privilege management. The system should not load the tables from initrd without checking the securelevel to prevent manipulation by an attacker."
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker could potentially insert malicious code into the kernel by overwriting the ACPI tables, which could lead to privilege escalation or other forms of compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "A local attacker would need to overwrite the ACPI tables present in initrd, and then reboot the system. This would require the ability to modify the initrd contents before boot.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the initrd, which usually implies root or administrative access to the system before boot, but not necessarily when the kernel is running and securelevel is set."
