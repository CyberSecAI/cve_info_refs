Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `usbip_recv_xbuff` function in the Linux kernel's USB/IP implementation does not properly validate the size of incoming packets. Specifically, it uses the `actual_length` value from the network packet without verifying if it exceeds the size of the preallocated transfer buffer (`urb->transfer_buffer_length`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The lack of size validation allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary kernel memory by sending a malicious USB/IP packet with a `size` value larger than `urb->transfer_buffer_length`.
*   **Missing Input validation:** The `actual_length` field of the USB/IP packet, coming from the network, is treated as a trusted value.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (system crash):** Overwriting kernel memory can lead to system instability and crashes.
*   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** It's possible that an attacker could carefully craft the malicious packet and overwrite kernel memory in a way that allows for the execution of arbitrary code with administrative privileges. The provided content notes that an attacker may write "about 1k into RAM, albeit at an unpredictable location".

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote attack (USB/IP client scenario):** A malicious USB/IP server or an attacker impersonating a USB/IP server could send crafted packets to a vulnerable USB/IP client to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Physical attack (USB/IP server scenario):** A physically present attacker connecting a malicious USB device to the usbip server could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** For remote attacks, the attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a vulnerable system acting as a USB/IP client or impersonate a valid usbip server.
*   **Physical access:** For local attacks, the attacker needs to have physical access to a vulnerable system to be able to connect a malicious usb device acting as a usbip client or server.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in `drivers/usb/usbip/usbip_common.c`.
*   The fix involves adding a size check: `if (size > urb->transfer_buffer_length) { ... }`
*   The fix also includes logging an error and returning an error code (`-EPIPE`).
*   Various Linux distributions like Ubuntu, SUSE and openSUSE issued patches and security advisories for this CVE.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ignat Korchagin, with a fix signed off by Greg Kroah-Hartman.

The content also provides additional context, such as links to the upstream commit, mailing list discussions, and various distribution-specific security advisories, which can be used for further research.
