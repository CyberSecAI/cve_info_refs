Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-3352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from Windows' failure to properly validate NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Single Sign-On (SSO) requests during Microsoft Account (MSA) login sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of NTLM SSO requests during MSA login sessions, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially attempt to brute-force a user's NTLM password hash. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could trick a user into browsing to a malicious website, SMB or UNC path.
- An attacker could also convince a user to load a malicious document that initiates an NTLM SSO validation request without the user's consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to entice the target user to interact with malicious content.
-  The attacker does not need to be on the local network as this attack can happen over the internet.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is mitigated by ensuring proper firewall configuration. An enterprise perimeter firewall can prevent this attack.
- The security update addresses this vulnerability by preventing NTLM SSO authentication to non-private SMB resources when users are signed in to Windows via a Microsoft Account and are connected to a "Guest or public networks" firewall profile.
- VPNs are considered private networks and are therefore not affected.
- This vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure vulnerability.
- This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed but not known to be exploited at the time of the security bulletin's publication.
