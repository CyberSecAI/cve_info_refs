Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the Windows font library handles specially crafted embedded fonts, specifically TrueType fonts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve information from a targeted system through improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI).
- This information disclosure can be leveraged to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a security feature in Windows.
- The vulnerability exists in the way Windows GDI component handles objects in memory

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure**: An attacker can retrieve information from a targeted system which can be used to circumvent ASLR. This could be combined with another vulnerability such as Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then needs to convince a user to visit this website, often through links in emails or instant messages or by tricking users into opening email attachments.
- **File Sharing Attack:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted document file that exploits the vulnerability and then trick a user into opening it.
-  An attacker would need to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted website or document.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file or access the malicious website.
- For a direct attack, an attacker needs to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Important" and is part of the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-120.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts and how GDI handles memory addresses.
- The document provides an exploitability index indicating that exploitation is "less likely" for the latest software release and "more likely" for older software releases.
- Multiple Microsoft products are affected, including various versions of Windows, .NET Framework, and Microsoft Office products.
- The vulnerabilities could lead to a full system compromise if combined with another vulnerability.

**Affected software:**
- Various versions of Windows
- Microsoft .NET Framework
- Microsoft Office
- Skype for Business
- Microsoft Lync
- Microsoft Silverlight
