- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to the software's failure to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain control of the affected system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Opening a specially crafted file using vulnerable Microsoft Office software.
    - Email attachments containing the malicious file.
    - Web-based attacks where the user is convinced to visit a website hosting the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted file and convince the user to open it. For web based attacks, the attacker needs a website to host the file. No other special capabilities are mentioned.
