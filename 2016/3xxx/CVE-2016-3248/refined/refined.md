Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3248:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the JScript and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory. Specifically, when these engines render objects, memory corruption can occur.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory corruption:** Improper handling of objects in memory by the scripting engines leads to memory corruption. This corruption can allow arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:**
    - Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They then need to convince a user to visit the website via social engineering or other means.
    - Malicious content can be injected into compromised websites or websites that accept/host user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Embedded ActiveX controls:** Attackers can embed malicious ActiveX controls marked "safe for initialization" in applications or Microsoft Office documents that host the IE/Edge rendering engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted web page or embed a malicious ActiveX control.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious content through social engineering tactics like emails or instant messages, or by tricking them into opening attachments.

**Affected software:**
- Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 on Windows clients and servers
- Microsoft Edge on Windows 10

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is addressed by modifying how the JScript and VBScript engines handle objects in memory.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The provided text also mentions a workaround to restrict access to vbscript.dll and jscript.dll to potentially mitigate the vulnerability, but this might affect websites that utilize VBScript or JScript.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can provide some mitigation for systems where EMET is configured to work with IE or Edge.
- This vulnerability also affects Microsoft Edge.
