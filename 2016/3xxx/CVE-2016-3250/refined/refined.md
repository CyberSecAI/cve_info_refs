- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Elevation of privilege vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would first have to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have valid credentials to log on to the system, and be able to execute a specially crafted application.
