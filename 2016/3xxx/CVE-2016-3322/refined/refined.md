## Analysis of CVE-2016-3322

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge improperly access objects in memory. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper access of objects in memory by Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain control of the affected system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted website:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the memory corruption vulnerabilities.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into legitimate websites, or websites that host user-provided content, to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- **Phishing/Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on convincing users to visit the malicious website, typically through enticements in emails or instant messages, or through opening malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted website or inject content into a vulnerable website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious content using Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge

**Affected Software:**
- Internet Explorer 11 on Windows clients (Critical) and Windows servers (Moderate).
- Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 (Critical).

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge handle objects in memory.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The vulnerability is not publicly disclosed or exploited.
