  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "`TextParseUtil.translateVariables` evaluates a given String with OGNL. Before Struts 2.3.20, a specially crafted String incorporating ANTLR tooling can, when passed to said method, cause a remote code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the `TextParseUtil.translateVariables` method that does not filter malicious OGNL expressions, allowing for remote code execution when unsanitized user input is passed to this method."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A developer crafting a Struts based web application might pass unsanitized user input to `TextParseUtil.translateVariables` or ActionSupport's getText methods."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted String incorporating ANTLR tooling that can cause a remote code execution if passed to the vulnerable method. The attacker needs to find a way to pass this malicious String to `TextParseUtil.translateVariables` or `ActionSupport`'s `getText` methods.",
	"details": "The Struts 2 framework does not pass any user modifiable input to this method, neither directly nor indirectly. The vulnerability arises when developers pass unsanitized user input to the vulnerable method."
