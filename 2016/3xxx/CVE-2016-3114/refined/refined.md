Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3114:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the Kallithea application. Logged-in users were granted excessive permissions over pull requests and comments, beyond what their intended access level should allow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Logged-in users with read access to a repository could edit or delete open pull requests associated with *any* repository.
*   **Insecure Comment Handling:**  Logged-in users with read access to just one repository could delete any comment from any repository if they knew the comment ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized modification of pull requests:** Attackers could manipulate open pull requests, potentially leading to code injection or disruption of development workflows.
*   **Arbitrary comment deletion:** Attackers could delete comments from any repository, possibly leading to the removal of important discussions, feedback, or code review notes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack is carried out by logged-in users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account and be logged into the Kallithea application.
*   For pull request manipulation, the attacker needs read access to at least one repository.
*   For comment deletion, the attacker needs read access to at least one repository and knowledge of the comment's ID.
