Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the combination of two factors:
1.  **REST Plugin with `!` operator:** The Apache Struts REST plugin allows the use of the `!` operator in requests.
2. **Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) enabled:** When DMI is enabled in Struts, the `!` operator can be exploited to invoke arbitrary methods, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Unsafe Input Handling:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate input when DMI is enabled, allowing the attacker to inject malicious OGNL expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker can gain full control over the affected server by executing arbitrary code.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The compromised server could be used to spread malware to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP requests that include the malicious OGNL expressions within the request URI. The `!` operator is used to trigger Dynamic Method Invocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Struts application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the malicious OGNL expression to trigger the remote code execution.
*   **Target Application Vulnerability:** The target application must be running a vulnerable version of Struts with the REST plugin enabled and Dynamic Method Invocation enabled.

**More details than official CVE description:**

* The provided content details the vulnerable versions of Apache Struts (2.3.20 - 2.3.28, excluding 2.3.20.3 and 2.3.24.3) and the specific conditions for exploitation (REST plugin, Dynamic Method Invocation).
* The provided metasploit module gives a clear view of how the exploit can be achieved, it includes methods for checking the vulnerability, generating the payload and finally executing it.

In summary, CVE-2016-3087 is a critical vulnerability in Apache Struts that allows for remote code execution through the REST plugin when Dynamic Method Invocation is enabled.
