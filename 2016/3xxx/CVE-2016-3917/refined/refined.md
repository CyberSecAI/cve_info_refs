Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3917:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the fingerprint authentication process is handled during login. It was possible to authenticate the wrong user using fingerprint authentication, leading to a lock screen bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper user ID binding:** The system did not properly bind the user ID to the fingerprint authentication process when starting authentication.
- **Missing confirmation:**  The system did not confirm the correct user ID when authentication was completed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Lock screen bypass:** A malicious device owner could bypass the lock screen and gain access to the device as a different user account.
- **Unauthorized access:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive user data and potentially perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local attacker:** The attacker needs physical access to the device and must be a device owner.
- **Fingerprint authentication:** The attacker would need to initiate the fingerprint authentication process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Must have physical access to the device.
- Must be a device owner (or potentially have a compromised device owner's fingerprint enrolled).
- Must trigger the fingerprint authentication mechanism.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves binding the user ID when authentication starts and confirming the ID when authentication completes.
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions 6.0.1 and 7.0.
- The fix was implemented in AOSP commit `f5334952131afa835dd3f08601fb3bced7b781cd` and cherry-picked from commit `837d052ed4b5b75dfd4af44f5ad268e683bf2e13`.

The provided information provides more detail than the official CVE description, elaborating on the specific weakness in user ID binding and its impact on fingerprint login.
