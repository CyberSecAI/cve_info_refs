## Analysis of CVE-2016-3204

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3204:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the JScript and VBScript engines handle objects in memory. Specifically, there is a memory corruption vulnerability when rendering content, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The scripting engines (JScript and VBScript) improperly handle objects in memory, which can corrupt memory. This can be exploited to allow execution of arbitrary code.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute code within the security context of the current user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take full control of the system.
- **System Compromise:** This can result in the attacker being able to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** Attackers can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability. By convincing a user to visit the site, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers could inject malicious code into legitimate websites that they have compromised, and websites that accept or host user-provided content. This can include specially crafted advertisements or user-provided content.
- **ActiveX controls:** Embedding a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious site or interact with malicious content (e.g., through phishing or social engineering).
- **Web hosting or compromise:**  The attacker needs to either host a malicious website or inject the malicious code into a legitimate website to carry out the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by security updates that modify how the JScript and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.
- A workaround involves restricting access to vbscript.dll and jscript.dll, although this may break websites that use these technologies.
- The vulnerability affects systems running various versions of Windows, including Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
- It is rated "Critical" for client operating systems and "Moderate" for server operating systems.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated with EMET by enabling security mitigations.
- The update is part of cumulative updates for Internet Explorer (MS16-084) and JScript/VBScript (MS16-086).
