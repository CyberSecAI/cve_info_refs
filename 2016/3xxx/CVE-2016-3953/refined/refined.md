Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of a hardcoded encryption key (`yoursecret`) in the web2py framework's example application for encrypting session cookies. This key is used in conjunction with the Pickle library, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if manipulated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The use of a static, well-known key for session cookie encryption.
2.  **Insecure Deserialization (Pickle):** The framework's reliance on Python's `pickle.loads` function for deserializing session cookie data, which can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This would grant the attacker complete control over the affected system. Specifically, the attacker can:
*   Craft malicious session cookies by serializing a malicious object.
*   By using the known key, encrypt the crafted serialized object.
*   Send this malicious cookie to the target server.
*   When the server processes the malicious cookie, the pickle deserialization will execute the attacker's arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through manipulating and sending a crafted session cookie. The attacker would need to:
1.  Craft a malicious serialized payload using Python's pickle library which includes malicious code.
2.  Use the hardcoded encryption key (`yoursecret`), the server's `secure_loads` implementation, and related encryption processes to encrypt the malicious serialized payload.
3.  Submit this crafted, encrypted session cookie to the web server.
4.  Upon processing the crafted cookie, the server will decrypt and then deserialize the payload, executing arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know that the target application is using the vulnerable web2py framework, specifically the vulnerable example application with the default configuration.
*   The attacker needs to know the hardcoded encryption key: `yoursecret`.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target web application.

**Additional Information (from the blog post):**
*   The vulnerability was present in the default example application of web2py, which was enabled by default.
*   The blog post provides a proof-of-concept by injecting a sleep command into the session cookie, which was executed by the server and resulted in a delay.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by generating a unique session\_cookie\_key in web2py version 2.14.2.

In summary, CVE-2016-3953 is a critical vulnerability because the usage of a hardcoded key combined with insecure deserialization (via pickle) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted session cookie to a vulnerable web2py instance.
