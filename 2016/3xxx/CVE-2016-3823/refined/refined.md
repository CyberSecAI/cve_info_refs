Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3823:

**CVE-2016-3823**

*   **Root Cause:** An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Mediaserver component. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of heap pointers, which do not point to user virtual addresses during secure sessions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper access of heap pointers within the Mediaserver process, specifically in `mm-video-v4l2` during the video processing. These heap pointers are not properly validated before access, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds access.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the privileged Mediaserver process. This could result in the malicious application gaining elevated capabilities not normally accessible to third-party applications.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A local malicious application would need to trigger the vulnerable code path in Mediaserver, likely through a specially crafted media file or data stream. The application would need to be running locally on the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device. The application needs to be able to interact with the media processing services to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**

The provided commit messages further clarify the vulnerability:
*  The core issue involves heap pointers not pointing to user virtual addresses during secure sessions in the `mm-video-v4l2` component.
* The fix involves setting these heap pointers to `NULL` and adding checks to prevent accessing them when they are invalid.
* The commit messages associate this issue with bug IDs 28815329 and 28920116.
