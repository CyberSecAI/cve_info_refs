## Security Update for Common Log File System Driver (3193706)

Published: November 8, 2016 | Updated: December 13, 2016

**Version:** 2.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege when the [Windows Common Log File System (CLFS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) driver improperly handles objects in memory. In a local attack scenario, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by running a specially crafted application to take complete control over the affected system. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could run processes in an elevated context.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how CLFS handles objects in memory. For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3193706](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3193706).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when the [Windows Common Log File System (CLFS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run processes in an elevated context.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system, and then run a specially crafted application to take control over the affected system. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how CLFS handles objects in memory
