Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper input and origin checks during the reception of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages in the `libndp` library. Specifically, the library failed to validate the hop limit and source address of received NDP messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `libndp` library did not properly check the IPv6 hop limit in NDP messages, allowing messages that have been routed (and therefore shouldn't be processed) to be accepted. According to RFC4861, NDP messages must originate with a hop limit of 255 and should not have been routed.
*   **Improper Origin Check:** The library did not verify if the source address of Router Advertisement (RA) and Redirect messages were link-local addresses. According to RFC4861, these messages should originate only from link-local addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could advertise a malicious node as a router, causing network connectivity disruption.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** By advertising a rogue router, an attacker could intercept and potentially modify network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker located on a non-local network could send crafted NDP messages to a vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the victim's network segment.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send malicious NDP messages.
*  **Non-Local Network Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same local link as the victim.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `libndp` versions prior to 1.6, and affects applications using this library, such as NetworkManager.
*   Patches to fix this vulnerability enforce that the hop limit must be 255 to ensure the NDP message has not been routed, and also reject Router Advertisements and Redirect messages from non-link-local addresses.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Julien Bernard of Viag√©nie.
*   The fix requires updating the `libndp` package and restarting applications utilizing it.
