Additionally, the Android Security Bulletin for July 2016 explicitly lists CVE-2016-3763 and its associated information, indicating a match.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Android handles Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) scripts. Specifically, the URL path, along with username/password embedded in the URL, were being passed to PAC scripts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information (credentials) through the URL passed to PAC scripts. This is insecure as PAC scripts can be potentially malicious.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker controlling a malicious PAC script can potentially gain access to user credentials if those credentials are included in the URL passed to the script. This could lead to unauthorized access to various accounts and services.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious PAC script. An attacker could potentially lure a user into using a malicious proxy configuration or intercept the network connection to inject a PAC script.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control or inject a malicious PAC script that the vulnerable device would download and use. The attacker could be in a man-in-the-middle position, or could have compromised a proxy server.

**Additional Details from the Android Security Bulletin:**

*   **Severity:** Moderate.
*   **Affected Components:** Proxy Auto-Config component.
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure.
*   **Mitigation:** The patch prevents the URL path and user credentials from being passed to PAC scripts.
*   **Reported Date:** March 10, 2016.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-3763 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Android's Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) component. It stems from passing the URL path, which can contain sensitive information like usernames and passwords, to PAC scripts. This can allow a malicious PAC script to access and potentially steal these credentials. The vulnerability is rated as Moderate and was addressed in the July 2016 Android Security Bulletin.
