Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-3172:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `tree.php` file of Cacti versions 0.8.8g and earlier. Specifically, the `parent_id` parameter within the `item_edit` action is used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, where user-supplied input (`parent_id`) is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database.
- **Data Breach:** This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data within the Cacti database.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS v3 score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable parameter is passed via an HTTP GET request, specifically in the URL.
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cacti application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid login credentials to the Cacti application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Cacti server.
- **Low Privilege:** Only low privileges within the application are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable code is located in `tree.php` line 208, where the `parent_id` GET parameter is used directly in a SQL query:
```php
$default_sorting_type = db_fetch_cell("select sort_children_type from graph_tree_items where id=" . $_GET["parent_id"]);
```
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided that demonstrates the vulnerability using a sleep command:
`http://target/cacti-0.8.8g/tree.php?action=item_edit&tree_id=2&parent_id=8%20and%20sleep(1>)`

**Additional Notes:**
- A fix for this vulnerability involves validating the `parent_id` parameter using `input_validate_input_number(get_request_var("parent_id"))`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity by SUSE.
-  SUSE Bugzilla entries: 971357, 974013, both are marked as RESOLVED/FIXED
