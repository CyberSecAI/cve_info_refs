Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software due to improper handling of objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is the software's failure to properly manage memory when handling certain objects, leading to a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Reduced Impact for Limited Accounts:** Users with accounts configured with fewer user rights are less affected than those with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- **Email Attack:** An attacker can send the malicious file to a user via email and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host or leverage a compromised website hosting the crafted malicious file, and convince a user to click a link to open the file.
- **Preview Pane:** The preview pane in Outlook can be an attack vector for some related memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafting Malicious File:** The attacker must be capable of crafting a specially designed Office file to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file, either through email, malicious links, or other social engineering techniques.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided documents indicate that this vulnerability is part of a larger set of memory corruption vulnerabilities within Microsoft Office.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.
- The documents specify that the severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Important", but if the user has administrative privileges, the potential impact can be critical.
