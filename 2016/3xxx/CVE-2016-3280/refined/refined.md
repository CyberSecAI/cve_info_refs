Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-3280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Office software's failure to properly handle objects in memory when processing specially crafted files. Specifically, the issue lies in how Office handles RTF (Rich Text Format) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- Improper handling of RTF file format when opened using an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full rights.
- Users with fewer rights would be less impacted but still vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email: An attacker sends a specially crafted RTF file to the user, convincing them to open it.
- Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a website (or uses a compromised website) containing the malicious RTF file. They must convince the victim to visit the site and open the file.
- Preview pane: If the severity of the vulnerability is marked as "Critical" in the "Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings" table then the Preview Pane can also act as an attack vector for CVE-2016-3280.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted RTF file that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to the victim through email or host it on a website.
- Ability to convince the user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided document mentions specific workarounds, which include using the Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent Office from opening RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources. This involves setting registry keys to block RTF files or to open them in protected view and is discussed in the workarounds section of the provided document.

- The document also provides a more extensive list of affected software, including various versions of Microsoft Office, Excel, Word, and other related products. The specific severity ratings for each affected product varies from Important to Critical.
