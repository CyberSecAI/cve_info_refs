Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-3214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in the Chakra JavaScript engine. Specifically, it occurs when the engine renders and handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in the Chakra JavaScript engine.
- Improper handling of objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take control of the system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability via Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to visit this website.
- **Embedding in applications:** An attacker could embed an ActiveX control marked as "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document, which then hosts the Edge rendering engine, and use this to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** An attacker could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject malicious content that is rendered by the Chakra JavaScript engine in Microsoft Edge.
- Ability to convince a user to load the malicious content, either by visiting a malicious website, opening a malicious document or using a compromised website.
- The attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability in memory handling in the Chakra engine.

**Additional Notes**
- This specific vulnerability only affects Windows 10 Version 1511.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows Clients and "Moderate" for Windows Servers.
