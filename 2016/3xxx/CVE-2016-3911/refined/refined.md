{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Zygote process was not handling communication requests correctly, leading to potential issues when partially reading a response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the Zygote process's handling of communication requests. It was writing partial requests and not returning (or throwing) an error early after partially reading a response. This behavior could be exploited by a malicious application to potentially trigger a bug or gain unauthorized access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, leading to local privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a local malicious application that can exploit the communication flaw in the Zygote process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. They do not need to have any special privileges to start."
