Package        : optipng
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2191

Hans Jerry Illikainen discovered that missing input sanitising in the
BMP processing code of the optipng PNG optimiser may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed file is
processed.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.6.4-1+deb7u2. This update also fixes CVE-2015-7801, which
was originally targeted for a wheezy point update.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.5-1+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your optipng packages.

# USN-2951-1: OptiPNG vulnerabilities

18 April 2016

OptiPNG could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.
