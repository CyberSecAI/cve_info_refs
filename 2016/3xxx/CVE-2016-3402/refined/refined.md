{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'URL links' zimlet incorrectly identifies and renders specific text patterns as clickable links, even when they are not intended to be URLs. This occurs because the regex used by the zimlet to identify UNC paths was too broad. This caused the system to parse the string '\\\\'onmouseover=\"alert(/xss/)\" as a link.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization and rendering of user-controlled content. The vulnerability is persistent because the malicious code is stored as part of an email message, and can be triggered anytime the message is viewed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an email message, which will be executed when a user moves the mouse over the generated link, potentially leading to account compromise, information theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted email containing the payload: '\\\\'onmouseover=\"alert(/xss/)\" (or similar) to a victim.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user of a vulnerable Zimbra server. No special access or privileges on the server are required."
