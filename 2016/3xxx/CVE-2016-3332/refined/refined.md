- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver improperly handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory handling within the CLFS driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run processes in an elevated context, potentially gaining complete control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker needs to log on to the system and then execute a specially crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to execute applications.
