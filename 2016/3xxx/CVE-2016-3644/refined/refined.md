  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a heap overflow in Symantec's MIME message parsing when cleaning or removing components detected as malicious. The code assumes filenames cannot exceed 77 characters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Heap overflow",
    "Incorrect assumption about maximum filename length during MIME parsing."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The heap overflow can lead to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted MIME message with a long filename.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a malicious MIME message to a system using vulnerable Symantec software."
