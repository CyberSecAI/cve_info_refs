```
Root cause of vulnerability: Information disclosure vulnerability in the Qualcomm USB driver.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to access data outside of its permission levels, potentially leaking sensitive information. It requires that a privileged process is already compromised.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker could gain access to sensitive data without explicit user permission.

Attack vectors: A local malicious application can exploit the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to install and run a malicious application on the device, and this application needs to compromise a privileged process.
