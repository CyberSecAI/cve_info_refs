Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3167:

**CVE Description:**

The vulnerability is an open redirect issue in Drupal 6, specifically within the `drupal_goto()` function. This function improperly decodes the `$_REQUEST['destination']` parameter before using it, which allows attackers to bypass the open redirect protection and redirect users to arbitrary external URLs.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Improper decoding of the `$_REQUEST['destination']` parameter within the `drupal_goto()` function. The function fails to handle double-encoded destination parameters, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can control the redirect URL, allowing them to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing pages, malware download sites, or other malicious resources.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Open redirect can be used as a component in phishing campaigns, making it difficult for users to distinguish between a legitimate and malicious link.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Redirects can be chained, potentially leading to more complex attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:**  Attackers manipulate the `destination` parameter within the URL, double-encoding it to bypass the redirect protection mechanism of the `drupal_goto()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a crafted URL with a double-encoded `destination` parameter.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable Drupal version:** The attack is specific to Drupal 6 installations.

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attack is not possible for sites running on PHP 5.4.7 or greater.

**Additional Notes:**

- The CVE assignment team noted that the issue was given a CVE ID because the Drupal vendor issued a security advisory. A different vendor could have taken the position that PHP 5.4.x is obsolete and the product offers no guarantee of correct behavior on older PHP versions.
- The vulnerability affects Drupal 6 and is considered a "Moderately Critical" issue.
