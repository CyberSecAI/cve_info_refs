  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the serial peripheral interface driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
      "This is achieved by exploiting a weakness in the serial peripheral interface driver."
