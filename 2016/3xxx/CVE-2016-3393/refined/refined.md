Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-3393:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided document "Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-120 - Critical" directly mentions **CVE-2016-3393** as the "Windows Graphics Component RCE Vulnerability". This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability lies in the way the **Windows GDI (Graphics Device Interface)** component handles objects in memory.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper handling of objects in memory within the Windows GDI component. This leads to a **remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
    - Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
        - Take complete control of the affected system.
        - Install programs.
        - View, change, or delete data.
        - Create new accounts with full user rights.
    - Users with fewer privileges on the system would be less impacted.

**5. Attack vectors:**
    - **Web-based attack:**
        - The attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
        - The attacker convinces the user to visit the website via email, instant message, or other means.
    - **File sharing attack:**
        - The attacker provides a specially crafted document that exploits the vulnerability.
        - The attacker convinces the user to open the document.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to either visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
    - No special network position or existing system access is explicitly needed, apart from the ability to deliver malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows GDI handles objects in memory.
   -  The vulnerability is marked as **Critical**.
   -  The vulnerability was reportedly being exploited in the wild at the time of the bulletin's release.
   - No mitigating factors or workarounds were identified by Microsoft at the time of the security bulletin release.
