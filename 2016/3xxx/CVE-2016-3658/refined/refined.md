Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is an illegal read within the `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagLongLong8Array` function in `tif_dirwrite.c` of libtiff.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The code attempts to dereference a pointer (`ma`) without validating if the pointer is valid. This occurs in a loop when writing TIFF directory entries. In the reported crash, the pointer has a value of `0x0` which is an invalid memory address and results in segmentation fault.
*   Specifically, the issue lies in line 1625: `if (*ma>0xFFFFFFFF)`. The code does not check if `ma` is NULL before dereferencing.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `tiffset` command-line tool.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to a segmentation fault and program crash.
*   The provided stack trace confirms a crash when trying to access the invalid memory address.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image file that, when processed using `tiffset`, triggers the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code is in `tif_dirwrite.c`.
*   The `tiffset` tool is used to modify the TIFF file, which invokes the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to create a specially crafted TIFF image.
*   The attacker needs the ability to execute the `tiffset` tool on a system with a vulnerable version of libtiff.
*   The user needs to be enticed to process a malicous image file via the tiffset utility.

**Additional Details:**
*   The bug report on bugzilla.maptools.org indicates this vulnerability is a duplicate of [bug 2500](show_bug.cgi?id=2500), which was previously assigned CVE-2014-8127. This suggests that the root cause was present in an earlier version, and perhaps the fix was incomplete or missed a specific case.
*   The Gentoo security advisory also lists this CVE, confirming its severity and need for an upgrade.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3844-1) includes this CVE along with others, indicating the vulnerability was addressed in updated packages.
*   The `value` variable passed to the function is NULL `value=0x0`.
*   The vulnerable code is within the function `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagLongLong8Array` in tif_dirwrite.c.

In summary, CVE-2016-3658 is caused by an illegal memory access due to a missing NULL pointer check in libtiff's `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagLongLong8Array` function. This can be exploited using the `tiffset` tool, leading to a denial-of-service.
