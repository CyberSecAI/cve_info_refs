{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way the affected components handle objects in memory. Specifically, it is related to how `WININET.dll` parses HTTP status lines.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure due to improper memory handling in affected components.",
	  "Out-of-bounds read in `CHttpHeaderParser::ParseStatusLine` method of `WININET.dll`."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could obtain information to further compromise a target system. Specifically, a crafted HTTP response can cause `WININET` to read data beyond the end of a buffer. This can lead to disclosure of information stored after the memory block.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A web-based attack where an attacker hosts a website designed to exploit the vulnerability, tricking the user into visiting it.",
      "Compromised websites or sites accepting user-provided content that host specially crafted content.",
	  "Sending a crafted HTTP response to an application that uses WININET."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted website or control a server that responds to an HTTP request with a specially crafted response, and convince users to take action (e.g. click a link). An attacker needs to control an HTTP server and have a client make a request to it.",
	"additional_information": "The size of the read can be controlled through the HTTP response. The vulnerability affects multiple Microsoft applications that use `WININET` to handle HTTP requests including Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Windows Media Player. Disabling Javascript in web browsers can mitigate the attack for those attack vectors."
