Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper HTML sanitization when displaying user-provided content within the Business Space feature of IBM Business Process Manager and IBM Business Monitor. This allows users to inject arbitrary HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTML Injection:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or escape HTML input provided by users, leading to an HTML injection vulnerability. This means that malicious HTML tags and attributes can be embedded into the application's output.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:**  The application lacks proper validation or sanitization of user-supplied input that is later displayed to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Malicious Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code. When a victim views the page containing this injected HTML, the code will execute within the victim's web browser.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected HTML can contain JavaScript, which can be used to perform a variety of actions within the security context of the hosting site, such as:
    - Stealing cookies
    - Modifying content on the page
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
- **Control Over Layout:** Attackers can control parts of the layout for other users, potentially causing confusion, phishing, or hiding malicious elements.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User-Provided Content:** The attack vector is through any feature that allows users to create and display content to other users within Business Space.
- **Network-Based Attack:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious HTML through the application's interface or APIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the IBM Business Process Manager or IBM Business Monitor, and they need to have the ability to input content to the Business Space.
- **Knowledge of Input Fields:**  The attacker needs to know which input fields are vulnerable to HTML injection.
- **Web Browser:**  An attacker needs to have a web browser to carry out the injection. The attack requires a user to view the page with the malicious content using their web browser.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, Standard, and Express, as well as IBM Business Monitor.
-  The fix involves escaping HTML when displaying user provided content.
- The vulnerability is referenced as JR56300 within the IBM ecosystem.
-  CVSS v3 score is provided: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
-  The fix is available as an interim fix and as part of a cumulative fix for later versions.
