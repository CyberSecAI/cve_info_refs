Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown for CVE-2016-3206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the JScript and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory. Specifically, the engines do not properly render objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that improper handling of objects in memory leads to memory corruption, which can be exploited to gain control of the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** Attackers can host a malicious website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Malicious content can be embedded into compromised websites or websites that allow user-provided content or advertisements.
- **ActiveX controls:** An attacker could embed a specially crafted ActiveX control (marked "safe for initialization") in an application or Microsoft Office document, which hosts the IE rendering engine, to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the user to view a specially crafted webpage or open a malicious document/application. This often requires social engineering tactics, such as enticing a user via email or instant message.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the system initially, but can gain them through successful exploitation of the vulnerability if the user is running with administrative rights.
