After analyzing the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3132:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a double free within the `SplDoublyLinkedList::offsetSet` function in the `ext/spl/spl_dllist.c` file in PHP versions prior to 7.0.6. This occurs when an invalid index is provided to the `offsetSet` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Double Free: The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `zval` (PHP's internal data structure for holding values) associated with a given offset is freed twice under specific conditions.
-  Lack of Input Validation: The function doesn't properly validate the offset index before attempting to free memory, leading to the double free when an invalid offset is given.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this double free vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution. The double free can corrupt the heap leading to control over the execution flow.
*   **Information Disclosure**: As part of exploiting this, leaked memory may be disclosed which can assist in exploitation.
*   **Denial of Service:** The double free can lead to a crash which can lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted index passed to the `SplDoublyLinkedList::offsetSet` function.
- This can be achieved remotely via HTTP requests or locally in hardened php environments.
-  An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing invalid indexes in user-supplied input such as query parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute PHP code, either locally or remotely.
- For remote code execution, the attacker would require a web server running a vulnerable version of PHP.
- For local exploitation, the attacker needs access to execute PHP code.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in `ext/spl/spl_dllist.c`, specifically line 833:
    ```c
    if (index < 0 || index >= intern->llist->count) {
        zval_ptr_dtor(value);
        zend_throw_exception(spl_ce_OutOfRangeException, "Offset invalid or out of range", 0);
        return;
    }
    ```
*   The `zval_ptr_dtor(value)` function is called to free the value when the offset is invalid.
*   The value is also freed later by zend vm during stack cleanup, hence the double free.
   ```c
   EG(current_execute_data) = call->prev_execute_data;
    zend_vm_stack_free_args(call);
   ```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in PHP 7.x before version 7.0.6.
*   The bug report confirms that it was fixed in PHP 7.0.6
*   The vulnerability is classified as "critical".

In summary, CVE-2016-3132 is a double-free vulnerability in PHP's `SplDoublyLinkedList::offsetSet` that can be triggered through invalid index input, leading to potential arbitrary code execution, information disclosure or denial of service.
