## Security Update for Microsoft Office (3170008)

Published: July 12, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* Office handles objects in memory
* Certain functions handle objects in memory
* Windows validates input before loading libraries

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3170008](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3170008).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

Note that where the severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector for [CVE-2016-3280](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-3280), [CVE-2016-3281](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-3281), and [CVE-2016-3282](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-3282). The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

The following [workaround](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

**Workaround for CVE-2016-3280**

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent Office from opening RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **For Office 2007**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:
  ```
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  ```
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **1**.

     **Note** To use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2007, all of the latest Office 2007 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.

  **For Office 2010**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:
  ```
          [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

  ```
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **2**.
  3. Set the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value to **0**.

     **For Office 2013**
  4. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:
  ```
          [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

  ```
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **2**.
  3. Set the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value to **0**.

  **Impact of Workaround**. Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922849](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922849) will be unable to open documents saved in the RTF format.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  **For Office 2007**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:
  ```
          [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  ```
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.

  **For Office 2010**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:
  ```
         [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

  ```
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.
  3. Leave the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value set to **0**.

  **For Office 2013**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:
  ```
          [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

  ```
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.
  3. Leave the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value set to **0**.
* **Prevent Word from loading RTF files**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Interactive managed script method**

  **For Word 2007**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, in the **Open** box, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
  ```
          HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock

  ```

  Note that if the **FileOpenBlock** subkey does not exist, you must create it. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Select the **Security** subkey.

  b. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Key**.

  c. Type **FileOpenBlock**, and then press **Enter**.

  3. After you select the **FileOpenBlock** subkey, locate the DWORD value **RtfFiles**.

     Note that if this value does not exist, you must create it. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD** value.

  b. Type **RtfFiles** and then press **Enter**.

  c. Right-click **RtfFiles** and then click **Modify**.

  d. In the **Value** data box, type **1**, and then click **OK**.

  e. On the **File** menu, click **Exit** to exit Registry Editor.

  **Managed deployment script method**

  **For Word 2007**

  1. Save the following to a file with a .reg extension (For example Disable\_RTF\_In\_Word.reg):
  ```
          [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
          "RtfFiles"=dword:00000001

  ```
  2. Run the above registry script created in step 1 on the target machine with the following command from an administrator command prompt:

     **Regedit / s Disable\_RTF\_In\_Word.reg**

     **Note** RTF files will not be readable by Word.

## Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2016-3279

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the Office software improperly handles the parsing of file formats. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, to successfully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to use it in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to take advantage of the security feature bypass vulnerability and run arbitrary code. To exploit the vulnerability would require that an attacker convince a user to open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office software handles the parsing of file formats.
