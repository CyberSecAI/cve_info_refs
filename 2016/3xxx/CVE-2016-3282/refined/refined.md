- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office software improperly handling objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the system, install software, modify data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires a user to open a specially crafted file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software. Attackers can deliver the malicious file via email or a website. In some cases, the preview pane can also be an attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted file and convince the user to open it with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software. They could achieve this through email or by hosting the file on a website. No further information is provided about the attacker's required position.
