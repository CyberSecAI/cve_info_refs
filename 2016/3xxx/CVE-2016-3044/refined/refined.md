  "CVE-2016-3044": {
    "related": true,
    "description": "A denial of service vulnerability in KVM on Power where a guest can cause a host CPU to hang, spinning in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled. This was caused by the way the Linux kernel's ASN.1 DER decoder processed certain certificate files with tags of indefinite length, leading to a potential privilege escalation as well. ",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "A flaw in the Linux kernel's ASN.1 DER decoder that processed certain certificate files with tags of indefinite length.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of indefinite length tags in ASN.1 DER decoding.",
         "Infinite loop vulnerability in KVM on Power with interrupts disabled"
      ],
      "impact": "A local, unprivileged user could use a specially crafted X.509 certificate DER file to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. It could also cause a host CPU to hang, spinning in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled leading to denial of service.",
      "attack_vector": "Local attack vector by crafting a specific X.509 certificate DER file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local, unprivileged user capable of creating a specific X.509 certificate DER file."
