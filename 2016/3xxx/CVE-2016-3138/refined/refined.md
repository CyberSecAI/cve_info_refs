{
  "CVE-2016-3138": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters does not validate endpoint descriptors.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insufficient validation of endpoint descriptors in the USB abstract device control driver."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (system crash).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access to the system is required.",
      "Attacker needs to insert a specially crafted USB device."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Physically proximate attacker with the ability to insert a USB device."
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability exists in the USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters. This driver does not validate endpoint descriptors, which can lead to a system crash if invalid descriptors are provided by the USB device."
  }
