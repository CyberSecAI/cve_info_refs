{
  "CVE-2016-3295": {
    "Root cause": "Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities exist in the way that Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge access objects in memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially gaining the same user rights, and if the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted website viewed in Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge",
       "Compromised websites or websites with user-provided content",
        "Malicious .URL files sent via email or instant message",
        "ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' embedded in application or Microsoft Office document"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted website or have the ability to add malicious content to websites. They must then convince the user to view this content. In the case of .URL files, the attacker must convince the user to open the malicious file. In the case of ActiveX controls, the attacker must convince the user to open the application or document containing the exploit."
