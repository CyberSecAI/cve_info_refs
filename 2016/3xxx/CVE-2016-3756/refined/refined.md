Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3756:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2016-3756
*   **Description:** A denial of service vulnerability exists in Mediaserver. A specially crafted file can cause a device hang or reboot.
*  **Root Cause:** Memory corruption during processing of a media file. Specifically, this CVE is related to the `tremolo` library, a part of the Android media framework.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of media file data can lead to memory corruption and a denial of service condition.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (device hang or reboot). This can disrupt the normal operation of the device and make it temporarily unusable.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by processing specially crafted media files.
    *  This could happen through various means, including:
        *   Email attachments
        *   Web browsing (visiting a malicious website)
        *   MMS (multimedia messaging)

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send or cause the device to process a specially crafted media file.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content also contains code commits related to fixing the vulnerability.
     *  The first commit message "Decoder: Set u1_long_term_reference_flag to 0 for error concealmen" indicates that the fix involves setting a flag to 0 during error concealment, possibly to prevent a crash or infinite loop situation that can cause denial of service.
     *  The commit messages referencing the bug number `28556125` are related to "Check partword is in range for # of partitions". This suggests a bounds checking error was found in the partword calculation while processing a specific media format which was resulting in the crash.
*   This vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Android.
*   The fix involves patching the affected `tremolo` library.

**Summary**
CVE-2016-3756 is a denial of service vulnerability in the `tremolo` library used by Android's mediaserver. It occurs due to improper handling of specific media files that leads to memory corruption. An attacker can exploit this remotely through various means such as email, web browsing or MMS causing the target device to hang or reboot.
