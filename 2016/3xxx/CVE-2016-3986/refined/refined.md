        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by broken authenticode parsing within Avast.",
        "weaknesses": [

        "attack_vectors": [
          "The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted PE file.",
          "The malformed authenticode within the PE file is parsed by Avast, leading to the memory corruption."
