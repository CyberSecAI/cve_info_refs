I think it should be 600.  ---affected system--- Distro : ArchLinux Qt version : 5.5.1 (I'm sorry, I haven't check the other versions on Arch.) KDE version : 5.18.0 (The same as above) ------  ---not affected system--- Distro : Kubuntu 15.10 LiveCD Qt version : 5.4.2 KDE version : 5.15.0 ------    Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Just login to plasma5. (I tried sddm and startx.)  Actual Results:    The permission of /tmp/xauth-xxx-_y is 644.  Expected Results:   The permission of /tmp/xauth-xxx-_y should be 600.  I'm newbie but I tried to read the source for my study. I changed near the line 1536 of kinit-5.18.0/src/kdeinit/kinit.cpp. ---before--- if (!xauthfrom.open(QFile::ReadOnly) || !xauthfile.open(QFile::WriteOnly)     || xauthfile.write(xauthfrom.readAll()) != xauthfrom.size() || !xauthfile.commit()) { ------ to ---after--- if (!xauthfrom.open(QFile::ReadOnly) || !xauthfile.open(QFile::WriteOnly) || !xauthfile.setPermissions( QFile::Permissions( QFile::ReadOwner | QFile::WriteOwner ) )      || xauthfile.write(xauthfrom.readAll()) != xauthfrom.size() || !xauthfile.commit()) { ------  And remove /tmp/xauth-xxx-_y and relogin, then the permission become 600. I don't have enough ‎knowledge, so I can't determine this is valid solution or not. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=358593#c1)  Christoph Feck    2016-05-17 12:16:16 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 363140](show_bug.cgi?id=363140 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - World-readable X11 Cookie, easy key logger") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=358593#c2)  Albert Astals Cid    2016-05-17 21:33:43 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 363140](show_bug.cgi?id=363140 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - World-readable X11 Cookie, easy key logger") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=358593#c3)  Albert Astals Cid    2016-05-17 22:09:06 UTC  ``` Git commit dece8fd89979cd1a86c03bcaceef6e9221e8d8cd by Albert Astals Cid, on behalf of taro yamada.

The file is first created as world readable, and later chmod-ed to expected permissions, leaving a (small) window during which the file can be opened by anyone.  Also this looks like a symptom of a larger problem.  Previously, the xauth file was stored in the /tmp/kde-$username directory with safe permissions (700):  <https://userbase.kde.org/KDE_System_Administration/KDE_Filesystem_Hierarchy#Temporary_Files>  That directory does not seem to be created any more.  Other programs that previously created temporary files with world-readable permissions inside the safe directory may also be affected if they now use /tmp directly instead. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=358593#c5)  Albert Astals Cid    2016-05-19 22:06:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=358593#c4)) > Ain't this fix racy?  The file is first created as world readable, and later > chmod-ed to expected permissions, leaving a (small) window during which the > file can be opened by anyone.  Yes it is a bit racy, at this point it is the best mitigation *I* can offer, i am trying to get the people that know how this works to provide a better solution. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=358593#c6)  Albert Astals Cid    2016-05-21 16:04:31 UTC  ``` Fixed again with umask use ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=358593#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-23 08:46:11 UTC  ``` Adding the link to the umask fix, as it was not linked here automatically.  <https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kinit.git&a=commitdiff&h=72f3702dbe6cf15c06dc13da2c99c864e9022a58> ``` |  |

This has been tested on a F23 system with KDE / SDDM (with current patches) and a Arch Linux system with KDE / SDDM (plasma-desktop 5.6.4-1).   You are able to easily get the X11 cookie. $ sha256sum .Xauthority fcda4502b96b622e4b7a76bf0025731b596d8056b4471676e04241b6832798b8  .Xauthority  $ sha256sum /tmp/xauth-1000-_0 fcda4502b96b622e4b7a76bf0025731b596d8056b4471676e04241b6832798b8   /tmp/xauth-1000-_0  The cookie is world-readable, even if you change the permissions to the cookie, after a reboot the changes are gone. $ ls -l /tmp/xauth-1000-_0 -rw-r--r--. 1 sm sm 60 24. Feb 14:04 /tmp/xauth-1000-_0  I have another user that I log via the text console, after that you just need to start the typical X11 keylogger. $ cp /tmp/xauth-1000-_0 .Xauthority $ export DISPLAY=:0 $ xinput list |  grep -Po 'id=\K\d+(?=.*slave\s*keyboard)' |  xargs -P0 -n1 xinput test  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Login via the text console on any user. 2. Copy the X11 cookie over to .Xauthority file for the user you just logged into. $ cp /tmp/xauth-1000-_0 .Xauthority 3. Start the typical X11 keylogger. $ xinput list |  grep -Po 'id=\K\d+(?=.*slave\s*keyboard)' |  xargs -P0 -n1 xinput test  Actual Results:   After running the commands listed in "Steps to Reproduce" section, all the keyboard pushes are printed to the text console.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=983926#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2016-06-09 09:53:48 UTC  ``` via redhat bug rh#1344022  It was found that kdeinit5 creates /tmp/xauth-xxx-_y with inappropriate permission, which are 644 instead of 600. This can be exploited by stealing X11 cookie and running X11 keylogger. Malicious user is able to read key strokes of a different user which might be a sudo user. If attacker can log key events of a sudo user then it can lead to local privilege escalation.
