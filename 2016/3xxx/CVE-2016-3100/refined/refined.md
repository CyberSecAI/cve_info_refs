Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3100:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `kinit` component in KDE Frameworks creating the temporary Xauthority file (`/tmp/xauth-xxx-_y`) with insecure permissions (644) instead of the required 600.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the creation of the Xauthority file with world-readable permissions (644), which allows any local user to access its contents.
-   **Exposure of X11 Cookies:** The Xauthority file contains X11 cookies, which are authentication credentials for X server connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Keylogging:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the X11 cookies of other logged-in users. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on the keyboard input of those users using a keylogger.
-   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** If a user with elevated privileges (e.g., a `sudo` user) is targeted, the attacker could capture their keystrokes and potentially gain root access.
-   **Unauthorized Access:** By having the X11 cookie, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's X session and perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The attack is performed by a local user on the same system as the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the system.
-  **Ability to Read Files:** The attacker needs the ability to read files from the `/tmp` directory.
-   **Understanding of X11:** The attacker needs to understand how to use the X11 cookie with keylogger tools.

**Technical Details**

- The vulnerability is triggered because `kdeinit5` creates the `/tmp/xauth-xxx-_y` file with permissions of 644, when they should be 600.
- The Xauthority file contains authentication credentials that can be used to connect to an X server.
- By copying the Xauthority file, the attacker can monitor the keyboard input of other users.
- The vulnerability is fixed by setting the correct permissions on the Xauthority file.

**Additional Notes**

- The original fix involved setting the permissions after file creation, which was racy. A second fix using umask was implemented to prevent this race condition.
- The issue was initially reported against the kde-www product but was later moved to the frameworks-kinit product.
- The vulnerability is a duplicate of an older, similar bug with a more detailed description.
- The vulnerability affects KDE Frameworks versions prior to 5.23.
- The vulnerability impacts openSUSE Leap 42.1, openSUSE 13.2, and SUSE Package Hub for SLE 12.
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability does not affect SUSE products directly, however there are advisory for it.
