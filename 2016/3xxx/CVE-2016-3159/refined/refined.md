Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the incorrect handling of the FSW.ES bit (FPU Status Word Exception Summary bit) by Xen hypervisor when running on AMD CPUs. The hypervisor was relying on the value of this bit from the saved FPU context. AMD CPUs, however, calculate this bit based on pending exceptions and exception mask bits, ignoring explicit writes to it. This discrepancy led to the incorrect restoration of FPU state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leak: Due to the incorrect handling of the FSW.ES bit, the FPU instruction and data pointers (FIP/FDP) and opcode (FOP) could be leaked from one guest to another during context switches.
- Incorrect FPU state restoration: The hypervisor's incorrect behavior could also potentially result in unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Address Space Leakage: A malicious guest could obtain information about another domain's address space usage.
- Timing Information Leak: The vulnerability allows for the extraction of timing information about other domains.
- Covert Channel Creation: The information leak can be used as a low-bandwidth covert channel to gain information about the operation of the target guest
- Potential for Defeating ASLR: The leaked address space information could assist in defeating address space randomization.
- While it is considered unlikely, the possibility of the leak directly compromising sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys, cannot be completely ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Guest Domain: A malicious guest domain can exploit this vulnerability.
- FPU context switches: The vulnerability arises during FPU context switches between different guest domains.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Guest Access: The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a guest domain that runs on the affected hypervisor (Xen on AMD x86 systems).
- Understanding FPU state and timing behavior to analyze leaks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is specifically related to the `fpu_fxrstor` function, and must be combined with a fix to the `xrstor` function which is related to CVE-2016-3158.
*   The vulnerability is specific to AMD x86 systems and does not affect Intel or ARM systems. Both PV and HVM guests are affected.
*   The advisory provides patches to resolve this issue for multiple Xen versions (4.0 onwards).
