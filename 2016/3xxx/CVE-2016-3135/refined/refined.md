  "CVE-2016-3135": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the Linux netfilter implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.",
    "affected_component": "Linux kernel netfilter implementation",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `xt_alloc_table_info` function when allocating memory for netfilter table info structures on 32-bit systems. This could lead to allocating a smaller-than-expected structure and cause a heap overflow via copy_from_user.",
    "vulnerability": "Integer overflow leading to heap corruption",
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash), potentially arbitrary code execution with administrative privileges on 32-bit systems.",
    "attack_vector": "Local",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in the `xt_alloc_table_info` function. The size calculation `sizeof(*info) + size` is vulnerable to integer overflow which causes a small structure allocation which is then overflowed via `copy_from_user` during the table info creation. This was fixed by adding a check to see if the calculated size `sz` is less than the size of `*info`."
