# USN-3054-1: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)

* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial/4.4.0-34.53~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)

* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial/4.4.0-34.53~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-34.53)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-34.53)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-34.53)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-34.53)

  -
  [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-34.53)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-34.53)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-34.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

netfilter: x\_tables: check for size overflowBen Hawkes says:
integer overflow in xt\_alloc\_table\_info, which on 32-bit systems can
lead to small structure allocation and a copy\_from\_user based heap

# USN-3057-1: Linux kernel (Qualcomm Snapdragon) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon Processors

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu

allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](/security/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1022-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon)
  -
  [4.4.0-1022.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1022.25)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1027-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1027.35](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1027.35)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Ben Hawkes says:
 integer overflow in xt_alloc_table_info, which on 32-bit systems can
 lead to small structure allocation and a copy_from_user based heap
 corruption.

## Packages

* [linux-lts-wily](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-wily) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
