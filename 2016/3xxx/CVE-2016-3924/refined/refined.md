Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper parameter checking when handling the `EFFEC_CMD_SET_PARAM` command within the Mediaserver component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is the missing or inadequate parameter validation, which allows for the passing of potentially malicious or out-of-bounds parameters to the `EFFEC_CMD_SET_PARAM` command.
- **Information Disclosure:** The insufficient input validation leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious application could leverage this vulnerability to access sensitive information that it should not normally have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector is a local malicious application. This means the attacker needs to have already installed a malicious application on the target device.
- **Exploiting the EFFEC_CMD_SET_PARAM Command:** The malicious app would need to craft a specific request to the Mediaserver, using the vulnerable `EFFEC_CMD_SET_PARAM` command with crafted parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to install and execute code on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message mentions "Add EFFEC_CMD_SET_PARAM parameter checking". This indicates that the fix was to implement proper input validation for parameters used with this command.
- The CVE description from the Android Security Bulletin states this is a "Information disclosure vulnerability in Mediaserver".
- The severity is rated as "Moderate" because while it allows for data access without permission, it is not a critical system compromise.
