# Specially crafted wav file causing a buffer overflow in vlc

### Bug Description

Hi,

We found a buffer overflow in the parsing and processing of wav files in VLC (version 2.1.6-0). It was tested in Ubuntu 14.04 (x86\_64), but it will probably affects other versions as well. Find attached a test case to reproduce it. Here you can see the gdb stack trace:

It is evident that the memcpy operation has an abnormally large size parameter (4290773038). It shouldn't be difficult to exploit this bug to obtain arbitrary memory execution overwriting some function pointer.

Regards,

Gustavo.

I just tested it with a recent git version of vlc (3.0.0-git) and it wasn't crashing or anything (i used valgrind).

vlc is in universe, which means it's community maintained.

If you would like to see an update to the vlc package in Ubuntu, you need to submit a debdiff to fix this issue. When a debdiff is available, members of the security team will review it and publish the package. See the following link for more information: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures>

I see. Unfortunately, i have no experience in the vlc source code. In any case, is it possible to make this issue public so someone else can fix it ? (probably using oss-security)

Fixed since 321fa90d585b9ebcb317cf6e575edf2bb952b687 in the 2.2 branch, which was included in 2.2.0-1. All 2.1.x release are affected though.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=984382#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-06-13 08:40:12 UTC  ``` <http://www.videolan.org/security/sa1601.html>  Security Advisory 1601  Summary           : Buffer Overflow in Processing QuickTime IMA Files Date              : June 2016 Affected versions : VLC media player 2.2.3 and earlier ID                : VideoLAN-SA-1601 CVE reference     : CVE-2016-5108  Details  A remote user can create a specially crafted QuickTime IMA file that, when loaded by the target user, will trigger a buffer overflow in DecodeAdpcmImaQT() in 'modules/codec/adpcm.c'. Impact  If successful, a malicious third party could trigger either a crash of VLC or an arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the target user.  Threat mitigation: Exploitation of those issues requires the user to explicitly open a specially crafted file or stream.  ASLR and DEP help reduce exposure, but may be bypassed.  Workarounds: The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties or accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins), until the patch is applied.  Solution: VLC media player 2.2.4 addresses the issue. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=984382#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2016-06-13 08:42:24 UTC  ``` <https://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/vlc-2.2.git;a=commit;h=c2d2c3698e47402ec36ecc6c8a85781dbd88b6a9> from <https://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commit;h=458ed62bbeb9d1bddf7b8df104e14936408a3db9>  From c2d2c3698e47402ec36ecc6c8a85781dbd88b6a9 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: =?utf8?q?Rafa=C3=ABl=20Carr=C3=A9?= <funman@videolan.org> Date: Wed, 25 May 2016 10:00:25 +0200 Subject: [PATCH] adpcm: reject invalid QuickTime IMA files  DecodeAdpcmImaQT() can only decode up to stereo files.
