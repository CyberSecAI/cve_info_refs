Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3941:

**CVE-2016-3941**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `AStreamPeekStream` function within `input/stream.c` of VideoLAN VLC media player. This occurs due to improper handling of seek operations across the end of a file (EOF) when processing a crafted WAV file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, a crafted WAV file can cause `memcpy` to write beyond the allocated buffer. The issue arises during the stream parsing/seeking logic, leading to an incorrect size calculation for a `memcpy` operation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (crash) or, potentially, arbitrary code execution. The large `memcpy` size can overwrite heap memory, potentially corrupting data or overwriting function pointers which could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted WAV file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted WAV file that, when opened by a vulnerable VLC media player, will trigger the overflow. User interaction is required to open the malicious file.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The `AStreamPeekStream` function does not correctly handle the case where a seek operation goes beyond the end of the file and attempts to read data beyond the available buffer, causing the overflow.
    *   A patch was made available in commit `321fa90d585b9ebcb317cf6e575edf2bb952b687`, which was included in VLC 2.2.0-1 and later versions. This patch ensures that the `AStreamPeekStream` function handles EOF conditions correctly.

**Summary of patches and affected versions based on provided data:**
*   VLC versions prior to 2.2.0 are vulnerable.
*   The patch was introduced in commit `321fa90d585b9ebcb317cf6e575edf2bb952b687` and is included in VLC version 2.2.0 and later.
*   openSUSE 13.2 was updated to `vlc-2.1.6-2.10.1` to address this vulnerability.
*   openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed were not affected as they included fixed versions of VLC.

**CVE-2016-5108**

* **Root Cause**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `DecodeAdpcmImaQT` function in `modules/codec/adpcm.c` of VLC media player. This is caused by processing a specially crafted QuickTime IMA file with more than two channels (stereo).
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The `DecodeAdpcmImaQT` function does not properly check for the number of channels in the input QuickTime IMA file. If more than two channels are present, the code attempts to write out-of-bounds resulting in a buffer overflow.
* **Impact of Exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted QuickTime IMA file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted QuickTime IMA file, which when opened by a vulnerable VLC media player, will trigger the overflow.
*   **Additional Details:** The fix for this vulnerability, prevents decoding of QuickTime IMA files with more than two channels.

**Summary of patches and affected versions based on provided data:**
* Vulnerable versions: VLC media player 2.2.3 and earlier
* Fixed Version: VLC 2.2.4 and later
* openSUSE-SU-2016:1651-1 and openSUSE-SU-2016:1652-1 addressed this vulnerability
