{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ANQP (Access Network Query Protocol) element parsing code, which processes untrusted data broadcasted by access points, lacks proper error handling and could lead to exceptions (e.g., null pointer exceptions) that crash the system service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient error handling in ANQP element parsing code.",
      "Parsing of untrusted data without proper validation."
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service vulnerability in the Wi-Fi service could enable a local malicious application to prevent Wi-Fi calling.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious application can exploit the lack of error handling in the ANQP element parsing code by providing crafted data broadcasted by an access point.",
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious local application with the ability to influence the ANQP data broadcasted by an access point."
