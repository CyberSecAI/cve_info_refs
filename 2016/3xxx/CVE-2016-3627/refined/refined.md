CVE Description: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

===CONTENT to ANALYZE===
```
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3627:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper recursion depth tracking in the `xmlParserEntityCheck` and `xmlParseAttValueComplex` functions (or `xmlStringGetNodeList` when used in recovery mode) within libxml2. These functions, when handling nested entity references or processing malformed XML documents in recovery mode, failed to account for the level of recursion, leading to uncontrolled stack growth.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper recursion depth tracking
- Missing limits on nested entity references
- Vulnerable code paths in both normal and recovery mode parsing

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the lack of recursion limits with a crafted XML document with deeply nested entities, attackers can force the affected application to consume excessive stack space, leading to a crash and DoS.
- **Application Crash:** The excessive stack usage leads to an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted XML documents:** The attack vector involves feeding a specially crafted XML file with a large number of nested entity references or malformed structures to an application using libxml2.
- **Context-dependent:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any context that parses untrusted XML data with libxml2. Applications that operate in recovery mode are particularly at risk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted XML document to an application using a vulnerable version of libxml2. This could be achieved through network connections, file uploads, etc.
- No specific privileges or authentication is needed

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the parser's inability to manage recursion depth properly, particularly when recovering from errors.
- Some sources indicate that this CVE may be a duplicate of CVE-2016-4483. This however is not the case. The root cause in the stack overflow is different from the out-of-bounds read that happens in CVE-2016-4483.
- The fix involves proper incrementing and decrementing the recursion depth counter in the vulnerable functions, which can be seen in the attached patch example from one source
- The provided patch for CVE-2016-3627 limits `xmlStringGetNodeList` to 1024 recursions to avoid the stack exhaustion.
- It affects applications parsing untrusted XML documents or that use recovery mode when parsing such documents.

The information indicates that the core vulnerability in libxml2 allows for a relatively simple method to induce a DoS. The multiple references provided also include various vendor-specific fixes and vulnerability reports.
