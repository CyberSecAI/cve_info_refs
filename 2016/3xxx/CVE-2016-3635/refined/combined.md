- Authentication Required: Yes

4. Affected Components Description
==================================
In SAP, the Remote Function Modules (RFM) are used to execute remote functions in external systems, where the access
control can be enforced by a list that is managed through the Unified Connectivity (UCON) framework.

5. Vulnerability Details
========================
An authenticated user could execute Remote Function Modules (RFM) which are filtered by the Unified Connectivity (UCON)
access control list. Those RFMs are in the final phase of UCON implementation and not included in a Communication
Assembly (CA). That means that no user (regardless its privileges) should be able to execute those RFMs.

The user needs to remotely execute an anonymous RFM included in a Communication Assembly (enabled by UCON), and by
leveraging the same connection execute a second RFM which is filtered (not included in a Communication Assembly).
As result, the user will be able to execute a RFM that was originally filtered by UCON, completely bypassing the access
control list.

6. Solution
===========
Implement SAP Security Note 2139366.
