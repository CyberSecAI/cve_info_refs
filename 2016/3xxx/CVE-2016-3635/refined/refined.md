Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3635:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the SAP Netweaver UCON (Unified Connectivity) framework. Specifically, it lies in how UCON filters and manages access to Remote Function Modules (RFMs).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that UCON's access control list can be bypassed.
*   **Bypass of UCON filtering:** Authenticated users can execute RFMs that are explicitly filtered by UCON. These are RFMs that are not included in a Communication Assembly (CA) and should not be executable by any user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Security Protections:** An attacker can circumvent security measures implemented within SAP systems.
*   **Arbitrary Business Process Execution:**  Successful exploitation enables the attacker to potentially execute unauthorized business processes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Chained RFM Execution:** The attack requires a two-step process:
    1.  Executing an anonymous RFM that *is* part of a Communication Assembly (and thus allowed by UCON)
    2.  Leveraging the existing connection to execute a second RFM that is *not* part of a Communication Assembly and should be blocked by UCON.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the SAP system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to remotely access the SAP system to initiate the attack.

**Additional details:**

*   **Affected Components:** SAP Netweaver 7.4
*   **Vendor CVSS v2 Score:** 6.0 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)
