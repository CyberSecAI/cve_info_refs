{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SAP Download Manager stores sensitive data, such as proxy usernames and passwords, in a configuration file using weak encryption. The encryption key is either composed of the computer's BIOS serial number concatenated with a hardcoded string or, on other platforms, just a hardcoded string. Additionally, a transformation is performed on the value to be encrypted/decrypted.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Weak encryption algorithm using a static key",
    "Insecure storage of sensitive information",
	"Use of hardcoded keys"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who gains access to a user's configuration file can decrypt and obtain the stored proxy password and potentially other sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the user's configuration file is required.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have access to the local file system where the SAP Download Manager configuration file is stored."
