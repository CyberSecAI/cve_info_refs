  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `pulp-gen-nodes-certificate` script created a temporary directory using `/tmp/$RANDOM`, which is predictable and insecure. This allowed an attacker to create a symbolic link at the same path and potentially write to arbitrary files or leak private keys.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Symlink attack vulnerability",
      "Predictable temporary directory path"
    ],

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local symlink attack",
