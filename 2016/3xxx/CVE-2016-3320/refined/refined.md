**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Windows Secure Boot improperly loading a boot manager that is affected by the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the Secure Boot mechanism by installing a vulnerable boot manager.
- **Code Integrity Check Disablement:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to disable code integrity checks, enabling the loading of test-signed executables and drivers.
- **BitLocker/Device Encryption Bypass:** Secure Boot integrity validation for BitLocker and Device Encryption security features can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can load unsigned or malicious executables and drivers, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- Sensitive data protected by BitLocker or device encryption could be accessed without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the target device can install a malicious boot manager.
- **Administrative Privileges:** An attacker who has gained administrative privileges on a system can also install a vulnerable boot manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs physical access or administrative access to the target system to install the affected boot manager.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by blacklisting the affected boot managers.
*   The provided text also mentions a workaround for mitigating the issue using BitLocker with a TPM + PIN protection, and another for disabling Secure Boot integrity protection of BitLocker.
