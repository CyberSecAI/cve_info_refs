- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default account lockout setting in IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile is inadequate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate account lockout mechanism, which allows brute force attacks against user accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can use brute force to discover account credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges required, the attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
