- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sanitycheck` module in SimpleSAMLphp leaks information about the PHP version used by the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information leakage vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can obtain the exact PHP version running on the server. This information can then be used to search for vulnerabilities specific to that version of PHP, which can be used to perform further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker can access the `sanitycheck` module to obtain the leaked information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `sanitycheck` module of the SimpleSAMLphp installation.
