Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-3356:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A remote code execution vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects in memory by GDI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- An attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer user rights are less impacted than those with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited in multiple ways:
  - **Web-based attack**: The attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then lures the user to visit the malicious website.
  - **File-sharing attack**: The attacker provides a specially crafted document file designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then persuades the user to open the malicious document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious document.
- The attacker does not need to be logged into the system for a web-based attack.
- For a file-sharing attack, the attacker must deliver the malicious file to the user.
