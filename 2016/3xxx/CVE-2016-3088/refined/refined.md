Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-3088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `fileserver` web service within Apache ActiveMQ. This service allows for file uploads and manipulation through HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The `fileserver` web application does not properly restrict file uploads. An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious code, to the server by sending a crafted HTTP PUT request.
*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:**  Using a specially crafted HTTP MOVE request following the PUT request, an attacker can move the uploaded file to a different location on the server, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones in arbitrary locations.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious JSP or JAR file and subsequently executing it, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. This is achieved through the combination of arbitrary file upload and file move, allowing the attacker to plant a webshell on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server within the context of the ActiveMQ process. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **System Takeover:**  Full control of the server and its resources can be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The primary attack vector involves sending HTTP PUT and MOVE requests to the vulnerable `fileserver` web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Apache ActiveMQ server.
*   **No Authentication (Potentially):** Depending on the configuration of the ActiveMQ instance, authentication might not be required to exploit the vulnerability, which further increases the risk.
*   **HTTP knowledge**: The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft HTTP PUT and MOVE requests.
*   **Webshell Creation**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious JSP or JAR payload that will execute on the server.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by removing the fileserver functionality in ActiveMQ version 5.14.0 and later.
*   The vulnerability is similar to one reported in CVE-2015-1830.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Simon Zuckerbraun and Andrea Micalizzi (rgod) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.

The provided content from exploit-db.com confirms the exploit using HTTP PUT and MOVE requests to upload a JSP webshell. It also highlights that the vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code in the context of the ActiveMQ service.
