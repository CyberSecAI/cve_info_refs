Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-3842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm GPU driver. This vulnerability could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core issue is that the Qualcomm GPU driver has a flaw that enables a local application to gain unauthorized kernel-level code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to a local, permanent device compromise. This might require reflashing the operating system to repair the device, which can result in significant loss of data and device usability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A local malicious application is the attack vector, meaning the attacker needs to have an app installed on the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the targeted device.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious application which triggers the vulnerability in the Qualcomm GPU driver.

**Additional Details:**

*   The patch for this issue is not publicly available. The update is contained in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the Google Developer site.
*   The vulnerability affects Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, and Nexus 6P devices.
*   The issue is identified by Qualcomm reference QC-CR#1002974.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to the potential of achieving permanent device compromise through kernel level code execution.
