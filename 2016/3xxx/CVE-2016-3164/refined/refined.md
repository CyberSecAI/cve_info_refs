Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3164:

**Summary:** CVE-2016-3164 is an open redirect vulnerability affecting Drupal versions 6, 7, and 8. It arises from improper handling of external URLs within the path, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Drupal handles the current path, allowing it to be populated with an external URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The core vulnerability is that the system allows redirection to an arbitrary URL controlled by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Redirection:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website. This can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Path Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious external URL embedded in the path.
- **404 Page Interaction:** In certain cases, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a special URL and submitting a form shown on a 404 error page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- In some cases, the attacker may need to be able to submit a form on the site.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it would only occur in combination with custom code, or in certain cases if a user submits a form shown on a 404 page with a specially crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is considered moderately critical by Drupal.
- Drupal 8 was hardened against browser flaws handling certain redirect paths in response to this vulnerability.
- The provided content does not specify the exact vulnerable code location within Drupal, but rather describes the behavior that leads to the open redirect.
