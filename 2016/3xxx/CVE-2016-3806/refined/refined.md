Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the MediaTek display driver. The specific nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free, etc.) is not described in detail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Kernel:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute any code they choose with kernel-level privileges.
*   **Local Permanent Device Compromise:** This could lead to a permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious app installed on the device can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a malicious application running on the target device.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker leverages the vulnerability in the display driver to escalate their privileges to kernel level.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The patch for this issue is not publicly available and is included in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices.
*   The vulnerability is specific to devices using MediaTek display drivers, in this case, Android One devices.
*   The vulnerability is rated as High severity because it requires compromising a privileged process.

In summary, CVE-2016-3806 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the MediaTek display driver that could be exploited by a local malicious application to gain kernel-level code execution, potentially leading to a permanent device compromise.
