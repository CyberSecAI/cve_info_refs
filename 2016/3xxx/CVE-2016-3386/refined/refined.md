- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption in the Chakra JavaScript engine when handling objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user has administrative privileges, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**:  A specially crafted website or an application/Office document hosting the Edge rendering engine could be used to trigger the vulnerability when viewed by the target user. Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content can also be used to deliver the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to host or inject the malicious content into a site that a user will visit using Microsoft Edge, or embed the malicious content into a document that is opened using software that hosts the Edge rendering engine.
