{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `close_all_sockets` function was incorrectly assuming that all registered local sockets use `local_socket_close` as their close function. However, this is not true for JDWP sockets.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect assumption about socket close function leading to potential issues when closing JDWP sockets",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability could lead to a local elevation of privilege. A local malicious application could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of an elevated system application due to issues with the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP).",
  "Attack vectors": "Local malicious application exploiting the JDWP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a local malicious application installed on the device, and the device must have an uncommon configuration.",
    "Additional Information": "The fix involves using the socket's own close function when closing, and switching the socket list mutex to a recursive mutex to avoid potential deadlocks"
