Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3374:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the Microsoft Windows PDF Library handles objects in memory. Specifically, the library contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the PostScript calculator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is that the PDF library reads data beyond the allocated memory boundaries.
- **Information Disclosure:** This out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive memory information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the memory space of the process handling the PDF file. This could be used to further compromise the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted PDF files:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating malicious PDF files designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- **Web-based attacks:** Attackers can host these malicious PDF files on websites, luring users into viewing them with Microsoft Edge or other vulnerable PDF viewers, or use compromised websites to host the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create or host malicious PDF files:** The attacker must be able to create or acquire a specially crafted PDF file.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious PDF file through a vulnerable application, like Microsoft Edge or other PDF viewers.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the PostScript calculator of the Microsoft Windows PDF library.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in the MS16-115 security update.
- The update corrects how certain functions handle objects in memory.

This information aligns with the details provided in the blog post and the Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS16-115), particularly the description of the vulnerability and its impact.
