Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3992:

**Root Cause:**

- The `cronic` script used predictable temporary file names based solely on the process ID (PID). Specifically, it created files like `/tmp/cronic.out.$$`, `/tmp/cronic.err.$$`, and `/tmp/cronic.trace.$$` where `$$` is replaced with the script's PID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The use of the PID to generate temporary file names makes them easily predictable.
- **Lack of Secure Temporary File Creation:** The script does not use secure methods for creating temporary files like `mktemp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to a target file (e.g. `/etc/fstab`) before the cronic script creates the temporary files. When `cronic` attempts to write to its temporary file, it would actually write to the attacker's target file, leading to arbitrary file write access.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If `cronic` is executed with elevated privileges (e.g., by a cron job running as root), the attacker could potentially overwrite system files, leading to privilege escalation and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack is local and can be performed by a user on the same system as the vulnerable `cronic` script.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to create a symlink with the predictable temporary filename (e.g., `/tmp/cronic.out.12345`) before cronic is executed with the same PID, pointing to the target file that the attacker wants to modify.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to predict the PID of the cronic process and create the symlink before the cronic script executes. However, this is usually easy to accomplish.
- **Knowledge of cronic Usage:** The attacker needs to know how `cronic` is used and the temporary files it creates.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in `cronic` version 3, which uses `mktemp` to create secure temporary files.
- The issue was initially reported in Debian bug #820331.
- The CVE was assigned after the report.
