- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of the origin and integrity of code before processing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system processes patches, image backups, and other updates without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of the code. This is a code integrity vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker could load and execute malicious code on the affected systems.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to be able to upload or apply patches, image backups, or other updates to the IBM Security Access Manager appliances.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload and apply code updates.
