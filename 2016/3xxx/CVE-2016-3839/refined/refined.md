      "content": "The provided text from source.android.com describes CVE-2016-3839 as a denial of service vulnerability in Bluetooth. A local malicious application could prevent 911 calls from a Bluetooth device. \n\nRoot cause: The vulnerability is triggered by delivering a signal to the Bluetooth process that causes a denial-of-service condition.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: The vulnerability lies in the handling of signals within the Bluetooth process, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service.\n\nImpact of exploitation: A successful exploit would prevent a user from making 911 emergency calls using a Bluetooth device.\n\nAttack vectors: A local malicious application is required to trigger the vulnerability by sending specific signals to the Bluetooth process.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. No special permissions beyond a local application is required.  \n\nThe provided commit messages from android.googlesource.com confirm that the issue is related to a potential DoS caused by delivering a signal to the BT process.\n\nAdditional Information: The advisory states that this is a 'Moderate' severity issue. The fix is described in the commit as \"Fix potential DoS caused by delivering signal to BT process\"",
