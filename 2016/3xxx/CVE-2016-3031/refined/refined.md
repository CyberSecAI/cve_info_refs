- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in IBM Cognos Analytics, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session. This can potentially lead to credentials disclosure and alteration of the intended functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a user embedding malicious JavaScript code within the IBM Cognos Analytics web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the IBM Cognos Analytics application and must have the ability to embed JavaScript code within the web UI. The user also needs to entice another user to interact with the malicious code.
