```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists because Kerberos improperly handles a password change request and falls back to NTLM as the default authentication protocol.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Security Feature Bypass, Improper handling of password change requests by Kerberos, fallback to NTLM authentication.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could bypass Kerberos authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources.
  - Attack vectors: Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack against traffic between a domain controller and the target machine.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between a domain controller and a target machine, perform a MiTM attack.
