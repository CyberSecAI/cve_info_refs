- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of large log streams with malformed UTF-8 sequences. Diego breaks up log streams on UTF-8 boundaries, but when encountering malformed sequences, it can lead to a denial-of-service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation and handling of malformed UTF-8 data when processing application logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS) on a Cloud Foundry installation.
- **Attack vectors:** An application outputting malformed UTF-8 sequences to its logs can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to control the application outputting logs on the affected Cloud Foundry deployment.
