Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-3360:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer rights are less impacted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office.
- Email attack: sending a malicious file and convincing the user to open it.
- Web-based attack: hosting a website with a malicious file or leveraging a compromised website, then convincing the user to visit the site and open the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted file that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the file, either via email or by directing them to a website.
- No specific user privileges on the system are required for the initial exploit, but administrative rights on the targeted system would allow full control.
