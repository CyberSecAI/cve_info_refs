The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2016-3364. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2016-3364:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Office software improperly handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take full control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full rights.
- Users with fewer rights are less impacted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted file: The user must open a malicious file using vulnerable Microsoft Office software.
  - Email attack: The attacker sends the malicious file via email and convinces the user to open it.
  - Web-based attack: The attacker hosts the malicious file on a website (or uses a compromised website), and convinces the user to visit the site and open the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted file that exploits the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file. This could be achieved through social engineering techniques like phishing via email or instant messaging, or by tricking them into visiting a website.
