{
  "CVE-2016-3136": {
    "Description": "The mct_u232_msr_to_state function in drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted USB device without two interrupt-in endpoint descriptors.",
    "Root cause": "The `mct_u232` driver in the Linux kernel does not validate the number of interrupt-in endpoint descriptors before accessing them, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when a crafted USB device lacking the expected number of endpoints is connected.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of USB device descriptors.",
       "Lack of a sanity check for the number of interrupt-in endpoint descriptors before dereferencing them."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system crash) due to NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Attack vectors": "Physically proximate attackers can connect a crafted USB device to a vulnerable system.",
    "Required capabilities": "Physical access to the vulnerable system to connect the crafted USB device."
