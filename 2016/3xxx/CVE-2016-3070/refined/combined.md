# USN-3037-1: Linux kernel (Vivid HWE) vulnerability

14 July 2016

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid for Trusty

## Details

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel's memory manager did not

properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring

buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

The trace\_writeback\_dirty\_page implementation in
include/trace/events/writeback.h in the Linux kernel before 4.4 improperly
interacts with mm/migrate.c, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact by triggering a certain page move.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel's memory manager did not
properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring
buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash).

# USN-3034-1: Linux kernel vulnerability

14 July 2016

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel's memory manager did not

properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring

buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# USN-3034-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerability

14 July 2016

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

USN-3034-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 LTS.

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel's memory manager did not

properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring

buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash).

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-92-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-92.139~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-92.139~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-92-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-92.139~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-92.139~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3035-1: Linux kernel vulnerability

14 July 2016

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel's memory manager did not

properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring

buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

  -
  [4.2.0-42.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-42.49)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

A local attacker could abuse concurrent access to the socket options to escalate their privileges, or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) via a crafted sendmsg system call. (CVE-2016-3841, Important)
* Several Moderate and Low impact security issues were found in the Linux kernel. Space precludes documenting each of these issues in this advisory. Refer to the CVE links in the References section for a description of each of these vulnerabilities. (CVE-2013-4312, CVE-2015-8374, CVE-2015-8543, CVE-2015-8812, CVE-2015-8844, CVE-2015-8845, CVE-2016-2053, CVE-2016-2069, CVE-2016-2847, CVE-2016-3156, CVE-2016-4581, CVE-2016-4794, CVE-2016-5412, CVE-2016-5828, CVE-2016-5829, CVE-2016-6136, CVE-2016-6198, CVE-2016-6327, CVE-2016-6480, CVE-2015-8746, CVE-2015-8956, CVE-2016-2117, CVE-2016-2384, CVE-2016-3070, CVE-2016-3699, CVE-2016-4569, CVE-2016-4578)

# USN-3036-1: Linux kernel (Utopic HWE) vulnerability

14 July 2016

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic for Trusty

## Details

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel's memory manager did not

properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring

buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash).

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-3.16.0-77-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-utopic)
  -
  [3.16.0-77.99~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-utopic/3.16.0-77.99~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

There's mention of another bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1306851> which should even have a reproducer, but that wants a login some access privileges. Do we have such account on RH bugzilla?  - affected kernels should be SLE12 and SLE12-SP1  - based on the scarce information, it seems the problem is when account_page_dirtied() is called with a mapping where mapping->backing_dev_info->dev is NULL, and the writeback_dirty_page tracepoint is enabled. Then trace_writeback_dirty_page() will try to extract name of the dev via dev_name(mapping->backing_dev_info->dev). dev_name() doesn't expect dev to be NULL and dereferences dev->init_name.  - RH bug mentions aio_fs_backing_dev_info, but it seems there are few more bdi types that have the following properties:   - no bdi.dev assigned, thus NULL   - bdi.capabilities includes BDI_CAP_NO_ACCT_AND_WRITEBACK which means no dirty page accounting and no page writeback   - mapping->a_ops->set_page_dirty is set to e.g. __set_page_dirty_no_writeback or some other implementation, that doesn't call account_page_dirtied() (i.e. not __set_page_dirty_nobuffers)  - This means account_page_dirtied() shouldn't be called for pages with such mapping->bdi.  - migrate_page_copy() breaks this assumption by calling __set_page_dirty_nobuffers(newpage), thus account_page_dirtied()  How to fix this?  - upstream commit <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=42cb14b110a5698ccf26ce59c4441722605a3743> has fixed this just accidentally, changelog says "No actual problems seen with this procedure recently". It does seem like the best long-term fix, as it fixes migrate_page_copy() doing some arbitrary fixups that are different from a_ops->set_page_dirty. But the patch is part of 12-patch series and could be a risk to backport even if it turns out to be stand-alone.  - we could patch account_page_dirtied() to only call the tracepoint inside the "if (mapping_cap_account_dirty(mapping))" branch, which will exclude bdi's with BDI_CAP_NO_ACCT_AND_WRITEBACK. Upstream might not accept such patch without an actual upstream problem, but we might argue that it doesn't make sense to trace events that actually do nothing.  - we could patch the tracepoint to be more careful and check dev != NULL first. Upstream might see this as pointless overhead.  Michal, what do you think? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=979215#c6)  Vlastimil Babka   2017-03-06 07:57:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vlastimil Babka from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=979215#c5)) > - upstream commit > <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/> > ?id=42cb14b110a5698ccf26ce59c4441722605a3743 has fixed this just > accidentally, changelog says "No actual problems seen with this procedure > recently".

Ah, it seems the commit was later backported to stable kernels including 3.12, so SLE12-SP1 has it since August. So I guess we just apply the same to SLE12-LTSS, unless the CVE score / priority is below LTSS threshold or something? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=979215#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2017-05-11 19:14:30 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2017:1247-1: An update that solves 25 vulnerabilities and has 10 fixes is now available.

# USN-3035-2: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerability

14 July 2016

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel's memory manager did not

properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring

buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash).

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1034-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1034.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1034.44)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2016-5244

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-7515, CVE-2016-2184, CVE-2016-2185, CVE-2016-2186,
CVE-2016-2187, CVE-2016-3136, CVE-2016-3137, CVE-2016-3138,
CVE-2016-3140

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that various USB
    drivers do not sufficiently validate USB descriptors.  This
    allowed a physically present user with a specially designed USB
    device to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2016-0821

    Solar Designer noted that the list 'poisoning' feature, intended
    to mitigate the effects of bugs in list manipulation in the
    kernel, used poison values within the range of virtual addresses
    that can be allocated by user processes.

CVE-2016-1237

    David Sinquin discovered that nfsd does not check permissions when
    setting ACLs, allowing users to grant themselves permissions to a
    file by setting the ACL.

CVE-2016-1583

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that the eCryptfs
    filesystem could be used together with the proc filesystem to
    cause a kernel stack overflow.  If the ecryptfs-utils package is
    installed, local users could exploit this, via the
    mount.ecryptfs_private program, for denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2117

    Justin Yackoski of Cryptonite discovered that the Atheros L2
    ethernet driver incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote
    attacker could take advantage of this flaw to obtain potentially
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2016-2143

    Marcin Koscielnicki discovered that the fork implementation in the
    Linux kernel on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four
    page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

CVE-2016-3070

    Jan Stancek of Red Hat discovered a local denial of service
    vulnerability in AIO handling.

CVE-2016-3134

    The Google Project Zero team found that the netfilter subsystem does
    not sufficiently validate filter table entries. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this for denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. Debian disables
    unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled with the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this allows privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-3156

    Solar Designer discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux
    kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects
    properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial
    of service (networking outage) in the host OS.

CVE-2016-3157 / XSA-171

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the x86_64 (amd64) task switching
    implementation did not correctly update the I/O permission level
    when running as a Xen paravirtual (PV) guest.  In some
    configurations this would allow local users to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2016-3672

    Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll noted that it was possible to disable
    Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) for x86_32 (i386) programs
    by removing the stack resource limit. This made it easier for local
    users to exploit security flaws in programs that have the setuid or
    setgid flag set.

CVE-2016-3951

    It was discovered that the cdc_ncm driver would free memory
    prematurely if certain errors occurred during its initialisation.
    This allowed a physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    escalate their privileges.

CVE-2016-3955

    Ignat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check
    the length of data received for a USB buffer.  This allowed denial
    of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured
    as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to
    impersonate it over the network.  A system configured as a usbip
    server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.

CVE-2016-3961 / XSA-174

    Vitaly Kuznetsov of Red Hat discovered that Linux allowed the use of
    hugetlbfs on x86 (i386 and amd64) systems even when running as a Xen
    paravirtualised (PV) guest, although Xen does not support huge
    pages. This allowed users with access to /dev/hugepages to cause a
    denial of service (crash) in the guest.

CVE-2016-4470

    David Howells of Red Hat discovered that a local user can trigger a
    flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of key lookups in the keychain
    subsystem, leading to a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-4482, CVE-2016-4485, CVE-2016-4486, CVE-2016-4569,
CVE-2016-4578, CVE-2016-4580, CVE-2016-5243, CVE-2016-5244

    Kangjie Lu reported that the USB devio, llc, rtnetlink, ALSA
    timer, x25, tipc, and rds facilities leaked information from the
    kernel stack.

CVE-2016-4565

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that various components
    in the InfiniBand stack implemented unusual semantics for the
    write() operation.  On a system with InfiniBand drivers loaded,
    local users could use this for denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-4581

    Tycho Andersen discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel
    did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local user can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2016-4805

    Baozeng Ding discovered a use-after-free in the generic PPP layer in
    the Linux kernel. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service (system crash), or potentially escalate
    their privileges.

CVE-2016-4913

    Al Viro found that the ISO9660 filesystem implementation did not
    correctly count the length of certain invalid name entries.
    Reading a directory containing such name entries would leak
    information from kernel memory.  Users permitted to mount disks or
    disk images could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2016-4997 / CVE-2016-4998

    Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that missing input sanitising
    in Netfilter socket handling may result in denial of service. Debian
    disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled
    with the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this also allows
    privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# CVE-2016-3070

| **Name** | CVE-2016-3070 |

| **Description** | The trace\_writeback\_dirty\_page implementation in include/trace/events/writeback.h in the Linux kernel before 4.4 improperly interacts with mm/migrate.c, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a certain page move. |

mm: migrate dirty page without clear\_page\_dirty\_for\_io etc

```
clear_page_dirty_for_io() has accumulated writeback and memcg subtleties
since v2.6.16 first introduced page migration; and the set_page_dirty()
which completed its migration of PageDirty, later had to be moderated to
__set_page_dirty_nobuffers(); then PageSwapBacked had to skip that too.

No actual problems seen with this procedure recently, but if you look into
what the clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)+set_page_dirty(newpage) is actually
achieving, it turns out to be nothing more than moving the PageDirty flag,
and its NR_FILE_DIRTY stat from one zone to another.

It would be good to avoid a pile of irrelevant decrementations and
incrementations, and improper event counting, and unnecessary descent of
the radix_tree under tree_lock (to set the PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY which
radix_tree_replace_slot() left in place anyway).

Do the NR_FILE_DIRTY movement, like the other stats movements, while
interrupts still disabled in migrate_page_move_mapping(); and don't even
bother if the zone is the same.  Do the PageDirty movement there under
tree_lock too, where old page is frozen and newpage not yet visible:
bearing in mind that as soon as newpage becomes visible in radix_tree, an
un-page-locked set_page_dirty() might interfere (or perhaps that's just
not possible: anything doing so should already hold an additional
reference to the old page, preventing its migration; but play safe).

But we do still need to transfer PageDirty in migrate_page_copy(), for
those who don't go the mapping route through migrate_page_move_mapping().

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-02-26 10:52:43 UTC  ``` It was reported that due to buffer overflow, it is possible for remote TCP endpoint to trigger the opposite TCP endpoint to write to a socket in sequence which causes the ethernet driver to send arbitrary kernel data over the ethernet interface instead of a portion of the intended packet data.  Initially this issue was believed to be present in a number of mainline drivers in 3.10.x and 4.4.2 vanilla kernel sources. After further investigation it was found that only [atl2] driver (code in drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/atlx/atl2.c) from the list of suspected drivers is vulnerable.  As a result, certain conditions should be met to trigger the issue: - the [atl2] driver and the corresponding network card (which believed to be not so frequently used) should be present on the target system - an application should make such a sequence of calls that a network buffer for the data to be transmitted is scattered - hardware checksumming should be enabled so the packet checksum is correct  The above makes this vulnerability less probable to be hit.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-16 14:40:38 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1318336](show_bug.cgi?id=1318336 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2117 kernel: Kernel memory leakage to ethernet frames due to buffer overflow in ethernet drivers [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-16 14:41:00 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/658>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c3)  Vladis Dronov    2016-03-22 09:46:53 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Justin Yackoski (Cryptonite)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c4)  Vladis Dronov    2016-03-22 09:59:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as the suspected driver does not advertise that it has scatter-gather feature, which presence is essential for the flaw.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2, namely the [atl2] Ethernet driver which is the only driver affected. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases might address this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-03 15:45:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:2574 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2574.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-03 19:42:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:2584 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2584.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-03 21:33:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:2574 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2574.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1312298#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-03 21:48:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:2584 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2584.html>   ``` |  |

mm: migrate dirty page without clear\_page\_dirty\_for\_io etcclear\_page\_dirty\_for\_io() has accumulated writeback and memcg subtleties
since v2.6.16 first introduced page migration; and the set\_page\_dirty()
which completed its migration of PageDirty, later had to be moderated to
\_\_set\_page\_dirty\_nobuffers(); then PageSwapBacked had to skip that too.
No actual problems seen with this procedure recently, but if you look into
what the clear\_page\_dirty\_for\_io(page)+set\_page\_dirty(newpage) is actually
achieving, it turns out to be nothing more than moving the PageDirty flag,
and its NR\_FILE\_DIRTY stat from one zone to another.
It would be good to avoid a pile of irrelevant decrementations and
incrementations, and improper event counting, and unnecessary descent of
the radix\_tree under tree\_lock (to set the PAGECACHE\_TAG\_DIRTY which
radix\_tree\_replace\_slot() left in place anyway).
Do the NR\_FILE\_DIRTY movement, like the other stats movements, while
interrupts still disabled in migrate\_page\_move\_mapping(); and don't even
bother if the zone is the same. Do the PageDirty movement there under
tree\_lock too, where old page is frozen and newpage not yet visible:
bearing in mind that as soon as newpage becomes visible in radix\_tree, an
un-page-locked set\_page\_dirty() might interfere (or perhaps that's just
not possible: anything doing so should already hold an additional
reference to the old page, preventing its migration; but play safe).
But we do still need to transfer PageDirty in migrate\_page\_copy(), for
those who don't go the mapping route through migrate\_page\_move\_mapping().

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2584)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation mishandled socket options. A local attacker could abuse concurrent access to the socket options to escalate their privileges, or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) via a crafted sendmsg system call. (CVE-2016-3841, Important)
* Several Moderate and Low impact security issues were found in the Linux kernel. Space precludes documenting each of these issues in this advisory. Refer to the CVE links in the References section for a description of each of these vulnerabilities. (CVE-2013-4312, CVE-2015-8374, CVE-2015-8543, CVE-2015-8812, CVE-2015-8844, CVE-2015-8845, CVE-2016-2053, CVE-2016-2069, CVE-2016-2847, CVE-2016-3156, CVE-2016-4581, CVE-2016-4794, CVE-2016-5829, CVE-2016-6136, CVE-2016-6198, CVE-2016-6327, CVE-2016-6480, CVE-2015-8746, CVE-2015-8956, CVE-2016-2117, CVE-2016-2384, CVE-2016-3070, CVE-2016-3699, CVE-2016-4569, CVE-2016-4578)

Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson (Samsung) for reporting CVE-2016-2053; Tetsuo Handa for reporting CVE-2016-2847; the Virtuozzo kernel team and Solar Designer (Openwall) for reporting CVE-2016-3156; Justin Yackoski (Cryptonite) for reporting CVE-2016-2117; and Linn Crosetto (HP) for reporting CVE-2016-3699. The CVE-2015-8812 issue was discovered by Venkatesh Pottem (Red Hat Engineering); the CVE-2015-8844 and CVE-2015-8845 issues were discovered by Miroslav Vadkerti (Red Hat Engineering); the CVE-2016-4581 issue was discovered by Eric W. Biederman (Red Hat); the CVE-2016-6198 issue was discovered by CAI Qian (Red Hat); and the CVE-2016-3070 issue was discovered by Jan Stancek (Red Hat).

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.
