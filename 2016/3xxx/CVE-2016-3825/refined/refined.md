CVE-2016-3825:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: An incorrect calculation of buffer size when handling opaque handles within the Mediaserver.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: A buffer overflow vulnerability that occurs when allocating memory for an opaque handle, due to `nAllocLen` being set to the size of the handle rather than the size of the data it contains.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges by executing arbitrary code within the context of the Mediaserver process.
  - Attack vectors: A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to run code on the device, typically via a malicious app.
