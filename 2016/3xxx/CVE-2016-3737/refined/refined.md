          "vulnerability": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary Python bytecode (via jython) on the JBoss Operations Network server. The agent sends HTTP POST requests to `/jboss-remoting-servlet-invoker/ServerInvokerServlet/?generalizeSocketException=true` with a payload of an `org.jboss.remoting.InvocationRequest` object, which leads to deserialization of untrusted data. The vulnerability is due to the presence of Jython library (rhq-scripting-python-4.12.0.JON330GA.jar) which can be exploited for remote code execution via deserialization.",
