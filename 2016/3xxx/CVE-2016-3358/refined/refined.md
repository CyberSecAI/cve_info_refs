Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer rights will be less impacted, but are still vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email attack scenario:**  An attacker sends a specially crafted file to the user and convinces the user to open it.
- **Web-based attack scenario:**  An attacker hosts a website (or leverages a compromised website) with a specially crafted file and convinces the user to visit the site and open the malicious file.
- In some instances, the preview pane is also an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted file that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file either through email, a website or by previewing it.
