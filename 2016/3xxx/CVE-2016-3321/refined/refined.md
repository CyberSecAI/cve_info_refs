Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer handles `file://` URLs differently when they point to existing files versus non-existent ones. Specifically, when a `file://` URL points to an existing file, IE displays an error dialog. However, when the URL points to a non-existent file, IE attempts to navigate to a default error page `res://ieframe.dll/dnserrordiagoff.htm` without displaying an error dialog, a behavior that may be blocked by the browser's pop-up blocker. This difference in behavior can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to detect the existence of local files on a user's system. This information disclosure occurs due to the inconsistent handling of file URLs by Internet Explorer.
-   **HTML5 Sandbox Bypass:** The use of HTML5 sandbox iframes, while designed for security, is exploited to suppress the error dialog when accessing existing local files, thus allowing the detection of file existence through the `onload` event.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker can determine the presence of specific files on a user's local system by crafting a webpage containing a sandboxed iframe that attempts to load a local file.
-   This could potentially expose sensitive information or provide reconnaissance data to an attacker that can be used in other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack can be performed locally using an HTML file with the Internet zone "Mark of the Web" set, or from a shared network drive.
-   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted HTML page that includes an iframe with the sandbox attribute. This iframe will attempt to load a local file via a `file://` URL.
-   The attacker must convince the victim to open this HTML file using Internet Explorer.
-   The vulnerability can not be exploited from a regular web site because `file://` URLs are blocked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have the ability to provide the victim with a malicious HTML file. This can be achieved via local file access or via a network share.
-   The attacker needs to entice a user into opening the specially crafted HTML file with Internet Explorer.
-   The attacker does not need to be able to connect to the machine remotely, as this vulnerability relies on the victim opening a local file.
-   The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability (according to Microsoft's mitigating factors).

**Additional Details**
*   This vulnerability is specific to Internet Explorer 10 and 11, as earlier versions do not support HTML5 sandbox iframes.

In summary, CVE-2016-3321 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Internet Explorer that allows an attacker to determine if local files exist by abusing differences in how the browser handles existing vs non-existing `file://` URLs within a sandboxed iframe.
