Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `brin_page_type()` and `brin_metapage_info()` functions within the `pageinspect` extension of PostgreSQL. These functions lacked proper checks to ensure that only superusers could execute them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness was the absence of permission checks for non-superusers when calling `brin_page_type()` and `brin_metapage_info()`.
- **Potential for Memory Exposure:**  By passing specially crafted `bytea` values to these functions, an attacker could potentially trigger a server crash and/or expose a small amount of server memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server Crash:** A malicious user could cause the PostgreSQL server to crash by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Limited Memory Exposure:** The attacker could potentially gain access to a small number of bytes from the server's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Connection:** An attacker needs a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
- **Function Call:** The attacker would need to call the vulnerable functions `brin_page_type()` or `brin_metapage_info()` with specially crafted `bytea` inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database User:** The attacker needs to be a database user, although they do not need to be a superuser, which is the key issue.
- **Ability to Execute Functions:** The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary functions, or specifically call the vulnerable functions `brin_page_type()` or `brin_metapage_info()`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved adding superuser permission checks to the mentioned `pageinspect` functions, ensuring that non-superusers could no longer trigger the vulnerability.
- The content explicitly mentions that while the memory exposure is limited, the crash makes this a security issue.
