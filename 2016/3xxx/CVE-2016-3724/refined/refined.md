  "CVE-2016-3724": {

    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive information such as passwords and other secrets that were intended to be encrypted.",
    "attack_vectors": "By having extended read access to the Jenkins configuration, attackers can access encrypted secrets.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have extended read access privileges within Jenkins.",
