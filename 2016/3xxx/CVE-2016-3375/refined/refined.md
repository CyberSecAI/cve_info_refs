  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3375",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine in Internet Explorer access objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way the Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine in Internet Explorer handle objects in memory which can lead to memory corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is an administrator, the attacker could take full control of the system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "A specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.",
        "Compromised websites or websites that accept/host user-provided content or advertisements.",
        "Enticing user to open a malicious email or instant message link or attachment."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to convince a user to view a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer, by luring the user through an email, IM or by leveraging a compromised site. The vulnerability exists within the OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript engine within Internet Explorer."
