Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3762:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2016-3762 in the Android Security Bulletin for July 2016. The bulletin also includes a description of the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is overly permissive access to generic socket types by untrusted processes due to how SELinux was configured. Specifically, socket classes not known to SELinux kernel code were lumped into a generic "socket" class. This included the `AF_MSM_IPC` socket class.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect SELinux Policy:**  The SELinux policy allowed untrusted applications to access generic socket types, which should have been restricted.
- **Overly Broad Socket Class:**  Grouping of unknown socket types into a generic class without proper restrictions.
- **Missing Restrictions:** Lack of proper restrictions on access to the generic "socket" class.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:**  A local malicious application could gain access to certain uncommon socket types.
- **Potential Kernel Code Execution:** This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the kernel.
- **Security Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing security measures designed to make exploitation more difficult.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Android versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1.
- The fix involved revoking access to the generic socket class for `isolated_app`, `untrusted_app` and `shell` domains in older Android releases.
- A neverallow rule was added to ensure that the rule isn't present for untrusted domains.
- This is described as conceptually a backport of a previous fix but affecting fewer domains to avoid potential breakage.
