Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-3303

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how the Windows Graphics Component (specifically GDI+) handles specially crafted embedded fonts. It occurs due to an invalid pointer arithmetic out-of-bounds read in the `ValidateBitmapInfo` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `bytes_per_row_signed` variable can hold a negative value due to an integer overflow in its calculation. This is due to attacker control of the `biWidth`, `biPlanes` and `biBitCount` fields.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:**  A negative `bytes_per_row_signed` value, combined with a `biHeight` greater than 1, causes the `first_row` pointer to point to an invalid memory location, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the application attempts to access bitmap data through it, causing a crash.
*  **Insufficient EMF Record Size Check:** The `GetBitmapFromRecord` function's check for sufficient bitmap data size, is flawed. It can return 0 in case of invalid values in the bitmap headers, thus passing the size check, opening an exploitable path.
*   **Improper Handling of Embedded Fonts:** The core issue is the incorrect handling of embedded fonts, specifically within bitmap structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Once in control, the attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit leads to a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious websites that exploit the vulnerability when visited by users.
*   **File Sharing Attacks:** Attackers can provide malicious documents containing crafted fonts that trigger the vulnerability when opened.
*  **EMF files:** Exploits can be delivered through EMF files that contain embedded bitmaps in records such as `EMR_PLGBLT`, `EMR_BITBLT`, `EMR_STRETCHBLT`, `EMR_STRETCHDIBITS`.
*   **Preview Pane:**  The preview pane in Microsoft Office is an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a website or send files:**  The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious webpage or send files that can be opened by the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the malicious site or open the malicious file for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the GDI+ library, which is part of the Windows graphics component.
*   The provided exploit uses an `EMR_PLGBLT` record with a malformed, embedded bitmap and specifically crafted values for `biWidth`, `biHeight`, `biPlanes`, and `biBitCount`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when `GetDibBitsSize()` returns 0 due to the malformed header, resulting in a negative `bytes_per_row_signed` value and the `first_row` pointer addressing an invalid memory location, causing a crash in a memcpy operation.
*   The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows, Microsoft Office, Skype for Business, Lync and Live Meeting Console.
