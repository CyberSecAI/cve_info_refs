The provided content relates to CVE-2016-3066.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The spice-gtk widget automatically synchronizes the local desktop client clipboard with the remote guest OS clipboard, even when the remote desktop window does not have focus. This happens as soon as data in the local client clipboard is updated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unconditional clipboard synchronization: The clipboard data is automatically transferred to the remote guest OS without any explicit user action (e.g., copy/paste).
- Lack of user awareness: Users are not notified that their clipboard contents are being shared with the remote guest OS.
- Data leakage: Sensitive information (e.g., passwords) in the clipboard can be leaked to potentially untrusted guest operating systems.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive data exposure: Passwords, API keys, and other confidential data copied to the clipboard can be unintentionally exposed to a malicious guest OS.
- Unauthorized access to host resources: A malicious guest can potentially request clipboard data, allowing it to extract data from the host without the user's knowledge.
- Violation of privacy:  The user's expectation of clipboard privacy is violated, as data is sent without explicit consent or awareness.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a compromised or malicious guest OS running within a virtual machine.
- The guest OS can request the clipboard contents, which are automatically sent by the spice-gtk widget without the user having focused on the guest OS window.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a guest OS that is connected to a host system via spice-gtk
- The attacker requires the spice guest agent to be enabled and running in the guest OS.
