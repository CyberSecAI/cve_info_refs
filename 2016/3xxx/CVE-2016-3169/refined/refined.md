{
  "CVE-2016-3169": {
    "Description": "Saving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles (User module - Drupal 6 and 7)",
    "Root cause": "Some specific contributed or custom code may call Drupal's user_save() API in a manner different than Drupal core. Depending on the data that has been added to a form or the array prior to saving, this can lead to a user gaining all roles on a site.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of user roles during account saving"
    ],
    "Impact": "A user can gain all roles on a site, potentially leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized access.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation of custom code that improperly calls the user_save() API"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger a specific sequence of events by interacting with a custom code or contributed module that calls the user_save() API with an explicit category and code that loads all roles into the array."
