Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a failure in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper handling of objects in memory by the win32k.sys kernel-mode driver leading to an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- This grants the attacker the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.
    - Take control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- An attacker must first log on to the system.
- Subsequently, the attacker must execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the target system.
- The attacker also requires the capability to execute a malicious application on the system.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-123
- The exploitability assessment from the first document indicates an "Exploitation More Likely" rating for both the latest and older software releases.
- The update for this vulnerability is included in the cumulative updates for Windows, as well as security-only updates.
