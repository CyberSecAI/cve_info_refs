Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3716:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization within the MSL (Magick Scripting Language) coder of ImageMagick. This allows an attacker to insert malicious commands into a specially crafted image file. The `msl` pseudo protocol can be used to move arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **File Manipulation:** The MSL coder does not sufficiently validate file paths, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary source and destination paths for file operations.
*   **Insecure Pseudo-Protocol:** The use of the `msl` pseudo-protocol, which was intended for manipulating image files, can be exploited for unauthorized file movements.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Movement:** An attacker can move files to arbitrary locations with any extension, bypassing typical file type checks.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** When combined with a vulnerable web service that uploads text files and then processes images, an attacker can move a specially crafted file (e.g., a PHP shell) to a web-accessible directory and achieve code execution by then accessing the file through the web server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file that includes an MSL script, which contains commands to move files. This can be included directly or indirectly using svg/mvg formats.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to an application or system that processes images using ImageMagick. This can be done through uploading or any input mechanism.
*   **Knowledge of file location:** For the attack to be effective, the attacker would need to know the path of the files to be manipulated. This is more effective when a system is used for processing files, as the attacker can then upload files into temporary directories.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was part of a series of flaws dubbed "ImageTragick" that affected various ImageMagick coders and pseudo-protocols.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by processing images with the vulnerable MSL coder, and therefore it is important to ensure that ImageMagick does not process untrusted input.
*   Mitigation strategies included disabling the vulnerable coders (MSL, among others) in the ImageMagick policy file or removing the delegates altogether in older versions of ImageMagick.

The provided content also indicates that this vulnerability, along with other related flaws, was addressed by multiple vendors, including Red Hat, SUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu, through patches and updates. These often included disabling the vulnerable coders and adding input sanitization, or updating policy.xml.

Therefore:

```
Root cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper sanitization within the MSL (Magick Scripting Language) coder allowing the insertion of malicious commands.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: File manipulation due to insecure pseudo-protocol usage, insufficient validation of file paths.
Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary file movement, potential code execution.
Attack vectors: Malicious image file containing an MSL script with commands to move files.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to supply a malicious image to a vulnerable ImageMagick processing system, knowledge of target file paths.
