## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid for Trusty

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

x86/xen: suppress hugetlbfs in PV guests
Huge pages are not normally available to PV guests. Not suppressing
hugetlbfs use results in an endless loop of page faults when user mode
code tries to access a hugetlbfs mapped area (since the hypervisor
denies such PTEs to be created, but error indications can't be
propagated out of xen\_set\_pte\_at(), just like for various of its
siblings), and - once killed in an oops like this:

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3050-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

10 August 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1485-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1485.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1485.112)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Multiple race conditions where discovered in the Linux kernel's ext4 file

system. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(disk corruption) by writing to a page that is associated with a different

users file after unsynchronized hole punching and page-fault handling.

([CVE-2015-8839](/security/CVE-2015-8839))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel could overflow reference counters on

systems with more than 32GB of physical ram and with RLIMIT\_MEMLOCK set to

infinite. A local unprivileged attacker could use to create a use-after-

free situation, causing a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4558](/security/CVE-2016-4558))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-24-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-24.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-24.43)

  -
  [4.4.0-24.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-24.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-wily](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-wily) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

Multiple race conditions where discovered in the Linux kernel's ext4 file

system. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(disk corruption) by writing to a page that is associated with a different

users file after unsynchronized hole punching and page-fault handling.

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel could overflow reference counters on

systems with more than 32GB of physical ram and with RLIMIT\_MEMLOCK set to

infinite. A local unprivileged attacker could use to create a use-after-

free situation, causing a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4558](/security/CVE-2016-4558))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1012-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.4.0-1012.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1012.16)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Hash: SHA1

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2016-3961 / XSA-174
                              version 3

                hugetlbfs use may crash PV Linux guests

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Huge (2Mb) pages are generally unavailable to PV guests.  Since x86
Linux pvops-based kernels are generally multi purpose, they would
normally be built with hugetlbfs support enabled.  Use of that
functionality by an application in a PV guest would cause an
infinite page fault loop, and an OOPS to occur upon an attempt to
terminate the hung application.

IMPACT
======

Depending on the guest kernel configuration, the OOPS could result
in a kernel crash (guest DoS).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All upstream x86 Linux versions operating as PV Xen guests are
vulnerable.

ARM systems are not vulnerable.  x86 HVM guests are not vulnerable.

x86 Linux versions derived from linux-2.6.18-xen.hg (XenoLinux) are not
vulnerable.

Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernels are not vulnerable.

We believe that non-Linux guests are not vulnerable, as we are not
aware of any with an analogous bug.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM guests will avoid this issue.

Not enabling hugetlbfs use, by not altering the boot time default value
of zero in /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages (which can only be written by the
root user) will avoid this issue.

It is possible that disabling (or not enabling) the "panic on OOPS"
behavior (via use of the "oops=panic" command line option or the
"panic_on_oops" sysctl) will also avoid this issue, by limiting the
effect to an application crash.  We are not currently sure whether
this is an effective mitigation, as we are not sure whether any locks
or mutexes are held at the point of the crash.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Vitaly Kuznetsov from Red Hat.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

[cbec70e183f76b4081ebba05c0a8105bd4952d164a2e5c40528c05bf8861ddef  xsa174.patch](xsa174.patch)
$

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of patches or mitigations is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because such host configuration changes would be user mode
visible, which could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

                 CVE-2016-5244

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-7515, CVE-2016-2184, CVE-2016-2185, CVE-2016-2186,
CVE-2016-2187, CVE-2016-3136, CVE-2016-3137, CVE-2016-3138,
CVE-2016-3140

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that various USB
    drivers do not sufficiently validate USB descriptors.  This
    allowed a physically present user with a specially designed USB
    device to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2016-0821

    Solar Designer noted that the list 'poisoning' feature, intended
    to mitigate the effects of bugs in list manipulation in the
    kernel, used poison values within the range of virtual addresses
    that can be allocated by user processes.

CVE-2016-1237

    David Sinquin discovered that nfsd does not check permissions when
    setting ACLs, allowing users to grant themselves permissions to a
    file by setting the ACL.

CVE-2016-1583

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that the eCryptfs
    filesystem could be used together with the proc filesystem to
    cause a kernel stack overflow.  If the ecryptfs-utils package is
    installed, local users could exploit this, via the
    mount.ecryptfs_private program, for denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2117

    Justin Yackoski of Cryptonite discovered that the Atheros L2
    ethernet driver incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote
    attacker could take advantage of this flaw to obtain potentially
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2016-2143

    Marcin Koscielnicki discovered that the fork implementation in the
    Linux kernel on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four
    page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

CVE-2016-3070

    Jan Stancek of Red Hat discovered a local denial of service
    vulnerability in AIO handling.

CVE-2016-3134

    The Google Project Zero team found that the netfilter subsystem does
    not sufficiently validate filter table entries. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this for denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. Debian disables
    unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled with the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this allows privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-3156

    Solar Designer discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux
    kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects
    properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial
    of service (networking outage) in the host OS.

CVE-2016-3157 / XSA-171

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the x86_64 (amd64) task switching
    implementation did not correctly update the I/O permission level
    when running as a Xen paravirtual (PV) guest.  In some
    configurations this would allow local users to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2016-3672

    Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll noted that it was possible to disable
    Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) for x86_32 (i386) programs
    by removing the stack resource limit. This made it easier for local
    users to exploit security flaws in programs that have the setuid or
    setgid flag set.

CVE-2016-3951

    It was discovered that the cdc_ncm driver would free memory
    prematurely if certain errors occurred during its initialisation.
    This allowed a physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    escalate their privileges.

CVE-2016-3955

    Ignat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check
    the length of data received for a USB buffer.  This allowed denial
    of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured
    as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to
    impersonate it over the network.  A system configured as a usbip
    server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.

CVE-2016-3961 / XSA-174

    Vitaly Kuznetsov of Red Hat discovered that Linux allowed the use of
    hugetlbfs on x86 (i386 and amd64) systems even when running as a Xen
    paravirtualised (PV) guest, although Xen does not support huge
    pages. This allowed users with access to /dev/hugepages to cause a
    denial of service (crash) in the guest.

CVE-2016-4470

    David Howells of Red Hat discovered that a local user can trigger a
    flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of key lookups in the keychain
    subsystem, leading to a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-4482, CVE-2016-4485, CVE-2016-4486, CVE-2016-4569,
CVE-2016-4578, CVE-2016-4580, CVE-2016-5243, CVE-2016-5244

    Kangjie Lu reported that the USB devio, llc, rtnetlink, ALSA
    timer, x25, tipc, and rds facilities leaked information from the
    kernel stack.

CVE-2016-4565

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that various components
    in the InfiniBand stack implemented unusual semantics for the
    write() operation.  On a system with InfiniBand drivers loaded,
    local users could use this for denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-4581

    Tycho Andersen discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel
    did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local user can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2016-4805

    Baozeng Ding discovered a use-after-free in the generic PPP layer in
    the Linux kernel. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service (system crash), or potentially escalate
    their privileges.

CVE-2016-4913

    Al Viro found that the ISO9660 filesystem implementation did not
    correctly count the length of certain invalid name entries.
    Reading a directory containing such name entries would leak
    information from kernel memory.  Users permitted to mount disks or
    disk images could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2016-4997 / CVE-2016-4998

    Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that missing input sanitising
    in Netfilter socket handling may result in denial of service. Debian
    disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled
    with the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this also allows
    privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an

error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](/security/CVE-2016-4470))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](/security/CVE-2016-5243))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-107-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -

  -
  [3.2.0-107.148](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-107.148)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-107-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-107.148](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-107.148)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-107-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-107.148](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-107.148)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
