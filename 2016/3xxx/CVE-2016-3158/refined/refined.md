Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-3158

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect workaround in Xen for handling FPU state on AMD CPUs. Specifically, the hypervisor wasn't properly handling the FSW.ES bit (Exception Summary bit) in the FPU status word (FSW) when restoring FPU state via `XRSTOR`.
- AMD CPUs do not load the FIP, FDP, and FOP registers from memory when there isn't an unmasked exception.  The FSW.ES bit is calculated based on exception and mask bits, not directly written, and the Xen workaround did not properly emulate this behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The incorrect handling of the FSW.ES bit led to a leak of FPU register contents (FIP, FDP, FOP). These registers contain the instruction and data pointers, as well as the opcode of the last FPU instruction.
- **Incorrect FPU State Restoration:** The core issue is the incorrect emulation of FPU state restoration on AMD processors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Address Space Information Leakage:** A malicious guest could potentially use the leaked FPU register contents to gain insight into another domain's address space.
- **Timing Information Leakage:** The vulnerability can leak timing information related to the other domain.
- **Covert Channel:**  The information leakage creates a low-bandwidth covert channel that can be used for observation of a target guest and potentially aid in further attacks, such as bypassing ASLR (address space layout randomization).
- Although unlikely, the leaked information *could* potentially be used to compromise cryptographic keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest can exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the hypervisor restores FPU state via the `XRSTOR` instruction on AMD CPUs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a guest virtual machine running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- The vulnerability is specific to AMD x86 systems and affects both PV and HVM guests.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability is related to XSA-172.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jan Beulich from SUSE.
-  The vulnerability was present in Xen versions 4.0 and onwards.
- The advisory distinguishes between CVE-2016-3158 and CVE-2016-3159:
    - CVE-2016-3158 refers to the code change in `xrstor` function that is required for all versions but is sufficient only on Xen 4.3.x.
    - CVE-2016-3159 refers to the code change in `fpu_fxrstor` which is applicable for later versions only, and must be combined with the change for CVE-2016-3158.
