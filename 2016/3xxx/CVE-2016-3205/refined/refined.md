Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2016-3205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the JScript and VBScript engines handle objects in memory. Specifically, there are memory corruption issues when rendering these objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in the JScript and VBScript scripting engines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE).
- An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take full control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerabilities and convince a user to visit it via Internet Explorer.
- **Embedded ActiveX:** An attacker could embed a malicious ActiveX control (marked "safe for initialization") within an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.
- **Compromised/Malicious Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised or user-provided content websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted website or embed a malicious ActiveX control.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious document.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how the JScript and VBScript engines handle objects in memory.
- The provided documents list the affected software versions and the update details for this CVE.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows Vista and "Moderate" for Windows Server 2008/2008R2
- This CVE is also addressed by the cumulative security update for Internet Explorer (MS16-063) for systems running Internet Explorer 9, 10 and 11.
- A workaround involves restricting access to vbscript.dll and jscript.dll which may break websites using those technologies.
