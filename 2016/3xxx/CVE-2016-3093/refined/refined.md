- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper implementation of the cache used to store method references in the OGNL expression language used by Apache Struts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OGNL cache poisoning.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) attack, potentially blocking access to the website.
- **Attack vectors:**  By exploiting the OGNL expression language's cache mechanism. Specific details on how the malicious OGNL expressions are delivered or constructed are not given here.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject crafted OGNL expressions, likely through user input or other means to reach the vulnerable code in the application.
