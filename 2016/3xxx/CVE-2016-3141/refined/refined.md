  "CVE-2016-3141": {
    "Description": "ext/mysqlnd/mysqlnd.c in PHP before 5.4.43, 5.5.x before 5.5.27, and 5.6.x before 5.6.11 uses a client SSL option to mean that SSL is optional, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a cleartext-downgrade attack, a related issue to CVE-2015-3152.",
    "Root cause": "The PHP mysqlnd extension incorrectly interprets a client SSL option, treating it as optional rather than required. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to perform a cleartext downgrade attack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of SSL options in the PHP mysqlnd extension.",
      "Cleartext downgrade vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact": "Man-in-the-middle attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication between a PHP application and a MySQL server by forcing the connection to use cleartext instead of encrypted SSL.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based man-in-the-middle attack."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the PHP client and the MySQL server."
  },
   "CVE-2014-9767": {
        "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in the ZipArchive::extractTo function in ext/zip/php\_zip.c in PHP before 5.4.45, 5.5.x before 5.5.29, and 5.6.x before 5.6.13 and ext/zip/ext\_zip.cpp in HHVM before 3.12.1 allows remote attackers to create arbitrary empty directories via a crafted ZIP archive.",
        "Root cause": "The `ZipArchive::extractTo` function in PHP does not properly sanitize file paths extracted from a ZIP archive, allowing for directory traversal.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Directory traversal vulnerability",
            "Improper input validation of ZIP archive file paths."
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote attackers can create arbitrary empty directories on the server, which could potentially be used to further exploit other vulnerabilities.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Sending a crafted ZIP archive containing malicious directory traversal sequences to a server using PHP."
        ],

    "CVE-2016-3142": {
        "Description": "The phar\_parse\_zipfile function in zip.c in the PHAR extension in PHP before 5.5.33 and 5.6.x before 5.6.19 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) by placing a PK\\x05\\x06 signature at an invalid location.",
         "Root cause": "The `phar_parse_zipfile` function in PHP's PHAR extension does not properly validate the location of a 'End of central directory record' structure within a ZIP file. By placing this signature at an invalid location within the buffer, attackers can trigger an out-of-bounds read.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability",
            "Inadequate input validation of ZIP structures in PHAR files"
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote attackers can potentially obtain sensitive information from the server's process memory or cause a denial of service (application crash) by exploiting this vulnerability.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Sending a specially crafted ZIP file with an improperly placed 'End of central directory record' structure to a PHP application processing PHAR files."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send or upload a specially crafted ZIP file to the affected server."

   "CVE-2015-8835": {
        "Description": "The make\_http\_soap\_request function in ext/soap/php\_http.c in PHP before 5.4.43, 5.5.x before 5.5.27, and 5.6.x before 5.6.12 does not properly retrieve keys, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference, type confusion, and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized data representing a numerically indexed \_cookies array, related to the SoapClient::\_\_call method in ext/soap/soap.c.",
        "Root cause": "The `make_http_soap_request` function in PHP's SOAP extension fails to properly handle numerically indexed cookies within serialized data, leading to type confusion and a null pointer dereference during a `SoapClient::__call` method execution.",
        "Weaknesses": [
