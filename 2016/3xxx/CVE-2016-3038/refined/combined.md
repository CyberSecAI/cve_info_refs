# Security Bulletin: Multiple Security Vulnerabilities exist in IBM Cognos TM1

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Several vulnerabilities have been addressed for: IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition Quarterly CPU - Jul 2016; Recover Password with Valid Session Key; System Name Stored Cross-site Scripting; TM1 Server Stack Exhaustion Denial of Service; OpenSource OpenSSL; Sweet32: Birthday attacks on 64-bit block ciphers in TLS (openssl) and Opensource Apache Tomcat, Commons FileUpload Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2000-1254](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2000-1254)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2177](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2180](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2180)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted time-stamp file to cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 7.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2183](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-3036](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3036)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Cognos TM1 is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing packets. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 7.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114612> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-3037](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3037)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Cognos TM1 provides a service to return the victim's password with a valid session key. An authenticated attacker with user interaction could obtain this sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 5.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114613> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-3038](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3038)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Cognos TM1 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114614> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-3092](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3092)

**DESCRIPTION:** Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the Apache Commons FileUpload component. By sending file upload requests, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the server to become unresponsive.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114336> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-3485](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3485)

**DESCRIPTION:** An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Networking component has no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact.

CVSS Base Score: 2.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115273> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
