- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, which can then alter the intended functionality, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated and have user interaction to inject the malicious script.
