{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a race condition in MmsProvider.openFile. The method validated the _data column in the database, and then called ContentProvider.openFileHelper which reads from the database again. This can cause a second read to get an updated, potentially malicious value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "The race condition can lead to access to files as the phone (radio) user ID, potentially allowing access to sensitive data or malicious file execution.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "position": "Local malicious application",
      "capabilities": "Ability to trigger the race condition via MmsProvider's openFile functionality"
    },
        "details": "The fix involves calling MmsProvider.safeOpenFileHelper which does a single check instead of two separate database reads."
