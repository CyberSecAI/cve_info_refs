{
  "CVE-2016-3693": {
    "description": "A provisioning template containing `inspect` will expose sensitive information about the Rails controller and application when rendered when using Safemode rendering (the default setting). This includes the application secret token, possibly permitting a privilege escalation.",
    "root_cause": "The `inspect` method was not being properly restricted by the safemode gem, which when used in a provisioning template can expose sensitive data from the Rails application.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with permissions to create templates can cause internal Rails information to be displayed, resulting in potentially sensitive information being disclosed such as routes, secret tokens and caches. The exposure of the application's secret token can allow for privilege escalation if the application uses signed cookies.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious provisioning template containing the inspect method.",
      "An attacker with permissions to create/modify templates."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs permissions to create/modify provisioning templates to inject the malicious code.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was present in the safemode gem when initialized with a delegate object that was a Rails controller. The `inspect` method was exposing the controller's internal information. The fix involved removing the `inspect` method from the allowed methods in the safemode gem."
