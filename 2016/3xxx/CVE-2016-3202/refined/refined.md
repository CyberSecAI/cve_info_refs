Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3202:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Chakra JavaScript engine (in Microsoft Edge) and the JScript and VBScript engines (in Internet Explorer) handle objects in memory. Specifically, improper handling of objects in memory can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities in the scripting engines of both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer due to improper handling of objects in memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can take control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a malicious website designed to trigger the memory corruption vulnerability via the browser (Edge or IE). Users must be convinced to visit the malicious site.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content/ads.
- **Embedded ActiveX controls:** Attackers can embed malicious ActiveX controls marked "safe for initialization" within applications or Office documents that use the browser rendering engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host or inject malicious content into web pages.
- Ability to entice users into visiting a malicious page or opening a document containing a malicious embedded control.
- No special privileges are required on the victim system; the attacker gains the user's privileges.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability affects both client and server versions of Windows, but the severity of impact is generally higher on client versions ("Critical") than on server versions ("Moderate").
- The provided documents indicate that no public disclosure or active exploitation was known at the time of the bulletin's publication.
- The bulletin provides a workaround of restricting access to `vbscript.dll` and `jscript.dll` to mitigate the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability is addressed by updates that modify how the respective scripting engines handle objects in memory.
