Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2016-3292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer failing a check, which allows for a sandbox escape.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of zone and integrity settings.
- The vulnerability is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability, meaning it allows an attacker to escalate their privileges within the system.
- The vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution on its own but can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escape the Internet Explorer sandbox.
- An attacker could then potentially leverage these elevated privileges, in combination with other vulnerabilities, to execute arbitrary code.
- If code execution is achieved, the attacker gains the same user rights as the current user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system, potentially installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to visit a malicious website specifically crafted to exploit this vulnerability, typically by enticing the user via email or instant message, or by getting them to open a malicious email attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to host or control content on a website or be able to distribute malicious email attachments.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with this malicious content using Internet Explorer.
- The attacker must combine this vulnerability with another vulnerability that allows code execution to fully compromise the system.
