Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3385:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the Scripting Engine in Microsoft browsers handles objects in memory. Specifically, it's related to memory corruption issues during the rendering process within the scripting engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption within the scripting engine. This occurs when the engine improperly handles objects in memory during rendering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed through Internet Explorer or Edge.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised or user-content-hosting websites to exploit the vulnerability.
- **ActiveX Controls:** Attackers can embed malicious ActiveX controls (marked as "safe for initialization") within applications or Office documents that host the scripting engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to host or inject malicious content, or to trick users into visiting the malicious website/opening a document with a malicious ActiveX control.
- Attackers have to convince users to interact with the malicious content, as they cannot force users to view the attacker-controlled content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer across various Windows operating systems.
- The provided text notes that EMET can mitigate this vulnerability if properly configured.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how the Scripting Engine handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability is rated as Critical for Windows clients and Moderate for Windows servers.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds beyond applying the security update.
