Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input when displaying group names within the spacewalk-java web interface. Specifically, the application failed to properly escape HTML and Javascript embedded within the group names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs when malicious code (HTML/Javascript) is injected into the application and stored in the database. When the affected data is retrieved and displayed in a user's browser, the injected malicious code is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious content, such as HTML and JavaScript, into group names. This malicious content is then displayed to other users when they view snapshot data related to those groups within the web interface.
- The injected scripts can be used to perform various malicious actions within the context of a user's session, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Defacing web pages
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface by inserting malicious code via API or via the UI itself when creating groups. The malicious code is stored and later executed when users view pages that display these group names and the associated snapshot data

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify group names within Red Hat Satellite. This implies they would need to have some level of authenticated access to the Red Hat Satellite instance.
-  The attacker must also be able to craft malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads and inject them as part of a group name.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is related to Bugzilla bug [1322747](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1322747), and was fixed in Red Hat Satellite 5.7.
- The vulnerability was addressed in the RHSA-2016:1484 advisory.
- The vulnerability is similar to another XSS issue (CVE-2016-3080) which affected monitoring probes in Red Hat Satellite, also fixed in the same advisory.
