- Compromised websites: Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites that accept user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or inject a specially crafted webpage with malicious JavaScript that triggers the vulnerability in the XSS filter.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious page. This could be achieved through social engineering tactics (e.g. tricking the user into clicking a link).

**Additional Notes**
- The provided document details that the update fixes the issue by correcting how the Internet Explorer XSS Filter validates JavaScript.
- This vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows Clients and "Low" for Windows Servers.
