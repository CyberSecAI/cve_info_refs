  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege in the MediaTek power management driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies within the MediaTek power management driver, allowing a local malicious application to potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel, resulting in a local permanent device compromise. This may require reflashing the operating system to fully recover the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local malicious application on the device is required to exploit this vulnerability. This application must be able to leverage the affected driver."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to install and execute a malicious application on the targeted Android device. The attacker also requires the ability to utilize the vulnerable MediaTek power management driver."
