- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Access Manager appliances are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, which means that the application does not properly validate requests to ensure they originate from a legitimate user interaction.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts. This could lead to unauthorized changes or actions being performed on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website or link which is crafted by the attacker and then accessed by a legitimate user, which can then trigger the forged request to the vulnerable application
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a legitimate user to trigger a malicious request while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable application. This can be achieved by tricking the user to click on a malicious link or visiting a malicious website while being logged into the vulnerable web application.
