Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3288:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is the ability of a specially crafted webpage to corrupt memory within the context of Internet Explorer.
- **Use-After-Free:** Although not explicitly mentioned as "use-after-free", the exploit from exploit-db suggests this is the case because it triggers a read AV, indicating an access to freed memory or other invalid memory location. The exploit code provided also includes garbage collection calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user.
- **System Compromise:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-Based Attack:** Attackers can host a specially crafted website or inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content.
- **User Interaction:** Attackers must convince users to view the malicious content, typically through email lures, instant messages, or by enticing them to open a malicious attachment. There is no way to force users to visit the attacker-controlled content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the capability to host or inject specially crafted web content.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to interact with the malicious content.
- **No Direct Access Needed:** The attacker doesn't require direct access to the user's system, as the exploit is triggered through the user's browser.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The provided exploit code from Exploit-DB shows that a combination of javascript calls and html elements with specific attributes and event handlers can cause the memory corruption.
- The exploit utilizes `FileReader` and `Blob` objects and calls `CollectGarbage()`.
- The exploit triggers a read access violation, indicating the vulnerability leads to a use-after-free condition.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using IE 11 on Windows.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-3288 is a critical memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer that allows for remote code execution. An attacker can exploit it by convincing a user to view a specially crafted website, resulting in the attacker gaining control of the user's system. The exploit from exploit-db shows that a use-after-free vulnerability was present.
