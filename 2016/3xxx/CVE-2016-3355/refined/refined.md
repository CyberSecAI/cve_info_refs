  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of objects in memory within GDI leading to unintended privilege elevation."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, enabling them to install software, manipulate data, and create new accounts with administrative privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker must log on to the affected system and then execute a specially crafted application."
