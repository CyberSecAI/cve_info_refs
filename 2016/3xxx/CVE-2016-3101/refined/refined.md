- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Extra Columns plugin rendered user-supplied HTML in tool tips without filtering them through the configured markup formatter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view tooltips.
- **Attack vectors**: User-supplied HTML in tool tips.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply HTML content into the tooltip fields of the Extra Columns plugin.
