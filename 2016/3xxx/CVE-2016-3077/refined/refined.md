Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3077:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `VersionMapper.fromKernelVersionString` method within the oVirt Engine RestAPI. This method incorrectly parses kernel version strings, leading to an array index out-of-bounds exception when encountering unexpected or complex version formats. The API expects simple version strings like "4.2.1-5", but some OS's use more complex formats like "2.6.37.6-24-default".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The API fails to validate or sanitize kernel version strings properly, leading to the exception.
*   **Array Index Out-of-Bounds:** The parsing logic assumes a specific structure of the version string, and complex strings cause the code to attempt to access an array element outside the array's bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious user with access to a virtual machine (VM) can configure the VM to report a crafted kernel version string. This will cause the API to crash when attempting to retrieve information about the VM.
*   **Service Disruption:** When retrieving information about multiple VMs, the API will fail for all VMs if one VM has the malicious version string. This disrupts the ability to retrieve VM information via the API.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious VM Configuration:** An attacker with access to a VM can configure it to report a specifically crafted kernel version string.
*   **API Request Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when the API attempts to process the malicious kernel version string, typically when retrieving information about the VM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **VM Access:** The attacker must have access to a VM within the oVirt environment. This access can be a user that can configure certain properties of a VM.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs an understanding of how the API is used to retrieve VM information.
