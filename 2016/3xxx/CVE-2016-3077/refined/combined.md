| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c0)  Juan Hernández    2016-02-24 15:30:29 UTC  ``` Currently the API expects that the guest kernel version numbers like "4.2.1-5", but some operating systems use more complicated version numbers, for example "2.6.37.6-24-default". This makes the server crash, with an array index out of bounds exception.  The problem is in the "VersionMapper.fromKernelVersionString" method. It needs to be made more tolerant, supporting versions that don't match the expected format.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c1)  Oved Ourfali    2016-02-29 12:36:25 UTC  ``` Juan - should we target to 3.6.5?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c2)  Juan Hernández    2016-03-03 11:23:46 UTC  ``` This same also happens when parsing the version product number, so I'm raising the severity.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c3)  Sven Kieske    2016-03-03 12:25:12 UTC  ``` isn't this a security issue? you can crash through a version number, this can lead to a dos.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c4)  Juan Hernández    2016-03-03 12:36:27 UTC  ``` Well, the "crash" is just a failure of the operation that retrieves the representation of a virtual machine, or the summary of the API, not a complete crash of the system.  A malicious user with access to a VM could configure it so that it reports a version number that causes that crash. That would mean than when that VM is reported (also when all VMs are reported) the operation would fail. This can be considered as DoS attack, so in that sense you are right that this can be considered a security issue. But not a serious one, in my opinion.  The problem with the product version is less attackable, because users can't change the product version.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c5)  Karolína Hajná    2016-03-18 13:00:41 UTC  ``` Verified on 3.6.4-0.1.el6   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c6)  Adam Mariš    2016-03-24 09:19:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to Juan Hernández from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c4)) > Well, the "crash" is just a failure of the operation that retrieves the > representation of a virtual machine, or the summary of the API, not a > complete crash of the system. >  > A malicious user with access to a VM could configure it so that it reports a > version number that causes that crash.

But not a serious one, in my opinion. >  > The problem with the product version is less attackable, because users can't > change the product version.  Does one faulty VM report make the retrieval operation for all other VMs to fail?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c7)  Oved Ourfali    2016-03-24 09:27:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adam Mariš from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c6)) > (In reply to Juan Hernández from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616#c4)) > > Well, the "crash" is just a failure of the operation that retrieves the > > representation of a virtual machine, or the summary of the API, not a > > complete crash of the system. > >  > > A malicious user with access to a VM could configure it so that it reports a > > version number that causes that crash.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1321972#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-03-29 13:38:09 UTC  ``` It was found that parsing complicated kernel version numbers leads to array index out-of-bounds exception in VersionMapper.fromKernelVersionString method. A malicious user with access to VM could configure it so that it reports a version number that causes API to crash. When the VM with crafted kernel version number is reported among with other VMs, the representation retrieving operation will fail also for all other VMs.  Product bug:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1311616](show_bug.cgi?id=1311616 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-3077 The API crashes when parsing unexpected version numbers")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1321972#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-03-29 13:38:46 UTC  ```  Created ovirt-engine-sdk-java tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1321974](show_bug.cgi?id=1321974 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2016-3077 ovirt-engine-sdk-java: ovirt-engine: Crash of API when parsing unxepected version number [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1321975](show_bug.cgi?id=1321975 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2016-3077 ovirt-engine-sdk-java: ovirt-engine: Crash of API when parsing unxepected version number [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1321972#c2)  Juan Hernández    2016-03-29 13:45:11 UTC  ``` Consider closing this bug, as the issue doesn't affect any Fedora component, only the oVirt engine server side, which isn't part of fedora.   ``` |  |
