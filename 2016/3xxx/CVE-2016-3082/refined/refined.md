- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `XSLTResult` in Apache Struts allows the location of a stylesheet to be passed as a request parameter. This can be exploited to inject remotely executable code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unvalidated input leading to remote code execution. The `XSLTResult` component does not properly sanitize or validate the stylesheet location provided through request parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the server running the affected Apache Struts application.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating request parameters to specify a malicious stylesheet, an attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server where the vulnerable Struts application is deployed. They also need to be able to craft a request with a malicious stylesheet location.
