{
  "CVE-2016-3189": {
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in bzip2recover, leading to a null pointer dereference, or a write to a closed file descriptor.",
    "Root cause": "The `bzip2recover` utility does not properly handle the `outFile` variable after closing the output file, leading to a use-after-free condition when processing a crafted bzip2 archive.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted bzip2 archive using `bzip2recover`, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service (crash). In some cases, it could also lead to a write to a closed file descriptor.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted bzip2 archive",
      "Processing the crafted archive via `bzip2recover` utility"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted bzip2 archive to the user, who must then execute `bzip2recover` on it."
