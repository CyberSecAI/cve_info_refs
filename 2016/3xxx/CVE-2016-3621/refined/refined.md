Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `LZWEncode` function within `tif_lzw.c` of the `libtiff` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `LZWEncode` function performs an out-of-bounds read when processing a crafted BMP image with the `-c lzw` parameter. Specifically, the code at `tif_lzw.c:915` attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS). The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash of the application using the library.
- In theory, the vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated in the provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted BMP image that is processed by the `bmp2tiff` tool with the `-c lzw` option.
- A user needs to be enticed into processing the crafted image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a BMP file, and have a user process it via the `bmp2tiff` tool with the `-c lzw` option.
- The attacker would not need access to the system where the vulnerable software is running as long as they can convince a user to process the malicious image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `LZWEncode` function in `tif_lzw.c`.
- The specific line of code causing the issue is at `tif_lzw.c:915`.
- The issue was reported by Mei Wang of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360.
- The `bmp2tiff` tool has been removed from later versions of libtiff, which would prevent this vulnerability from being exploited using this tool. The vulnerability exists in the libtiff library if it is used directly in an application.
- The provided AddressSanitizer output shows a heap-buffer-overflow error at the point of exploitation.
