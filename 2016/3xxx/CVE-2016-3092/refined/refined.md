Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-3092:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of multipart boundary lengths within the Apache Commons FileUpload library. Specifically, when the boundary string length was just below the buffer size used for reading uploaded files, a denial-of-service (DoS) could occur due to inefficient processing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a multipart request with a boundary string length just below the buffer size used to read uploaded files, which forces inefficient processing and consumes excessive resources.
- **Incomplete fix for request smuggling:** In some cases, Tomcat does not reject a request containing an invalid `Content-Length` header, allowing for a request smuggling attack if a reverse proxy improperly handles the invalid header.
- **Security manager bypass:** A malicious web application could use various bypass methods such as the Tomcat system property replacement feature, or the use of the Servlet status manager to bypass a configured security manager.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted file upload request, resulting in high CPU consumption and unresponsiveness of the server.
-   In some instances a security manager can be bypassed by malicious web apps, allowing access to sensitive information
- Information leakage such as session ID and response body

**Attack vectors:**
-  The primary attack vector is through sending specifically crafted HTTP multipart requests with a boundary string length just below a certain threshold.
-  In other scenarios attack vectors are through HTTP request smuggling, a vulnerable or missing SecurityManager, or a lack of input validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
-  For a successful DoS, the attacker only needs to send the crafted boundary string with a length just below buffer size.
- For Security Manager bypass or info disclosure, the attacker needs to be a user able to deploy a web application to the server
- For HTTP request smuggling, the attacker needs to send a request with an invalid header, and for a vulnerability to be exploitable, be positioned behind a reverse proxy that interprets the header differently.
