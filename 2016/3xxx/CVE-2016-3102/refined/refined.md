- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Script Security plugin's Groovy sandbox implementation did not properly restrict direct field access (`foo.@bar`) or get/set array operations (`foo[bar]`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incomplete Groovy sandbox protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Allows execution of unauthorized code, potentially leading to data compromise or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  By crafting malicious Groovy scripts that utilize the uncovered field or array access methods.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to execute Groovy scripts within the Jenkins environment. This typically involves having some level of access and permissions within the Jenkins instance to run such scripts, meaning an attacker needs to be a user with script execution rights, not an anonymous user.
