## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

USN-2968-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single

writes greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing

to certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2015-8830](/security/CVE-2015-8830))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe

buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for

[CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0774](/security/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-86-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-86.130~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-86.130~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-86-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-86.130~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-86.130~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-36.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-36.41)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-36.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-36.41)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-36.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-36.41)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-36.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-36.41)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-36.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-36.41)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-36.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-36.41)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-36.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-36.41)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-wily](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-wily) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

## Details

USN-2971-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 15.10.

This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware

Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 15.10 for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2016-5244

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-7515, CVE-2016-2184, CVE-2016-2185, CVE-2016-2186,
CVE-2016-2187, CVE-2016-3136, CVE-2016-3137, CVE-2016-3138,
CVE-2016-3140

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that various USB
    drivers do not sufficiently validate USB descriptors.  This
    allowed a physically present user with a specially designed USB
    device to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2016-0821

    Solar Designer noted that the list 'poisoning' feature, intended
    to mitigate the effects of bugs in list manipulation in the
    kernel, used poison values within the range of virtual addresses
    that can be allocated by user processes.

CVE-2016-1237

    David Sinquin discovered that nfsd does not check permissions when
    setting ACLs, allowing users to grant themselves permissions to a
    file by setting the ACL.

CVE-2016-1583

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that the eCryptfs
    filesystem could be used together with the proc filesystem to
    cause a kernel stack overflow.  If the ecryptfs-utils package is
    installed, local users could exploit this, via the
    mount.ecryptfs_private program, for denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2117

    Justin Yackoski of Cryptonite discovered that the Atheros L2
    ethernet driver incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote
    attacker could take advantage of this flaw to obtain potentially
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2016-2143

    Marcin Koscielnicki discovered that the fork implementation in the
    Linux kernel on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four
    page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

CVE-2016-3070

    Jan Stancek of Red Hat discovered a local denial of service
    vulnerability in AIO handling.

CVE-2016-3134

    The Google Project Zero team found that the netfilter subsystem does
    not sufficiently validate filter table entries. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this for denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. Debian disables
    unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled with the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this allows privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-3156

    Solar Designer discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux
    kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects
    properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial
    of service (networking outage) in the host OS.

CVE-2016-3157 / XSA-171

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the x86_64 (amd64) task switching
    implementation did not correctly update the I/O permission level
    when running as a Xen paravirtual (PV) guest.  In some
    configurations this would allow local users to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2016-3672

    Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll noted that it was possible to disable
    Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) for x86_32 (i386) programs
    by removing the stack resource limit. This made it easier for local
    users to exploit security flaws in programs that have the setuid or
    setgid flag set.

CVE-2016-3951

    It was discovered that the cdc_ncm driver would free memory
    prematurely if certain errors occurred during its initialisation.
    This allowed a physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    escalate their privileges.

CVE-2016-3955

    Ignat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check
    the length of data received for a USB buffer.  This allowed denial
    of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured
    as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to
    impersonate it over the network.  A system configured as a usbip
    server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.

CVE-2016-3961 / XSA-174

    Vitaly Kuznetsov of Red Hat discovered that Linux allowed the use of
    hugetlbfs on x86 (i386 and amd64) systems even when running as a Xen
    paravirtualised (PV) guest, although Xen does not support huge
    pages. This allowed users with access to /dev/hugepages to cause a
    denial of service (crash) in the guest.

CVE-2016-4470

    David Howells of Red Hat discovered that a local user can trigger a
    flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of key lookups in the keychain
    subsystem, leading to a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-4482, CVE-2016-4485, CVE-2016-4486, CVE-2016-4569,
CVE-2016-4578, CVE-2016-4580, CVE-2016-5243, CVE-2016-5244

    Kangjie Lu reported that the USB devio, llc, rtnetlink, ALSA
    timer, x25, tipc, and rds facilities leaked information from the
    kernel stack.

CVE-2016-4565

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that various components
    in the InfiniBand stack implemented unusual semantics for the
    write() operation.  On a system with InfiniBand drivers loaded,
    local users could use this for denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-4581

    Tycho Andersen discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel
    did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local user can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2016-4805

    Baozeng Ding discovered a use-after-free in the generic PPP layer in
    the Linux kernel. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service (system crash), or potentially escalate
    their privileges.

CVE-2016-4913

    Al Viro found that the ISO9660 filesystem implementation did not
    correctly count the length of certain invalid name entries.
    Reading a directory containing such name entries would leak
    information from kernel memory.  Users permitted to mount disks or
    disk images could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2016-4997 / CVE-2016-4998

    Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that missing input sanitising
    in Netfilter socket handling may result in denial of service. Debian
    disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled
    with the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this also allows
    privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1482-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1482.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1482.109)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-104-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-104.145)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-104-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-104.145)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-104-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-104.145)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-104-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-104.145)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-104-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-104.145)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-104-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-104.145)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-104-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-104.145)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1029-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1029.37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1029.37)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic for Trusty

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single

writes greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing

to certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2015-8830](/security/CVE-2015-8830))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single

writes greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing

to certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2015-8830](/security/CVE-2015-8830))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe

buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for

[CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0774](/security/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2016-3157 / XSA-171
                              version 4

         I/O port access privilege escalation in x86-64 Linux

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Clarify Vulnerable Systems section.

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

IRET and POPF do not modify EFLAGS.IOPL when executed by code at a
privilege level other than zero.  Since PV Xen guests run at privilege
level 3 (for 64-bit ones; 32-bit ones run at privilege level 1), to
compensate for this the context switching of EFLAGS.IOPL requires the
guest to make use of a dedicated hypercall (PHYSDEVOP_set_iopl).  The
invocation of this hypercall, while present in the 32-bit context
switch path, is missing from its 64-bit counterpart.

IMPACT
======

User mode processes not supposed to be able to access I/O ports may
be granted such permission, potentially resulting in one or more of
in-guest privilege escalation, guest crashes (Denial of Service), or
in-guest information leaks.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All upstream x86-64 Linux versions operating as PV Xen guests are
vulnerable.

ARM systems are not vulnerable.  x86 HVM guests are not vulnerable.
32-bit Linux guests are not vulnerable.

x86-64 Linux versions derived from linux-2.6.18-xen.hg (XenoLinux) are
not vulnerable.

We believe that non-Linux guests are not vulnerable, as we are not
aware of any with an analogous bug.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or 32-bit PV guests will avoid this issue.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andy Lutomirski.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue for the indicated Linux
versions.

xsa171.patch           Linux 4.5-rc7, Linux 4.4.x

$ sha256sum xsa171*
[5d47ead1212c735b444ac8f82e7f311cda3473fe3847e576c3772ce020265dfd  xsa171.patch](xsa171.patch)
$

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

The patch is a change to the domU, ie, to the guest, not to hosts.

Where the guest kernel is provided by the host administrator
- ------------------------------------------------------------

Deployment of the patch by the host administrator is NOT permitted
(except where all the affected systems and VMs are administered and
used only by organisations which are members of the Xen Project
Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on
public cloud systems is NOT permitted.

This is because a the cloud guest administrator is almost certainly in
a position to see the changes that are made by to the kernel even if
the kernel is provided by the host administrator.

Deployment is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

Where the guest kernel is provided by the guest administrator
- -------------------------------------------------------------

Deployment of the patch (or another which is substantially similar) by
the guest administrator is permitted during the embargo ONLY if
 (i) the host administrator organisation is also a member of the Xen
     Project Security Issues Predisclosure List.
 (ii) all the guest's users are also members of predisclosure list.
     (guest users includes administrators of Linux containers running
     within the guest).

Restriction (i) is because the host administrator can see changes that
made to the kernel by a guest administrator.  Restriction (ii) is
because it is difficult to fully conceal the Linux kernel from
unprivileged guest user processes.

If the host is not operated by a member of the predisclosure list, or
the guest has users outside the predisclousre list, deployment is
permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

In any case
- -----------

Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, or whose situation is not clearly covered
above, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
