{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel video driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can gain elevated privileges leading to arbitrary code execution within the kernel. This could lead to a permanent device compromise, possibly requiring reflashing the operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local. A malicious application installed on the device can exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device and be able to execute code on it."
