Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the Chakra JavaScript engine in Microsoft Edge. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in how the engine handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The ZDI advisories (ZDI-16-367 and ZDI-16-368) explicitly mention that the vulnerability occurs in the implementation of the JavaScript `filter` and `map` methods, as defined on typed arrays. By performing certain operations in script, an attacker can cause JavaScript to write outside the bounds of the array.
- **Memory corruption:** The Microsoft security bulletin states that the vulnerability could corrupt memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative rights, an attacker could gain full control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, modify or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In the case of an administrator user, the attacker could take full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Microsoft Edge.
- **Compromised websites/advertisements:** Malicious content can be injected into compromised websites or advertisement networks, which would then exploit the vulnerability when loaded by a user with Microsoft Edge.
- **ActiveX controls:** An attacker could embed a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" into an application or Office document, leveraging the Edge rendering engine to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Malicious files:** The vulnerability could be triggered by opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** An attacker needs to be able to host a website, inject malicious content into a site, or send malicious files to the victim.
- **User interaction:** The user must visit a malicious website, open a malicious file, or interact with an application containing malicious content, making user interaction a requirement for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 is vulnerable.
- Microsoft has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as Critical for Windows clients and Moderate for Windows Servers.
- The vulnerability is related to how the Chakra JavaScript engine handles objects in memory and is not specific to a single method.
- The Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS has a filter to protect against this vulnerability.
