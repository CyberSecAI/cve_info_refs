Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `process_db_args` function of the LDAP KDB module in MIT Kerberos 5. This function, responsible for processing database arguments, can encounter a NULL pointer if `strtok_r` returns NULL due to an empty string in the `db_args` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. The code doesn't check if `strtok_r` returns a valid pointer before dereferencing it. This can lead to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service by causing the `kadmind` daemon to crash. This affects the availability of Kerberos services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be initiated over the network.
- **Crafted Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted request to modify a principal.
- **Empty DB Argument:** The crafted request includes an empty `DB` argument to the `modify_principal` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated and have permission to modify principal entries. This indicates that the attacker would need some level of legitimate access within the Kerberos realm.
- **Specific Configuration:** The `kadmind` daemon must be configured to use the LDAP KDB module for this vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in MIT Kerberos 5 versions through 1.13.4 and 1.14.x through 1.14.1.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of database arguments (`db_args`).

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability is resolved by applying the upstream patch:
<https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/08c642c09c38a9c6454ab43a9b53b2a89b9eef99>

This patch introduces a null check for the return value of `strtok_r()` to avoid dereferencing a null pointer.
This patch was included in the following releases:
- Red Hat krb5-1.14.1-26.el7
- SUSE krb5 >= 1.12.1-28.1
- Debian krb5 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u9
- openSUSE krb5-1.12.2-24.1
