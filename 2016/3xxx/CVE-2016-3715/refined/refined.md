Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3715:

**1. Verification:**

The content from multiple sources (openwall.com, bugzilla.redhat.com, suse.com, debian.org, oracle.com, and exploit-db.com) directly references CVE-2016-3715 and describes a file deletion vulnerability in ImageMagick, confirming that the content is related to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `ephemeral` pseudo-protocol within ImageMagick. This protocol, designed for temporary file handling, inadvertently allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths, leading to their deletion after processing with ImageMagick.
- Specifically, the `ephemeral` coder within ImageMagick removes files specified in the input after reading them.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unsanitized Input:** ImageMagick does not validate or sanitize the file paths used with the `ephemeral` protocol, allowing an attacker to specify any location accessible by the user running ImageMagick.
-   **Abuse of intended functionality:** While the `ephemeral` protocol was designed for temporary file handling, the lack of restrictions on file paths allows an attacker to remove arbitrary files.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **File Deletion:** A successful exploit leads to the deletion of files on the server that are accessible to the user running the ImageMagick process. This can cause data loss or disruption of services relying on the deleted files.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted Image File:** An attacker creates a specially crafted image file (e.g., SVG or MVG) that includes the malicious `ephemeral` protocol, specifying the target file for deletion.
-   **Processing via ImageMagick:**  The attacker tricks a user or a web service to process this malicious image file using ImageMagick.
-   The exploitation doesn't rely on file extensions so attackers can bypass file type checks by renaming the image to e.g., `*.jpg` or `*.png`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an image file that is processed by a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This might be by tricking a user to download the malicious image, or via a web service that processes user-uploaded images.
-   **No special privileges needed:** The attack can be performed by any user (local or remote) who can supply the malicious input to ImageMagick. The files can only be deleted if the user running ImageMagick has access to them.

**Additional Details from Analysis:**

-   **Incomplete Patches:** The initial patches for these vulnerabilities were reported as incomplete, leading to a second round of fixes and mitigations being deployed.
-   **Mitigation Strategies:** As a workaround, disabling the vulnerable coders (`EPHEMERAL`, `URL`, `MVG`, and `MSL`, `HTTPS`) in the `/etc/ImageMagick/policy.xml` file is the recommended mitigation approach. In older versions of ImageMagick where `policy.xml` is not available, renaming the vulnerable `.so` files was a viable approach.
-   **CVSS Scores:**  CVSS v2 scores rate the confidentiality impact as None and integrity impact as Partial, with availability having partial impact. CVSS v3 has high integrity impact but no impact on availability.
-   **"ImageTragick" name:**  These ImageMagick vulnerabilities were collectively named "ImageTragick," underscoring their severity and interconnectedness.

**Summary of Information:**

CVE-2016-3715 is a file deletion vulnerability in ImageMagick where the `ephemeral` protocol is used to specify arbitrary file paths that will be deleted after being processed by ImageMagick. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted image file containing the `ephemeral` protocol, causing files accessible to the user running ImageMagick to be deleted.
