Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3076:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `j2k_encode_entry` function within the `Jpeg2kEncode.c` file of the python-pillow library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** When encoding a specially crafted Jpeg2000 file, the `malloc` call within `j2k_encode_entry` might allocate a buffer smaller than required. Subsequent write operations to this buffer would overflow onto the heap, corrupting memory.
- The buffer size calculation `tile_width * tile_height * components * prec / 8` might not accurately determine the necessary buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** Overwriting memory on the heap can lead to various consequences, such as program crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Image:** An attacker can craft a malicious Jpeg2000 image file that, when processed by a vulnerable version of python-pillow, triggers the buffer overflow in the `j2k_encode_entry` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to supply a crafted Jpeg2000 image:** The attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted Jpeg2000 image to the vulnerable application using python-pillow.
- **Target must use a vulnerable version of python-pillow:** The target system must be using a version of python-pillow between 2.5.0 and 3.1.1, as these versions introduced the vulnerable code and before it was patched.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in python-pillow version 2.5.0 with the addition of `libImaging/Jpeg2KEncode.c` and fixed in a version after 3.1.1.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 are not affected as the vulnerability was introduced in python-pillow, and RHEL7 ships with python-pillow 2.0.0, which is not vulnerable. RHEL5 and 6 use the older python-imaging library which was forked into python-pillow.
