  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the kernel.",
      "It requires compromising a privileged process before exploitation."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to a local permanent device compromise. This may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local malicious application is able to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a malicious application to be installed on the device. They need to compromise a privileged process before being able to exploit the vulnerability.",
     "details": "This vulnerability is located within the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver. The vulnerability allows for an elevation of privilege, which permits a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. Exploitation requires prior compromise of a privileged process."
