**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=866

The following crash was observed in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 running under Windows 7 x86 with application verifier enabled.

File versions are:
  mso.dll: 14.0.7166.5000
  ppcore.dll: 14.0.7168.5000

Attached crashing file: 3525170180.ppt

663088d5 8b4d08          mov     ecx,dword ptr [ebp+8]
663088d8 ff7110          push    dword ptr [ecx+10h]  ds:0023:1979aeb0=????????

The ecx register is pointing to invalid memory in this crash. Looking at the call stack and disassembly above we can see that this value was passed in as the first argument to the crashing function. The calling function obtained this value from a pointer in stack memory at 0x0024e46c + 0x10:

0:000> dd poi(0024e46c)
1cb7cfa0  00000000 1cb7cfa0 00000002 19045ea0
1cb7cfb0  1979aea0 00000000 00000000 00000000

We can verify that this is allocated memory and find the function that allocated it:

(address changed between runs and is now 0x1cb7cfa0)

0:000> !heap -p -a 1cb7cfa0
    address 1cb7cfa0 found in
    _DPH_HEAP_ROOT @ 1261000
    in busy allocation (  DPH_HEAP_BLOCK:         UserAddr         UserSize -         VirtAddr         VirtSize)
                                1d2b14e0:         1cb7cfa0               5c -         1cb7c000             2000

Setting breakpoints on ppcore!DllGetLCID+0x00176360 and subsequent memory write access breakpoints at eax+0x10 (there are multiple hits) eventually resulted in the same file crashing with a different context:

eax=00000000 ebx=17c2cb50 ecx=00000000 edx=00000000 esi=1a36eea0 edi=1a36eea0

Given the different crashing contexts related to timing when breakpoints are set I suspect this to be a heap corruption bug that Application Verifier does not detect.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Security Update for Microsoft Office (3185852)

Published: September 13, 2016 | Updated: September 22, 2016

**Version:** 2.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* Microsoft Office saves documents.
* Click-to-Run components handle memory addresses.
* affected versions of Office and Office components handle objects in memory.
* Microsoft Outlook determines the end of MIME messages.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3185852](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3185852).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft APP-V ASLR Bypass - CVE-2016-0137

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Click-to-Run (C2R) components handle objects in memory, which could lead to an Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass.

An attacker who successfully exploited the information disclosure vulnerability could use the obtained information to bypass the ASLR security mechanism in Windows, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The ASLR bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, an attacker could use the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could leverage the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.

To exploit the ASLR bypass, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. Workstations are primarily vulnerable to the potential ASLR bypass.

The security update addresses the ASLR bypass by correcting how C2R components handle memory addresses.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft APP-V ASLR Bypass | [CVE-2016-0137](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0137) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this bypass condition.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this bypass condition.

## Microsoft Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0141

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Visual Basic macros in Office improperly exports a userâs private key from the certificate store while saving a document. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could potentially gain access to the userâs private key.

The attacker would have to use another vulnerability, or employ a social engineering technique, to obtain the saved document from the user.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office saves documents.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

Note that where the severity is indicated as Critical in the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector for [CVE-2016-3357](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-3357).

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.

## Microsoft Office Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2016-3366

A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft Outlook does not strictly adhere to RFC2046, and improperly identifies the end of a MIME attachment. An improper MIME attachment ending may cause antivirus or antispam scanning to not work as intended.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted email attachment to a user in an attempt to launch a social engineering attack, such as phishing.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Outlook determines the end of MIME messages.
