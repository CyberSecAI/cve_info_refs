Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Office software. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in `ppcore.dll` within PowerPoint when processing a specially crafted `.ppt` file. The root cause appears to be related to an invalid memory access when the code dereferences an invalid pointer. The specific function, `DllGetLCID`, is involved in the crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is memory corruption due to incorrect object handling. This leads to an invalid pointer dereference, causing a crash.
- **Invalid Pointer Reference:** The code attempts to access memory using a pointer that is either invalid or pointing to an unallocated memory region. Specifically, the `ecx` register is pointing to invalid memory causing the crash
- **Heap Corruption:** The issue may be related to heap corruption, but this is not explicitly confirmed by Application Verifier

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **System Compromise:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system.
- **Denial of Service:** The provided crash information indicates a denial-of-service condition. The application crashes when processing the crafted file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Opening:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file (specifically, a .ppt file in this case).
- **Email Attachment:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious file as an email attachment and enticing the user to open it.
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a website or leverage a compromised website with a crafted file designed to trigger the vulnerability when the user opens it.
- **Preview Pane:** The vulnerability can be exploited by simply previewing the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted File:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file (e.g. a .ppt file) to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious file, for example by sending it as an attachment or through a malicious website.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Microsoft Office 2010, but also affects other versions of Microsoft Office software including Office 2007, 2013, 2016, Office RT, Office for Mac and related services.
-  The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of objects in memory when opening or previewing a malicious file.
