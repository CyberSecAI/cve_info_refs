Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3185:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2016-3185. The bug report from bugs.php.net and the SUSE bugzilla entry specifically mention this CVE ID. The description of the vulnerability in the bug reports aligns with the official CVE description, focusing on type confusion issues within the `SoapClient::__call()` method and its impact on memory safety.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:
    *   The primary root cause is improper type validation within the `SoapClient::__call()` method, specifically when processing cookies. The code assumes that cookie keys are always strings, which is incorrect when a SoapClient object is crafted with a numerically indexed array as \_cookies. This leads to type confusion and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   The second problem occurs in php\_http.c, where type checks are not performed on a temporary variable (`tmp`) when processing data related to the request, which also leads to type confusion.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Type Confusion**: The code doesn't properly validate the data types it's processing, leading to type confusion. In particular, both  `zend_hash_get_current_key_ex` and subsequent `Z_*` calls in the http SOAP request handler do not check if their data is of the expected type, which results in use of user controlled integers as zval's and dereferencing them as char\*.
    *   **Null Pointer Dereference**: Incorrect assumption about key being always a `char` leads to a null pointer dereference.
    *   **Arbitrary Memory Exfiltration**:  The `in_domain()` function is used to search for arbitrary strings in memory using the output of the function's strcmp().
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Crash/Denial of Service (DoS)**: The type confusion can lead to segmentation faults or crashes due to invalid memory access, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Arbitrary Memory Write**: Locally, memory mapping could be exploited to achieve arbitrary memory writes, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Arbitrary Memory Address Exfiltration**: An attacker can read arbitrary memory addresses using the in\_domain() function and relying on the strcmp() output to search for arbitrary strings in memory starting from a given address.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Remote**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, for example by submitting a crafted SOAP request containing a malicious SoapClient object.
    *   **Local**: An attacker could exploit this locally to get arbitrary memory write and code execution, with knowledge of memory layout.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs the ability to influence the \_cookies property of a serialized SoapClient object, typically through an unserialize() call.
    *   For remote exploitation, the attacker also needs control of the host parameters, or ability to override those through `__proxy_host` and `__proxy_port` parameters.
    *   For local exploitation, the attacker requires the ability to map specific memory addresses, which can allow for arbitrary memory writes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report provides two Proof of Concepts (PoCs) written in PHP demonstrating both a null pointer dereference and type confusion causing segmentation fault.
*   The bug report also notes that the vulnerability can be exploited to read arbitrary memory through controlled calls to `unserialize()`. This combined with bug [#70121](bug.php?id=70121) allows an attacker to read arbitrary memory.
*   The report outlines that restrictions imposed by the `host` parameter could be bypassed using `__proxy_host` and `__proxy_port` parameters
*   A patch for this vulnerability was created and added to the PHP source repository ([http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=eaf4e77190d402ea014207e9a7d5da1a4f3727ba](http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=eaf4e77190d402ea014207e9a7d5da1a4f3727ba)), as well as a second commit [http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=c96d08b27226193dd51f2b50e84272235c6aaa69](http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=c96d08b27226193dd51f2b50e84272235c6aaa69) which provides the same fix for 5.6 branch.
*   SUSE, Ubuntu and openSUSE all have released updates for this vulnerability, with SUSE also issuing multiple advisories and tracking the issue in their bugzilla system.

In summary, the provided information describes a vulnerability in PHP's SOAP extension that can be exploited remotely or locally by an attacker to cause a crash, arbitrary memory writes and leak sensitive memory information. The vulnerability stems from missing type validation checks which leads to type confusions and exploitation.
