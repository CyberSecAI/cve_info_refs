- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a Message Channel Agent removes a large message from a queue and applies data conversion to the message, the result could overflow the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper data conversion handling leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The channel ends abnormally, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user can send a large message that triggers data conversion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user with the ability to send messages to a queue.
