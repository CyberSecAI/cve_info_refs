- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from the generation of error messages that may include sensitive information about the environment, users, or associated data. This occurs when a specially crafted HTTP request is sent to the IBM Security Access Manager appliances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure through error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can obtain sensitive information from error messages.
- **Attack vectors:** Specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to send the crafted HTTP request.
