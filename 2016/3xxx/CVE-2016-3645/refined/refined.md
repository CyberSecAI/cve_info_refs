{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the dec2tnef library when handling TNEF attachments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow when calculating the size of a buffer to allocate for attachment data",
      "Lack of proper input validation or bounds checking on the attacker-controlled value used in the calculation."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory allocation failure or other undefined behavior when a large, attacker-controlled value causes an integer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a specially designed TNEF file with a large attachment size value that triggers the overflow.",
        "This can be done by sending an email with a malicious attachment"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted TNEF file to a vulnerable system that uses the dec2tnef library to process the attachment. The vulnerable code is located in Symantec's Scan Engine and potentially other products"
  },
  "additional_information": {
        "affected_function": "Attachment::setDataFromAttachment() in libdec2tnef.so",
        "overflow_location": "The integer overflow occurs in the calculation (count + 1) * 4 when determining the size of the buffer to allocate for attachment data, where 'count' is attacker-controlled",
        "proof_of_concept": "A proof of concept is available which demonstrates that the vulnerability is reachable on the Symantec Scan Engine and it is also suspected that other products using the dec2tnef library may also be vulnerable"
