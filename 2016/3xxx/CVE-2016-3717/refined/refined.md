Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-3717:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance**

The provided content directly references CVE-2016-3717 and provides details about it. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `LABEL` coder within ImageMagick. This coder doesn't properly sanitize or restrict access to files, allowing an attacker to specify a file path which is then read by the coder.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a local file read vulnerability. The `LABEL` coder allows a local attacker to read the content of arbitrary files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read the content of any file accessible to the user running ImageMagick. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including but not limited to configuration files, cryptographic keys, and other private data. The impact is described as "Complete Confidentiality Impact" in CVSS v2.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Attack Vector:** The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted image file (e.g. mvg) that uses the `label:` pseudo-protocol, to the vulnerable process (ImageMagick)
    *   **Network Attack Vector (in some contexts):** if the vulnerable system is a web server, it can be tricked into rendering images using `label:` pseudo-protocol from a crafted image that is supplied by a remote attacker via the internet.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Attacker:** The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger ImageMagick to process a crafted image, as a local user.
    *   **Remote Attacker:** In the context of a web server that renders images for remote clients, a remote attacker would need to supply the image to be processed to the server.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The `label:` pseudo-protocol is used to specify a file path that is then read by the coder. An image processed with the vulnerable `LABEL` coder can be crafted to reveal the content of local files in the resulting image.

**3. Additional Information from the Content**

*   **Affected Versions:** ImageMagick before 6.9.3-10 and 7.x before 7.0.1-1.
*   **Mitigation:** Disabling the `LABEL` coder in ImageMagick's `policy.xml` file and sanitizing the input. Some Linux distributions (e.g. Suse) are disabling all the vulnerable coders by default in their policy files.
*   **CVSS Scores:** Both CVSS v2 and v3 scores are provided, and although their scores differ, they both indicate that this vulnerability has significant impact on data confidentiality. The CVSSv3 score also takes into account the local attack vector.
    *   **CVSS v2:**
        *   Base Score: 7.1
        *   Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N
    *   **CVSS v3:**
        *   Base Score: 5.5
        *   Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (NVD)
