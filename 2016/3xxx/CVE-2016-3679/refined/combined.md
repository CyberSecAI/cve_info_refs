## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Details

A use-after-free was discovered when responding synchronously to

permission requests. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1578](/security/CVE-2016-1578))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2016-1646](/security/CVE-2016-1646))

A use-after-free was discovered in the navigation implementation in

Chromium in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1647](/security/CVE-2016-1647))

A buffer overflow was discovered in ANGLE. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2016-1649](/security/CVE-2016-1649))

An out-of-bounds write was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.

([CVE-2016-1653](/security/CVE-2016-1653))

An invalid read was discovered in the media subsystem in Chromium. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2016-1654](/security/CVE-2016-1654))

It was discovered that frame removal during callback execution could

trigger a use-after-free in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process.

([CVE-2016-1655](/security/CVE-2016-1655))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1659](/security/CVE-2016-1659))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-3679](/security/CVE-2016-3679))

# CVE-2016-1649

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1648.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1650.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1649 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1649)

#### Description

The Program::getUniformInternal function in Program.cpp in libANGLE, as used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.108, does not properly handle a certain data-type mismatch, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted shader stages.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/03/stable-channel-update_24.html "Stable Channel Update")

Thursday, March 24, 2016

The stable channel has been updated to 49.0.2623.108 for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [5 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-2-M49&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$5500][[590284](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=590284)] High CVE-2016-1647: Use-after-free in Navigation. Credit to anonymous.
[$5000][[590455](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=590455)] High CVE-2016-1648: Use-after-free in Extensions. Credit to anonymous.
[[595836](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=595836)] High CVE-2016-1649: Buffer overflow in libANGLE. Credit to lokihardt working with HP’s Zero Day Initiative / Pwn2Own.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[597518](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=597518)] CVE-2016-1650: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.9 branch (currently 4.9.385.33).

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/49.0.2623.87..49.0.2623.108?pretty=fuller&n=10000).
