- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows GET requests to override the HTTP method, which bypasses CSRF protection mechanisms that are designed to only apply to POST requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF protection bypass due to HTTP method overriding.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a user into issuing a request with a different HTTP method than intended, effectively bypassing CSRF protection, leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker misuses GET requests to override HTTP methods
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into making a crafted request to the vulnerable application. The user must be logged in.
