- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. With administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability or compromise legitimate websites to include the malicious content. Users would need to be convinced to view the malicious content, typically through social engineering, such as email or instant messages, or by opening malicious attachments.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website and then convince the user to visit this content using Internet Explorer.
