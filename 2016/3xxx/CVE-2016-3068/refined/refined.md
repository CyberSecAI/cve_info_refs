Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-3068 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Mercurial failed to properly validate Git sub-repository URLs. This allowed for command injection when processing a Mercurial repository that included a Git sub-repository with a specially crafted URL. Specifically, the `git ext::` URL scheme could be used to execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection due to insufficient validation of the Git sub-repository URLs.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The program does not sanitize the input URL, allowing malicious commands to be injected within it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the Mercurial process, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Mercurial Repository:** A malicious actor creates a Mercurial repository that includes a Git sub-repository with a crafted `git ext::` URL.
*   **Cloning Operation:** The victim clones the malicious Mercurial repository using Mercurial. This triggers the vulnerability when Mercurial processes the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious Mercurial repository:** The attacker must be able to create and distribute a Mercurial repository containing a specially crafted Git sub-repository URL.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker relies on a victim cloning the repository, or otherwise processing the malicious repository with Mercurial.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Mercurial versions prior to 3.7.3 are vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** Upgrading to Mercurial 3.7.3 or later fixes the vulnerability, including sanitizing the Git sub-repository URLs to prevent command injection.
*   **CVSS Score:** CVSS v2 base score of 6.8 and CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 which indicates a high severity vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** Multiple Linux distributions and versions are affected, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and openSUSE.
*   **Mitigation:** Patches for this vulnerability were released by various Linux distribution vendors.
*   **Attacker location:** remote attacker.
