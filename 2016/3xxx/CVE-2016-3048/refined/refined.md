- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM OpenPages GRC Platform is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: Embedding malicious JavaScript code within the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the Web UI, and a victim needs to interact with the malicious code.  The attacker would need low privileges (PR:L), and user interaction is required (UI:R).
