Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The XML-RPC system in Drupal allows a large number of calls to the same method to be made at once. This can be exploited for brute-force attacks, such as attempting to guess user passwords by submitting many password variations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Brute-force amplification:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to amplify their brute-force attempts by making numerous calls to an XML-RPC method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Cracking:** Successful exploitation can lead to the cracking of user passwords through brute-force attacks.
*  **Account Compromise:** Compromised accounts could be used for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XML-RPC:** The attack is conducted via the XML-RPC interface of Drupal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make XML-RPC calls to a vulnerable method.
*   The attacker needs to be able to make a large number of calls to the same XML-RPC method.
*  The specific XML-RPC method they exploit must be vulnerable to brute-forcing.
*  An attacker needs to find a vulnerable XML-RPC method, and make many calls to it to amplify a brute-force attack, which can help reveal credentials for user accounts.
* While Drupal 7 core does not include modules with vulnerable methods out of the box, Drupal 6 core is vulnerable via the Blog API module
*   It's noted that flood control mechanisms can mitigate this vulnerability, but the attack can be still possible if those mechanisms are not enabled or are misconfigured.
