Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Trend Micro Mobile Security iOS application (versions 3.1.1034 and below) fails to properly validate the SSL certificate when connecting to the mobile application login server. This is also known as improper certificate validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Missing SSL Certificate Validation:** The application does not verify the authenticity of the SSL certificate presented by the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept communication between the app and the server by presenting a fake SSL certificate.
-   **Data Theft:**  Usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information transmitted between the app and the server can be captured by the attacker.
-   **Unauthorized Access:** Gained information can be used to log in to the application, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and data.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the mobile device and the legitimate server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Network Positioning:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the mobile device and the server, typically through a shared or compromised network (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
-   **Ability to Forge SSL Certificate:** The attacker needs to create and present a malicious SSL certificate to the vulnerable application.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Trend Micro Mobile Security iOS application versions 3.1.1034 and below.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.2.1188.
- The timeline provides dates related to vulnerability disclosure, confirmation, and the release of a fix.
