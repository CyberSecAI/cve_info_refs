Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-3179:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `processRequest` function in `minissdpd.c` does not properly initialize a service structure, leading to a double-free vulnerability during error handling. Specifically, the `newserv` struct fields (e.g., `st`, `usn`, `server`, `location`) are not initialized to NULL after memory allocation. When an error occurs and the code attempts to `free()` these uninitialized pointers, it can result in a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Free:** The primary weakness is the double-free vulnerability. Due to the lack of proper initialization, when the code attempts to free the allocated memory for the service structure and its members within the error handling path, it attempts to free uninitialized pointers, resulting in memory corruption.
*   **Improper Resource Shutdown or Release:** The vulnerability is a consequence of not zeroing out memory and pointers of the service structure before potentially freeing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the `minissdpd` daemon, resulting in a denial of service for any functionality it provides.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted request sent to the Unix socket `/var/run/minissdpd.sock`. This socket is accessible to local unprivileged users.
*   **Crafted Request:** A specific request with a negative length value triggers the vulnerable code path. Specifically, a malformed "new service" request triggers the memory allocation that leads to the error handling path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to interact with the Unix socket.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not require special privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Any local user can send a malformed request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the error handling path within the `processRequest` function of `minissdpd.c`.
*   The `newserv` structure, allocated with `malloc`, isn't initialized. If an error occurs before all struct fields are allocated, the cleanup process at line 753 will attempt to `free()` the uninitialized pointers within `newserv`, leading to the crash.
*   The fix involves using `memset(newserv, 0, sizeof(struct service));` after the `malloc` to initialize the service structure. This ensures all pointers are NULL, preventing the double free issue.
*   The specific input to trigger this vulnerability is a request with type=4 with a specially crafted length field leading to a negative value (e.g., `\x04\x01\x60\x8f\xff\xff\xff\x7f\x0a`).
*   The fix for CVE-2016-3178 also played a part in triggering this vulnerability by causing the execution flow to reach the error handling.
*   The vulnerability exists in `minissdpd` version 1.2.20130907-3 and was fixed in 1.2.20130907-3.2.
