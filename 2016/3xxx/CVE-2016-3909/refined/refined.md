Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Mediaserver component of Android. Specifically, it is related to how the `SoftMPEG4` component handles buffer sizes when writing reference frames. Additionally, the `SoftMPEG4Encoder` had a division by zero vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability. The code was not properly checking the buffer size before writing a reference frame.
*   **Division by Zero:** A division-by-zero error was present in the SoftMPEG4Encoder when certain parameters would be set to zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process (Mediaserver). This could lead to gaining local access to elevated capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the Android device.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the specific vulnerable code paths in Mediaserver to trigger the buffer overflow or the division-by-zero error.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix for this issue involved checking the buffer size before writing the reference frame and preventing the division by zero in `SoftMPEG4Encoder`.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity due to the possibility of a local attacker gaining elevated access.
