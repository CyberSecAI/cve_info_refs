Message-ID: <20160406205435.GA10611@mail.corp.redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 6 Apr 2016 16:54:36 -0400
From: Randy Barlow <rbarlow@...hat.com>
To: OSS Security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
Subject: Pulp 2.8.2 release for CVE-2016-3095

CVE-2016-3095 was discovered in Pulp's pulp-gen-ca-certificate script.
This script generates the CA certificate that Pulp uses to sign client
certificates during the /login call. The private key was created in a
world-readable folder in /tmp, and was then moved to its final
destination where a chmod operation would protect it. This created a
brief window where a local attacker could read the CA key before it
was put into use.

This script is run during the installation of Pulp by the RPM post
script,
and can also be run by users any time they wish to regenerate the CA
certificate.

The fix was a single line adjustment that sets the mode on the folder
in /tmp to be 0700 instead of 0755:

<https://github.com/pulp/pulp/commit/>
9f969b94c4b4f310865455d36db207de6cffebca#diff-
fc698b450b32a4d811f269e108ade790R33

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the 2.8.2 release, and then re-
run the pulp-gen-ca-certificate script to generate a new CA. It is
advised to restart all Pulp processes (and httpd) after the new CA is in
place. After this is done, any existing client certificates will be
invalidated, so users will need to use pulp-admin login to generate
new credentials.

Users who do not use Pulp's client certificate authentication system
are not affected.

Thanks to Adam Mariš for advising the Pulp team through the
disclosure process, and to Sean Myers for a speedy code review and
for performing the release process.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c0)  Randy Barlow    2013-09-01 22:07:24 UTC  ``` I learned during our refactor this weekend that we have ca.{crt,key} files in our git repository that our RPM packages and installs on every Pulp installation. This is very bad.  To make matters worse, there is only a tiny paragraph in our docs that mention quite casually that you should make your own SSL certificates. This is putting our users at risk, particularly ones who don't know the full depths of our use of CA certificates. This is particularly bad due to the understated nature of the documentation telling users that they can change the CA if they want to.  A very easy solution would be to have the %post% section of our spec file autogenerate a new CA certificate and key when the package is installed. This has the benefit of still making it easy to install Pulp for newcomers, while also not putting those users at risk to man in the middle attacks. It's still exactly the same effort for the user to install their own CA, if they wish.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c1)  Jeff Ortel    2013-09-19 23:07:40 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/627>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c2)  Jeff Ortel    2013-09-26 15:36:36 UTC  ``` build: 2.3.0-0.15.alpha   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c3)  Preethi Thomas    2013-09-30 12:54:50 UTC  ``` verified [root@pulp-v2-server ~]# rpm -qa pulp-server pulp-server-2.3.0-0.16.alpha.el6.noarch [root@pulp-v2-server ~]#   [root@pulp-v2-server ~]# ls -l /etc/pki/pulp/ total 20 -rw-r-----. 1 root   apache 1082 Sep 27 08:33 ca.crt -rw-r-----. 1 root   apache 1675 Sep 27 08:33 ca.key drwxr-xr-x. 2 apache apache 4096 Sep 26 16:44 content drwxr-xr-x. 2 root   root   4096 Sep 27 09:52 nodes drwxr-xr-x. 3 root   root   4096 Sep 19 15:03 qpid [root@pulp-v2-server ~]#   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c4)  Preethi Thomas    2013-12-09 14:31:29 UTC  ``` Pulp 2.3 released.   ``` |  |

From: Randy Barlow <rbarlow@...hat.com>
To: Pulp Users <pulp-list@...hat.com>,
        OSS Security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
Subject: CVE-2013-7450: Pulp < 2.3.0 distributed the same CA key to all users

Versions of Pulp < 2.3.0 distributed the same certificate authority key and
certificate to all Pulp users[0]. This CA is used by the /login API call
(pulp-admin login uses this call) to generate and sign a client certificate.
This client certificate is then used for subsequent API calls.

Due to this vulnerability, remote attackers are able to obtain the CA key
from the Pulp git repository and use it to generate valid client certificates
for any Pulp installations that use the default CA. The Pulp documentation
did not emphasize the importance of replacing this CA for production
deployments, so there may be users who use this common CA key in production
environments.

Users are urged to replace the CA certificate and key on any Pulp
installations that began their life with a version less than 2.3.0. Upgrading
alone is not sufficient, as Pulp upgrades do not replace existing CA key
pairs. Versions of Pulp >= 2.3.0 do ship a utility (pulp-gen-ca-certificate)
that is capable of generating a new CA keypair for you, but it should be
noted that there are some known local attacks that this script is vulnerable
to as well[1][2]. The best option is to generate your own CA certificate if
you are concerned about these local attacks.

Thanks to Sander Bos for notifying the Pulp team that we had neglected to
acquire a CVE for this vulnerability at the time of its discovery.

**Description**

The pulp-gen-ca-certificate script created

the Pulp CA certificate and key in /tmp/$RANDOM. This led to about

32,768 possible directories. Florian Weimer and Sander Bos

notified the Pulp team that if a user happened to own a directory

that the script chose, the user would be able to read the

certificate authority certificate. Additionally, both security

researchers concluded that there is a race condition between

creating the secure folder and the later chmod, during which an

attacker could read and hold open the inode for the $TMP

directory. This would allow an attacker to read the key that is

later written.

Sander Bos additionally concluded that an attacker could create a

DoS attack two ways: 0) By creating a symlink within the $TMP

directory that points at an important system resource, such as

/etc/passwd, or 1) By creating $TMP itself as a symlink to /,

which would cause / to be chmod'd to 0700 later in the script.

The fix adjusts the script to use mktemp -d to ensure that a

unique and safe directory is used to create the Pulp CA

certificate. Additionally, the script uses set -e so that it will

halt if there are errors.

Thanks to Florian Weimer and to Sander Bos for independently

notifying Pulp of the issue and for suggesting the needed changes

to fix it. Thanks to Adam Mariš for advising the Pulp team through

the fix. The Pulp team is thankful to the security community for

their thoughtful analysis, and for taking the time to report these

issues.

Safely create the dir in which the CA is created (CVE-2016-3106).

Prior to this commit, the pulp-gen-ca-certificate script created
the Pulp CA certificate and key in /tmp/$RANDOM. This led to about
32,768 possible directories. Florian Weimer and Sander Bos
notified the Pulp team that if a user happened to own a directory
that the script chose, the user would be able to read the
certificate authority certificate. Additionally, both security
researchers concluded that there is a race condition between
creating the secure folder and the later chmod, during which an
attacker could read and hold open the inode for the $TMP
directory. This would allow an attacker to read the key that is
later written.

Sander Bos additionally concluded that an attacker could create a
DoS attack two ways: 0) By creating a symlink within the $TMP
directory that points at an important system resource, such as
/etc/passwd, or 1) By creating $TMP itself as a symlink to /,
which would cause / to be chmod'd to 0700 later in the script.

This commit adjusts the script to use mktemp -d to ensure that a
unique and safe directory is used to create the Pulp CA
certificate. Additionally, the script uses set -e so that it will
halt if there are errors.

Thanks to Florian Weimer and to Sander Bos for independently
notifying Pulp of the issue and for suggesting the needed changes
to fix it. Thanks to Adam Mariš for advising the Pulp team through
the fix. The Pulp team is thankful to the security community for
their thoughtful analysis, and for taking the time to report these
issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1322706#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-03-31 07:48:56 UTC  ``` It was found that newly generated CA keys by running pulp-gen-ca-certificate (which is run by spec file when pulp is installed) script are insufficiently protected against reading by other users for the time the script runs.  Vulnerable code:  <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/2.8.0/server/bin/pulp-gen-ca-certificate>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1322706#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-03-31 07:49:06 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Randy Barlow (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1322706#c2)  Randy Barlow    2016-03-31 14:41:54 UTC  ``` This upstream pull request fixes this issue and also raises the size of the default CA key:  <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/2503>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1322706#c3)  Mike McCune    2016-03-31 15:17:43 UTC  ``` Satellite 6's use of Pulp does not utilize certificate based authentication to Pulp's API, we only authenticate via OAuth so it appears that our product is not vulnerable to this CVE.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1322706#c4)  Mike McCune    2016-03-31 15:18:42 UTC  ``` IRC conversation with Randy for a bit more details:  <bowlofeggs> do you know if katello/satellite uses pulp's internal cacert or not?
