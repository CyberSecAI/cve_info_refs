  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3222",
    "description": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Microsoft Edge when the CBaseScriptable::PrivateQueryInterface method is called with a crafted object. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Microsoft Edge",
	  "Chakra JavaScript engine"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a type confusion or bad cast within the `CBaseScriptable::PrivateQueryInterface` method when handling objects in memory in the Chakra JavaScript engine. This leads to reading of uninitialized data from a memory location.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption"
	  "Type confusion/bad cast",
      "Uninitialized memory read"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution with the same user rights as the current user. An attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights if the current user has administrative privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack: An attacker hosts a specially crafted web page designed to exploit the vulnerability, then convinces the user to view the web page using Microsoft Edge.",
      "Compromised website/advertising network: An attacker injects the malicious page into a compromised website or advertisement network.",
	  "Embedding an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to host or inject a malicious web page",
	  "User interaction is required: Target user must open the specially crafted webpage"
    ],
	"additional_details": [
		"Disabling Javascript does not prevent triggering of the vulnerable code path.",
        "The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, initially misidentified as a null pointer dereference, then correctly identified as memory corruption due to reading uninitialized memory.",
		"The vulnerability affects both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Edge but the specific behavior and addresses where crashes occur can vary."
