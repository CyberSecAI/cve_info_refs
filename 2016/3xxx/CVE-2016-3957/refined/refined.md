  "CVE-2016-3957": {
    "description": "There are two vulnerabilities in sample code. A production server contained default applications could cause Remote Code Execution attack. The official site (web2py.com) is also affected.",
    "root_cause": "The web2py framework, in its default configuration, uses Pickle to serialize session cookies. This, combined with a hardcoded encryption key, allows attackers to forge malicious session cookies, leading to arbitrary code execution when the server deserializes the data using `pickle.loads`.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization using pickle",
        "Use of a hardcoded encryption key"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting a malicious session cookie.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious session cookie to a vulnerable web2py application.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the hardcoded encryption key (`yoursecret`) or be able to obtain it from an information leak to forge the session cookie. No authentication is needed by default as default applications are exposed by default.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present because web2py uses Pickle for session cookie serialization, which is susceptible to code execution if the serialized data is crafted to execute arbitrary code. The `secure_loads` function in `gluon/utils.py`, which deserializes session data, uses pickle.loads after decryption and signature verification. The default applications in web2py use a hardcoded encryption key for cookies, making it easier to exploit."
