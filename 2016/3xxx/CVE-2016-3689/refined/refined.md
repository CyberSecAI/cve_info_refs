      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of USB device descriptors within the Linux kernel's ims-pcu driver.

        "Physically proximate attacker inserting a malicious USB device"
      ],
       "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs physical access to the system and the ability to provide a malicious USB device."
