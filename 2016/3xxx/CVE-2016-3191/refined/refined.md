Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `compile_branch` function within the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library improperly handles patterns that contain a `(*ACCEPT)` substring along with deeply nested parentheses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow, which occurs due to the mishandling of the `(*ACCEPT)` substring in the presence of deeply nested parentheses during pattern compilation.
*   **Insufficient Validation:** PCRE fails to validate if the processing of the `(*ACCEPT)` verb happens within the bounds of the allocated stack buffer (`cworkspace`). This lack of validation allows the overflow to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system by crafting a malicious regular expression.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition, causing the affected application to crash.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Due to buffer overflow, memory corruption can also occur.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Regular Expression:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted regular expression containing the `(*ACCEPT)` substring and nested parentheses.
*   **Remote Attackers:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker by submitting a malicious regular expression through an affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Submit Crafted Regex:** Attackers need to be able to submit a crafted regular expression string to an application utilizing the vulnerable PCRE library.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Most of the identified instances show that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   PCRE versions 8.x before 8.39.
    *   PCRE2 versions before 10.22.
*   **Exploitation Examples:** The vulnerability has been demonstrated using a crafted JavaScript RegExp object as an attack vector, specifically in Konqueror, and also by other methods through the processing of regular expression patterns.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading to a patched version of PCRE (8.39 or later for PCRE and 10.22 or later for PCRE2) is the recommended mitigation. Red Hat also issued RHSA-2016:1025 and RHSA-2016:1132 and related errata to address this vulnerability.
