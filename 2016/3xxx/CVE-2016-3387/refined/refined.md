{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3387",
    "description": "Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer or Edge fails to properly secure private namespace. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated permissions on the namespace directory of a vulnerable system and gain elevated privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer and Edge failing to properly secure private namespace boundaries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure boundary descriptor for the isolated private namespace.",
       "The function in most cases first calls OpenPrivateNamespace before falling back to CreatePrivateNamespace."
       ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain elevated permissions on the namespace directory and gain elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could create the namespace prior to Edge/IE starting, ensuring the directory and other objects created underneath are accessible.",
       "The per-user namespace IEUser_USERSID_MicrosoftEdge is trivially guessable."
        ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create the namespace before the Edge/IE process starts. This could be done from another sandbox application or from another user on the same system.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability itself does not allow arbitrary code execution, but when combined with other vulnerabilities such as remote code execution, it could allow the attacker to take advantage of the elevated privileges to compromise the system. The issue is caused by the insecure naming and handling of private namespaces."
