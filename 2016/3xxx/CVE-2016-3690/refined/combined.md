# How to restrict jmx invoker to localhost in JBoss EAP?

Solution Verified
- Updated 2024-08-07T05:49:11+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

## Environment

* Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform(EAP)
  + 4.x
  + 5.x
* Red Hat JBoss SOA-Platform (SOA-P)
  + 4.x
  + 5.x

## Issue

* In order to secure the jmx invoker, access needs to be restricted to localhost. How can this be configured ?

## Resolution

**EAP 4.x and SOA-P 4.x**

Binding the JMX invoker to localhost - **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**:

It is recommended that the jmx-invoker be bound specifically to localhost only. Do it as follows:

In `$JBOSS_HOME/server/$PROFILE/conf/jboss-service.xml`, look for RMI/JRMP invoker section and update `ServerAddress` to be `localhost`. The section should then look something like:

```
    <!-- RMI/JRMP invoker -->
    <mbean code="org.jboss.invocation.jrmp.server.JRMPInvoker"
       name="jboss:service=invoker,type=jrmp">
       <attribute name="RMIObjectPort">4444</attribute>
       <attribute name="ServerAddress">localhost</attribute>
       ....

```

In `$JBOSS_HOME/server/$PROFILE/deploy/jmx-invoker-service.xml`, add the following lines inside the `<server>` section:

```
    <!-- A pooled invoker bound to localhost -->
    <mbean code="org.jboss.invocation.pooled.server.PooledInvoker"
       name="jboss:service=invoker,type=pooled,host=localhost">
       <attribute name="NumAcceptThreads">1</attribute>
       <attribute name="MaxPoolSize">300</attribute>
       <attribute name="ClientMaxPoolSize">300</attribute>
       <attribute name="SocketTimeout">60000</attribute>
       <attribute name="ServerBindAddress">localhost</attribute>
       <attribute name="ServerBindPort">4443</attribute>
       <attribute name="ClientConnectAddress">localhost</attribute>
       <attribute name="ClientConnectPort">0</attribute>
       <attribute name="ClientRetryCount">1</attribute>
       <attribute name="EnableTcpNoDelay">false</attribute>
       <depends  optional-attribute-name="TransactionManagerService">jboss:service=TransactionManager</depends>

```

**EAP 5.x and SOA-P 5.x**

In JBoss EAP 5, the MBeans `org.jboss.invocation.jrmp.server.JRMPInvoker` and `org.jboss.invocation.pooled.server.PooledInvoker` are defined in `$JBOSS_HOME/server/$PROFILE/deploy/legacy-invokers-service.xml`:

```
   <!-- RMI/JRMP invoker -->
   <mbean code="org.jboss.invocation.jrmp.server.JRMPInvoker"
      name="jboss:service=invoker,type=jrmp">
      <attribute name="RMIObjectPort">
         <value-factory bean="ServiceBindingManager" method="getIntBinding" parameter="jboss:service=invoker,type=jrmp"/>
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="ServerAddress">
         <value-factory bean="ServiceBindingManager" method="getStringBinding" parameter="jboss:service=invoker,type=jrmp"/>
      </attribute>
      ...

   <mbean code="org.jboss.invocation.pooled.server.PooledInvoker"
      name="jboss:service=invoker,type=pooled">
      <attribute name="NumAcceptThreads">1</attribute>
      <attribute name="MaxPoolSize">300</attribute>
      <attribute name="ClientMaxPoolSize">300</attribute>
      <attribute name="SocketTimeout">300000</attribute>
      <attribute name="ServerBindAddress">
         <value-factory bean="ServiceBindingManager" method="getStringBinding" parameter="jboss:service=invoker,type=pooled"/>
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="ServerBindPort">
         <value-factory bean="ServiceBindingManager" method="getIntBinding" parameter="jboss:service=invoker,type=pooled"/>
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="ClientConnectAddress">
         <value-factory bean="ServiceBindingManager" method="getStringBinding" parameter="jboss:service=invoker,type=pooled"/>
      </attribute>
      ...

```

There are 2 options to bind them to localhost:

* **Option 1** is to change the Service Binding Manager configuration in `$JBOSS_HOME/server/$PROFILE/conf/bindingservice.beans/META-INF/bindings-jboss-beans.xml`

  + Add the properties `hostName` and `fixedHostName` to each invoker as shown below
  + The `hostName` tells it to use `localhost` for the host
  + The `fixedHostName` = `true` tells it to always use `localhost` regardless of which `jboss.service.binding.set` the customer uses

    ```
                <!-- ********************* deploy/legacy-invokers-service.xml ****************** -->

                <!-- RMI/JRMP invoker -->
                <bean class="org.jboss.services.binding.ServiceBindingMetadata">
                   <property name="serviceName">jboss:service=invoker,type=jrmp</property>
                   <property name="port">4444</property>
                   <property name="description">Socket for the legacy RMI/JRMP invoker</property>
                   <property name="hostName">localhost</property>
                   <property name="fixedHostName">true</property>
                </bean>

                <!-- Pooled invoker -->
                <bean class="org.jboss.services.binding.ServiceBindingMetadata">
                   <property name="serviceName">jboss:service=invoker,type=pooled</property>
                   <property name="port">4445</property>
                   <property name="description">Socket for the legacy Pooled invoker</property>
                   <property name="hostName">localhost</property>
                   <property name="fixedHostName">true</property>
                </bean>

    ```
* **Option 2** is to remove the `<value-factor-bean...` in the `ServerAddress`, `ServerBindAddress`, and `ClientConnectAddress` and replace them with `localhost`. Option is recommended to keep the configuration all in one place.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1327037#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2016-04-14 07:10:27 UTC  ``` The HA Pooled Invoker allows unauthorised access, and deserializes any payload sent to it.  This is one of the attack vectors for [CVE-2015-7501](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-7501). There are many new gadget chains available in the ysoserial project. For example the Beanshell library could be used to create a malicious serialized object. When deserialized by the HA Pooled Invoker servlet allows remote code execution.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1327037#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2016-04-14 07:13:33 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Dennis Reed (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1327037#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2016-05-09 02:13:46 UTC  ``` Any KCS already published on the topic: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/45530>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1327037#c7)  Jason Shepherd    2016-05-09 02:20:13 UTC  ``` Need to update Installation Guides with WARNING about unsecured Invokers, and linked to the KCS Solution 45530   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1327037#c10)  Jason Shepherd    2016-08-19 06:34:43 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The PooledInvokerServlet is no longer required and can be removed by following the details in this knowledgebase solution: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/178393>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1327037#c12)  Jason Shepherd    2016-10-16 22:18:18 UTC  ``` A proactive notification was sent to customer on 7th October.   ``` |  |
