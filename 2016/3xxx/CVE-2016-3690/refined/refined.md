{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `PooledInvokerServlet` in JBoss EAP is not secured and deserializes data received from remote clients. This allows for the possibility of remote code execution if a malicious serialized object is sent to the servlet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Lack of authentication/authorization on `PooledInvokerServlet`",
      "Exposed JMX invoker on all network interfaces"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) on the server running JBoss EAP by sending malicious serialized data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the `PooledInvokerServlet` via a vulnerable port (4445 by default).",
      "Sending a crafted serialized payload to the vulnerable endpoint."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable port on the JBoss EAP server. No authentication is required by default, allowing any network-connected attacker to attempt exploitation."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 4.x",
    "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 5.x",
    "Red Hat JBoss SOA-Platform (SOA-P) 4.x",
    "Red Hat JBoss SOA-Platform (SOA-P) 5.x"
  ],
    "additional_details": "The provided content gives specific instructions on how to mitigate this vulnerability, including binding the JMX invoker to localhost, and disabling the Pooled Invoker MBean. It also references the use of `ysoserial` to create malicious serialized objects.",
    "resolution": [
        "Bind the JMX invoker to localhost.",
        "Remove the PooledInvoker MBean in `$JBOSS_HOME/server/$PROFILE/deploy/legacy-invokers-service.xml`",
        "Alternatively, change the Service Binding Manager configuration to bind the invoker to localhost in `$JBOSS_HOME/server/$PROFILE/conf/bindingservice.beans/META-INF/bindings-jboss-beans.xml`."
