- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw within the WebSphere Application Server Liberty OpenID Connect clients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is susceptible to cross-site scripting. Specifically, it allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Altered intended functionality of the web UI.
    - Potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the WebSphere Application Server Liberty OpenID Connect clients. This would require a user to interact with the malicious payload, hence user interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into the context of the vulnerable OpenID Connect clients within the WebSphere Application Server Liberty.
