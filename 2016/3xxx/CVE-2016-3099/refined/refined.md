  "CVE-2016-3099": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way mod_nss parsed certain OpenSSL-style cipher strings. As a result, mod_nss could potentially use ciphers that were not intended to be enabled.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The mod_nss module incorrectly parsed OpenSSL-style cipher strings, specifically not handling the `+` operator as expected.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Improper parsing of cipher strings",
           "Incorrect logic when handling +CIPHER operator"
        ],
      "impact": "mod_nss could potentially use ciphers that were not intended to be enabled, potentially weakening the security of encrypted connections.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially influence the cipher selection by providing a specially crafted cipher string, if the configuration of mod_nss allows it.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to control or influence the cipher string being processed by mod_nss, which is typically configured by the server administrator. No specific attacker position is required, but the attacker needs to be able to cause a connection using the flawed cipher settings."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "mod_nss module for Apache HTTP Server"
    ],
      "additional_notes": "The bugzilla entries mention a fix that rebased mod_nss to version 1.0.14. The fix addresses the improper parsing logic, which could result in unexpected or insecure ciphers being used. The Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2016:2602 provides information on the fix, its impact, and how to apply it, which involves restarting the httpd service. This vulnerability was discovered by Rob Crittenden."
