Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3863:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the AVCC reassembler.
- The use of a variable length array, which is non-standard in C++, was removed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: A buffer on the stack can be overflowed by providing a crafted input during AVCC reassembly.
- Non-standard C++ usage: Variable length arrays are not standard, and can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other critical data, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the context of an unprivileged process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Specially crafted media file: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a crafted media file. The processing of such file by MediaMuxer leads to the stack overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted media file: An attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted file to the vulnerable MediaMuxer process. This could be done through various means, such as a malicious application or a compromised service.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `MediaMuxer` component, specifically within the AVCC reassembly logic.
- The fix involved removing the non-standard variable length array and addressing the stack overflow issue.
- The CVE is rated as High severity due to the possibility of remote code execution in an application that uses MediaMuxer.
