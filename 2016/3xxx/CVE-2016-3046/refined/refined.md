- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in IBM Security Access Manager appliances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing a remote attacker to inject malicious SQL statements.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack could allow the attacker to view information in the back-end database.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send specially-crafted SQL statements to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system. The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) which is unusual for SQL injection, but this might be related to the affected software.
