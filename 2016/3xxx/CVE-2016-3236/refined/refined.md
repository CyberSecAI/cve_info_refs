Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-3236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Windows improperly handles certain proxy discovery scenarios when using the Web Proxy Auto Discovery (WPAD) protocol. Specifically, when WPAD falls back to a vulnerable proxy discovery process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Proxy Discovery:** Windows does not correctly manage the process of discovering proxy servers using WPAD. This leads to a flaw where an attacker can intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to potentially gain access to and control network traffic that they should not have privileges to access. This is considered an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker could exploit this by positioning themselves to intercept WPAD requests and provide malicious proxy configurations, gaining control over the victim's network traffic.
*   The attacker exploits the WPAD automatic proxy detection in Windows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim or be able to intercept network traffic, and provide malicious responses to WPAD requests.
*  The attacker must be able to respond to WPAD requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Windows handles WPAD automatic proxy detection.
*   A workaround for this vulnerability is provided, which involves stopping WPAD by using a host file entry. This workaround impacts autoproxy discovery, preventing some applications from loading websites properly.
* The vulnerability is publicly disclosed.
