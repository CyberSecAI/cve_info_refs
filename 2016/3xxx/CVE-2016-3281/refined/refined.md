- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Office software's failure to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain control of the affected system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by convincing a user to open a specially crafted file, either via email or through a malicious website. The Preview Pane in affected applications can also serve as an attack vector for this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim and convince them to open it. In a web-based attack, they would need to host or compromise a website to host the malicious file.
