Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3211:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, specifically during drag-and-drop operations via the `IShdocvwBroker::PerformDoDragDrop` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** Improper memory access during drag-and-drop operations leads to memory corruption.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** An attacker who has already achieved code execution within the Internet Explorer Protected Mode sandbox can leverage this vulnerability to escape the sandbox.
*   **Arbitrary File Placement:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to place a malicious executable file in any location to which the user has write access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Integrity):** An attacker can execute code at medium integrity, which are the permissions of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain control of the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted webpage that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convinces a user to view the website.
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker could convince a user to open a malicious file.
*   **Compromised Websites:**  An attacker could take advantage of compromised websites or websites that accept or host user-provided content by adding specially crafted content that exploits the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Initial Code Execution:** The attacker needs to have already gained code execution within the Internet Explorer Protected Mode sandbox. This implies a prior compromise or another vulnerability used to gain initial access.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The attacker has no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. They must convince users to take action.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Important" for Windows clients and "Low" for Windows servers, according to Microsoft's severity rating.
*   Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
