- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a design flaw in IBM Cognos TM1 where it provides a service to return the victim's password with a valid session key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure handling of session keys leading to potential exposure of user passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive user password data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system or sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending requests to the service using a valid session key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have a valid session key, and user interaction is required.
