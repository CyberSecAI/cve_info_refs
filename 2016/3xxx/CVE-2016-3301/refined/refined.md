Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `gdiplus!DecodeCompressedRLEBitmap` function in the GDI+ library, specifically when handling bitmaps compressed with the BI_RLE8 (8-bit Run-Length Encoding) algorithm. The function calculates the size of the output buffer based on bitmap dimensions. In 32-bit Large Address Aware programs, the pointer arithmetic used to increment the output pointer (`out_ptr += bytes_per_row;`) can overflow the 32-bit address space limit (0xFFFFFFFF). This results in the `out_ptr` becoming a small invalid address, while still passing the size check against `output_buffer_end`, leading to an out-of-bounds write when data is written to this invalid pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Integer overflow in pointer arithmetic: The signed 32-bit addition `out_ptr += bytes_per_row` can result in an overflow, causing the pointer to wrap around to a small invalid address, while the check `out_ptr > output_buffer_end` does not detect the invalid address
- Out-of-bounds write: Writing to the calculated `out_ptr` address, which is outside the allocated buffer leads to memory corruption and potentially remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can potentially gain control of the affected system by exploiting the out-of-bounds write, which allows for the injection of malicious code.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds write can cause a crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Specially crafted bitmaps within EMF files: Bitmaps embedded in EMF records (EMR_PLGBLT, EMR_BITBLT, EMR_STRETCHBLT, EMR_STRETCHDIBITS, etc.) can trigger the vulnerable code path.
- Specially crafted documents or websites: Attackers could embed malicious EMF files in documents or host them on websites, enticing users to open the document or visit the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to create a specially crafted EMF file containing a bitmap with specific parameters: The attacker must be able to control the `biWidth`, `biHeight`, `biPlanes`, and `biBitCount` fields in the bitmap header to trigger the integer overflow.
- Ability to deliver the malicious EMF file to the target: This can be done via email attachments, malicious websites, file sharing etc
- Target must use a 32-bit Large Address Aware program: The vulnerability relies on the address space overflow that can occur in 32-bit large address aware programs.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Microsoft products, including Windows, Microsoft Office, Skype for Business, and Lync.
- The provided exploit example uses an EMF file with specific dimensions and RLE encoding, triggering the overflow and out-of-bounds write.
- The exploitability is dependent on the state of the process address space while loading the image and the specific testcase may not lead to a crash on all GDI+ clients.
- The vulnerability is present in the GDI+ library (gdiplus.dll).
- The issue can occur in programs built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 for x86 platform with the `/LARGEADDRESSAWARE` flag set.
- This CVE was addressed in the August 2016 Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS16-097).
