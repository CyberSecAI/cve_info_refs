- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver leads to an elevation of privilege vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, which could lead to installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the system.
