    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3221",
      "description": "Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Elevation of Privilege"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker would first have to log on to the target system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control over an affected system.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker requires the ability to log on to the target system, and the ability to execute a specially crafted application."
