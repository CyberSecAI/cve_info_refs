Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3834:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to how camera pointers are being routed through the application process. Specifically, the issue involves adjusting pointers to ANW (Android Native Window) buffers. The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly handle and validate these pointers, potentially exposing memory containing sensitive information. It involves a random static object whose address was being routed through app processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability. By not properly handling the pointers to ANW buffers, a malicious application can gain access to memory regions and data structures that it should not have access to.
-   **Pointer Mishandling:** The core problem lies in how pointers are passed and used, leading to the potential for accessing incorrect memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Exposure:** A local malicious application could potentially read sensitive information that is not within its permission boundaries. This may include camera related data or other information stored in the affected memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector is a local malicious application installed on the Android device. This application can exploit the vulnerability through the camera APIs and related services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Installation:** The attacker needs to be able to install and run a malicious application on the targeted device.
-   **Camera API Interaction:** The malicious application must be able to interact with the camera API in a manner that triggers the vulnerability.
