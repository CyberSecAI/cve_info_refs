Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-3161:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unquoted service path vulnerability in Windows for GFE GameStream and NVTray Plugin services.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The services are installed with unquoted paths, which allows an attacker to insert malicious executables in the path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows malicious code execution on the system at the system/user privilege level.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required, where an attacker needs to place a malicious executable in a path that is part of an unquoted service path, before the legitimate executable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to write files into directories within the service path. A low-privileged user can perform this.
