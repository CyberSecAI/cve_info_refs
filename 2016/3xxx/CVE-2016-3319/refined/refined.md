Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-3319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Windows PDF Library improperly handles objects in memory. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption, which an attacker can exploit to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory by the Microsoft Windows PDF Library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.
- Complete system control: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take full control of the affected system.
- Potential for malicious actions: An attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack:
  - For Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge as the default browser, attackers can host a specially crafted website containing malicious PDF content. When a user visits the website, the exploit can be triggered without any further user interaction, potentially compromising the system directly.
  - For other operating systems, attackers can host the malicious PDF on compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.
- Document-based attack:
   -  Attackers can convince users to open a specially crafted PDF document, usually delivered through email attachments or enticements in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious PDF file, either on a website or as a file for distribution.
- Ability to convince the user to either visit the malicious website or open the malicious PDF document. This typically involves social engineering tactics.
