{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3247",
  "description": "Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge access objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Internet Explorer 9",
    "Internet Explorer 10",
    "Internet Explorer 11",
    "Microsoft Edge"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer underflow in `CTextExtractor::GetBlockText` when processing a specially crafted webpage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Corruption",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the same privileges as the current user. If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker could take control of the system, install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit a specially crafted web page using a vulnerable browser or open a malicious email attachment.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must host a specially crafted webpage or send a specially crafted file to the victim. No special position is required."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists in both Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. The exploit-db entry provides a proof of concept that demonstrates an out-of-bounds read in Microsoft Edge by using a heap spray technique to allocate memory at a large offset from the initial buffer. This allows the attacker to control the data that is being read out of bounds, which, in turn could be used for further exploitation."
