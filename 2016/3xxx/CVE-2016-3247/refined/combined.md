## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3183038)

Published: September 13, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Internet Explorer handles:

* zone and integrity settings.
* cross-origin content.
* objects in memory.
* .URL files.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3183038](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3183038).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically via an enticement in email or instant message, or by getting them to open an email attachment.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| \*\*Vulnerability title                                                                                                              \*\* | \*\*CVE number           \*\* | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability CVE-2016-3375

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine in Internet Explorer access objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically via an enticement in email or instant message, or by getting them to open an email attachment.

Note that you must install two updates to be protected from the Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability CVE-2016-3375: The update in this bulletin, MS16-104, and the update in [MS16-116](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=825725). The updates address the vulnerability by modifying how the Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine in Internet Explorer handle objects in memory.

## Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability CVE-2016-3292

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer fails a check, allowing sandbox escape. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use the sandbox escape to elevate privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with one or more vulnerabilities (such as a remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution is attempted.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Internet Explorer handles zone and integrity settings.

## Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability CVE-2016-3325

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the affected components handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise a target system.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

## Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability CVE-2016-3291

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that affected Microsoft browsers handle cross-origin requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could determine the origin of all of the web pages in the affected browser.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how affected browsers handle cross-origin resources.

## Internet Explorer Security Feature Bypass - CVE-2016-3353

A security feature bypass opportunity exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles files from the Internet zone.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a malicious website that is designed to exploit the security feature bypass. Alternatively, in an email or instant message attack scenario, the attacker could send the targeted user a specially crafted .URL file that is designed to exploit the bypass. Additionally, compromised websites or websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the security feature bypass. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could entice users into clicking a link that directs them to the attacker's site or send a malicious attachment.

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3183038)

Published: September 13, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Internet Explorer handles:

* zone and integrity settings.
* cross-origin content.
* objects in memory.
* .URL files.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically via an enticement in email or instant message, or by getting them to open an email attachment.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| \*\*Vulnerability title                                                                                                              \*\* | \*\*CVE number           \*\* | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability CVE-2016-3375

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine in Internet Explorer access objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically via an enticement in email or instant message, or by getting them to open an email attachment.

Note that you must install two updates to be protected from the Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability CVE-2016-3375: The update in this bulletin, MS16-104, and the update in [MS16-116](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=825725). The updates address the vulnerability by modifying how the Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine in Internet Explorer handle objects in memory.

Yes. Although protecting Windows 10 systems from CVE-2016-3375 requires no additional steps other than installing the September Windows 10 cumulative update, for all other affected operating systems installing the 3185319 cumulative update by itself does not fully protect against CVE-2016-3375 â you must also install security update 3184122 in [MS16-116](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=825725) to be fully protected from the vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability CVE-2016-3292

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer fails a check, allowing sandbox escape. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use the sandbox escape to elevate privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with one or more vulnerabilities (such as a remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution is attempted.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Internet Explorer handles zone and integrity settings.

## Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability CVE-2016-3325

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the affected components handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise a target system.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

## Internet Explorer Security Feature Bypass - CVE-2016-3353

A security feature bypass opportunity exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles files from the Internet zone.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a malicious website that is designed to exploit the security feature bypass. Alternatively, in an email or instant message attack scenario, the attacker could send the targeted user a specially crafted .URL file that is designed to exploit the bypass. Additionally, compromised websites or websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the security feature bypass. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could entice users into clicking a link that directs them to the attacker's site or send a malicious attachment.

Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause an integer underflow in Microsoft Edge. This causes CText­Extractor::Get­Block­Text to read data outside of the bounds of a memory block.

Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations

Microsoft Edge 11.0.10240.16384

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Java­Script is not necessarily required to trigger the issue.

Description

Though I did not investigate thoroughly, I did find out the following:

The root cause appears to be an integer underflow in a 32-bit variable used in CText­Extractor..Get­Block­Text as an index to read a WCHAR in a string buffer. This index is decreased once too often and becomes -1, or a very large positive number depending on how it is used.
This does not result in a crash on 32-bit systems, as an integer wrap causes the code to read one WCHAR before the start of the buffer, which is normally also in allocated memory.
On 64-bit systems, the 32-bit -1 value is interpreted as 0x­FFFFFFFF, a very large positive value. As this is an index into a WCHAR string, it gets multiplied by two and added to the start of the buffer to find the location of a WCHAR to read. This causes the OOB read to be around 8Gb (!!) beyond the address at which the buffer is allocated.
The crash happens in code that appears to be rendering the web-page, which does not immediately offer an obvious way of extracting information using this bug.

Exploit

This is where it gets interesting, as the OOB read happens approximately 0x2`00000000 bytes after the address at which the buffer is allocated. This presents us with a problem: how to store some information that we'd be interested in reading at such a large offset from the original allocation?

As one might come to expect from me, I used a heap spray. But it needed to be a special kind of heap spray as I did not want to actually have to allocate 8Gb of RAM. However, about ten years ago (boy, time flies!) I developed a heap spray that uses significantly less RAM than a traditional heap spray does; in practice probably about 33% in most cases, but theoretically much more in ideal situations. I've been meaning to blog about it, but never found the time to do so until today: you can read all about it here.

That said, I have not actually looked at whether it is possible to exfiltrate useful information using this bug. However, I did write a Proof-of-Concept that attempts to make sure something is allocated in the area where the OOB read happens. This Po­C uses these heap spray tricks to spray the heap while minimizing memory use. The Proof-of-Concept uses about ~5.3Gb to allocate the memory at around 8Gb distance from the buffer (up to ~10Gb to be sure). When you load the Po­C in a 64-bit version of Edge, you may notice that, unlike the original repro, it will not crash Edge (even though it does trigger the issues): the heap spray has allocated the memory that the out-of-bounds read accesses, and this prevents an access violation exception. Refreshing the page is likely to screw up the precise allocation process needed and will probably cause a crash.

This proves that it is theoretically possible to allocate information at the address used by the code. All that is left is prove that the information read by the code can be exfiltrated somehow, and you have a working exploit. This is left as an exercises to the reader.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2016-3247 Microsoft Edge CTextExtractor::GetBlockText OOB read details

---

*From*: Berend-Jan Wever <berendj () nwever nl>

*Date*: Fri, 18 Nov 2016 11:32:16 +0100

```
Throughout November, I plan to release details on vulnerabilities I
found in web-browsers which I've not released before. This is the
fourteenth entry in that series. Unfortunately I won't be able to
publish everything within one month at the current rate, so I may
continue to publish these through December and January.

The below information is available in more detail on my blog at
<http://blog.skylined.nl/20161118002.html>.

Follow me on <http://twitter.com/berendjanwever> for daily browser bugs.

Microsoft Edge CTextExtractor::GetBlockText OOB read
=====================================
(MS16-104, CVE-2016-3247)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted web-page can cause an integer underflow in Microsoft
Edge. This causes `CTextExtractor::GetBlockText` to read data outside of
the bounds of a memory block.

Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations
-------------------------------------------------------
* Microsoft Edge 11.0.10240.16384
  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted web-page. JavaScript is not necessarily required to trigger
  the issue.

Description
-----------
Though I did not investigate thoroughly, I did find out the following:
* The root cause appears to be an integer underflow in a 32-bit
  variable used in `CTextExtractor..GetBlockText` as an index to read a
  `WCHAR` in a string buffer. This index is decreased once too often
  and becomes -1, or a very large positive number depending on how it
  is used.
* This does not result in a crash on 32-bit systems, as an integer wrap
  causes the code to read one `WCHAR` before the start of the buffer,
  which is normally also in allocated memory.
* On 64-bit systems, the 32-bit -1 value is interpreted as 0xFFFFFFFF,
  a very large positive value. As this is an index into a `WCHAR`
  string, it gets multiplied by two and added to the start of the
  buffer to find the location of a `WCHAR` to read. This causes the OOB
  read to be around 8Gb (!!) beyond the address at which the buffer is
  allocated.
* The crash happens in code that appears to be rendering the web-page,
  which does not immediately offer an obvious way of extracting
  information using this bug.

Exploit
-------
This is where it gets interesting, as the OOB read happens
approximately 0x2`00000000 bytes after the address at which the buffer
is allocated. This presents us with a problem: how to store some
information that we'd be interested in reading at such a large offset
from the original allocation?

As one might come to expect from me, I used a heap spray. But it needed
to be a special kind of heap spray as I did not want to actually have to
allocate 8Gb of RAM. However, about ten years ago (boy, time flies!) I
developed a heap spray that uses significantly less RAM than a
traditional heap spray does; in practice probably about 33% in most
cases, but theoretically much more in ideal situations. I've been
meaning to blog about it, but never found the time to do so until today:
you can read all about it here:

<http://blog.skylined.nl/20161118001.html>

That said, I have not actually looked at whether it is possible to
exfiltrate useful information using this bug. However, I did write a
Proof-of-Concept that attempts to make sure something is allocated in
the area where the OOB read happens. This PoC uses these heap spray
tricks to spray the heap while minimizing memory use. The
Proof-of-Concept uses about ~5.3Gb to allocate the memory at around 8Gb
distance from the buffer (up to ~10Gb to be sure). When you load the PoC
in a 64-bit version of Edge, you may notice that, unlike the original
repro, it will not crash Edge (even though it does trigger the
issues): the heap spray has allocated the memory that the out-of-bounds
read accesses, and this prevents an access violation exception.
Refreshing the page is likely to screw up the precise allocation process
needed and will probably cause a crash.

This proves that it is theoretically possible to allocate information at
the address used by the code. All that is left is prove that the
information read by the code can be exfiltrated somehow, and you have a
working exploit. This is left as an exercises to the reader.

Time-line
---------
* June 2016: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
* June 2016: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI and iDefense.
* July 2016: This vulnerability was acquired by ZDI.
* September 2016: This vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in
  MS16-104.
* November 2016: Details of this issue are released.

Cheers,

SkyLined

# Microsoft Edge CText­Extractor::Get­Block­Text OOB read

([MS16-104](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS16-104), [CVE-2016-3247](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3247))

## Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause an integer underflow in Microsoft Edge.
This causes `CText­Extractor::Get­Block­Text` to read data outside of the bounds
of a memory block.

## Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations

* **Microsoft Edge 11.0.10240.16384**

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  web-page. Java­Script is not necessarily required to trigger the issue.

## Description

Though I did not investigate thoroughly, I did find out the following:

* The root cause appears to be an integer underflow in a 32-bit variable used
  in `CText­Extractor..Get­Block­Text` as an index to read a `WCHAR` in a string
  buffer. This index is decreased once too often and becomes -1, or a very
  large positive number depending on how it is used.
* This does not result in a crash on 32-bit systems, as an integer wrap causes
  the code to read one `WCHAR` before the start of the buffer, which is
  normally also in allocated memory.
* On 64-bit systems, the 32-bit -1 value is interpreted as `0x­FFFFFFFF`, a very
  large positive value. As this is an index into a `WCHAR` string, it gets
  multiplied by two and added to the start of the buffer to find the location
  of a `WCHAR` to read. This causes the OOB read to be around 8Gb (!!) beyond
  the address at which the buffer is allocated.
* The crash happens in code that appears to be rendering the web-page, which
  does not immediately offer an obvious way of extracting information using this
  bug.

## Exploit

This is where it gets interesting, as the OOB read happens approximately
`0x2`00000000` bytes after the address at which the buffer is allocated. This
presents us with a problem: how to store some information that we'd be
interested in reading at such a large offset from the original allocation?

As one might come to expect from me, I used a heap spray. But it needed to be a
special kind of heap spray as I did not want to actually have to allocate 8Gb
of RAM. However, about ten years ago (boy, time flies!) I developed a heap
spray that uses significantly less RAM than a traditional heap spray does;
in practice probably about 33% in most cases, but theoretically much more in
ideal situations. I've been meaning to blog about it, but never found the time
to do so until today: [you can read all about it here](20161118001.html).

That said, I have not actually looked at whether it is possible to exfiltrate
useful information using this bug. However, I did write a Proof-of-Concept
that attempts to make sure something is allocated in the area where the OOB
read happens. This Po­C uses these heap spray tricks to spray the heap while
minimizing memory use. The Proof-of-Concept uses about ~5.3Gb to allocate
the memory at around 8Gb distance from the buffer (up to ~10Gb to be sure).
When you load the Po­C in a 64-bit version of Edge, you may notice that, unlike
the original repro, it will not crash Edge (even though it does trigger the
issues): the heap spray has allocated the memory that the out-of-bounds read
accesses, and this prevents an access violation exception. Refreshing the page
is likely to screw up the precise allocation process needed and will probably
cause a crash.

This proves that it is theoretically possible to allocate information at the
address used by the code. All that is left is prove that the information read
by the code can be exfiltrated somehow, and you have a working exploit. This
is left as an exercises to the reader.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Edge Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Microsoft Edge and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the Chakra JavaScript engine renders when handling objects in memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Microsoft Edge and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

## Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability CVE-2016-3291

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Edge handles cross-origin requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could determine the origin of all of the web pages in the affected browser.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Edge handles cross-origin resources.

## Multiple Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities exist in the way that the affected components handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could obtain information to further compromise a target system.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the affected components handle objects in memory.
