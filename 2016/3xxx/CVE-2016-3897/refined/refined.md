Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3897:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure flaw related to how Wi-Fi configurations are handled. Specifically, the issue is located in `WifiEnterpriseConfiguraiton` class where the function `toString()` can potentially print credentials (usernames/passwords) within the string output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The `toString()` method of `WifiEnterpriseConfiguration` could expose sensitive credentials. The commit message explicitly states: "WifiEnterpriseConfiguration: Do not print credentials in toString." This indicates the credentials were not being properly masked or excluded when the object was converted to a string representation.
- **Use of `==` for String comparison:** The commit message "Fix string equality comparison. Don't use "==" to compare strings." indicates the use of "==" for comparing strings in the code, which can lead to unexpected behavior, although not directly tied to the information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Credentials:** A malicious application could potentially obtain Wi-Fi credentials (usernames and passwords) by accessing the string output of `WifiEnterpriseConfiguration` objects.
- **Unauthorized Network Access:** If an attacker gains access to these credentials, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to the associated Wi-Fi network.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious application:** A local malicious application that has the necessary permissions (such as permission to access Wi-Fi configuration) could access this information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the device.
- **Appropriate permissions:** The malicious application needs the permission to access Wi-Fi configurations.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability in `WifiEnterpriseConfiguration`'s `toString()` method.
