  "CVE-2016-3116": {
    "description": "CRLF injection vulnerability in Dropbear SSH before 2016.72 allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended shell-command restrictions via crafted X11 forwarding data.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation of X11 forwarding data, specifically the x11authprot and x11authcookie parameters. These parameters are passed to the xauth command via stdin, and since newlines act as command separators, a malicious user can inject arbitrary xauth commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-93",
      "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated user to bypass shell command restrictions. They can execute arbitrary commands as the user running the dropbear process, gaining unauthorized access and control over the system. This includes the ability to read/write arbitrary files, leak information, and connect to other devices. Specifically, users with forced-command restrictions or /bin/false shells are able to circumvent those limitations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Specifically through crafted X11 forwarding data during an SSH session"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target system with X11 forwarding enabled on the server side. The vulnerability is exploited by including newline characters within X11 forwarding data sent by the client, which are then interpreted by xauth as command separators."
