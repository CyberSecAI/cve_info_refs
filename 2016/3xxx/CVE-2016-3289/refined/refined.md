Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer improperly access objects in memory. Specifically, it involves memory corruption vulnerabilities when handling objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption that occurs due to improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. This memory corruption allows for the possibility of arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- **Full System Control (with Admin Rights):** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with administrative rights.
- **Information Disclosure (in some scenarios):** Although not the primary impact of CVE-2016-3289, the documents mention that related vulnerabilities in the same security bulletin could allow for information disclosure, potentially aiding further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Webpages:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage designed to exploit the memory corruption vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites/Content:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content or ads.
- **Email/Instant Messages:** Attackers may attempt to trick users into visiting malicious webpages via phishing or other social engineering tactics within emails or IMs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host a Webpage:** The attacker needs a way to host or inject malicious content into a webpage, or to send an email with a link to the malicious page.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince a user to view the specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. This generally involves some kind of social engineering or trickery.
