- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how FileNet Workplace handles uploaded files, allowing malicious content (specifically JavaScript) to be uploaded and potentially executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload malicious files containing JavaScript code that, when viewed by users within the Application Engine (AE), could be executed, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker uploads a file with malicious JavaScript code to the FileNet Workplace. When this file is accessed through AE, the JavaScript is executed in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the FileNet Workplace application and have a user within AE view the file.
