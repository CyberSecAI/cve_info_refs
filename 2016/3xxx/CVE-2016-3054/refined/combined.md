# Security Bulletin: FileNet Workplace can be affected by the File Upload XSS vulnerability (CVE-2016-3054)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

FileNet Workplace is susceptible to the File Upload XSS vulnerability

## Vulnerability Details

**Relevant CVE Information:**

## Affected Products and Versions

FileNet Workplace 4.0.2

## Remediation/Fixes

Refer to the Workarounds and Mitigations section.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

There are 2 different implementations that can be used to address this vulnerability. You may chose to implement only one or to use both.

1) Check and remove malicious content before it gets added in to the P8 repository.

2) Check when malicious content is being viewed and not allow it to be executed.

The following are some suggestions on the various ways to prevent malicious files from being either uploaded and/or executed. These methods have not been implemented or tested by IBM. They are just examples. For detailed implementation plans, please consult IBM ECM Lab Services or an IBM ECM Business Partner.

To avoid malicious content being entered in to the P8 repository:

(1) Create a custom event action that's triggered on an AddDocument event that checks either the file type being added or calls a file scanner to validate the contents before the content is added.

(2) Configure a file scanner to scan the storage volume where content is being saved and have it send an alert when it finds malicious content.

To prevent content that contains JavaScript code from being executed when it is viewed by AE:

(1) Force JavaScript files to be viewed as text. An AE response filter could be implemented to change the MIME Type from JavaScript to Text.

(2) Configure your browser to not execute JavaScript files.
