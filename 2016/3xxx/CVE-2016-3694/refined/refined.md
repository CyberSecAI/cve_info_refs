Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-3694

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection. It arises from the lack of proper sanitization of the GET parameters `orders_status` and `customers_status` in the `easybillcsv.php` file of the modified eCommerce shop software. These parameters are directly incorporated into a SQL query without being escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Specifically, the `orders_status` and `customers_status` GET parameters are processed with `preg_replace` to remove whitespace and `explode` to create an array, then `implode` it back into a string with `', '` separators, but the individual values are not escaped or sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including customer information, order details, and potentially administrative credentials.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify database records, leading to data integrity issues or potentially taking over the application.
- **Denial of Service:** By injecting malicious SQL queries, an attacker could cause database performance degradation or even server crashes.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The injection could potentially be used to execute arbitrary SQL functions, possibly leading to further compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `easybillcsv.php` file.
- **Manipulated Parameters:** Attackers modify the `orders_status` and/or `customers_status` parameters to inject SQL code.
- **Bypassing Token check:** By providing the `token` parameter set to `MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN`, an attacker can bypass the direct access restriction and trigger the vulnerable code path.
   - Note: This is a known constant, so bypassing is trivial when the module is not installed (which is default)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft malicious queries for injection.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the existence of the vulnerable endpoint, `easybillcsv.php`, and the vulnerable parameters.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit example demonstrates the use of `sleep(5)` to cause a time delay, which is a typical technique for confirming a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.
- The exploit also demonstrates how to bypass the whitespace filter by using functions like `substring` and `ascii`.
- The vulnerability exists in version `2.0.0.0 rev 9678` of the modified eCommerce shop software.
- The vulnerability lies in the SQL query on line 67, 68, and 71 in `/admin-folder/includes/modules/system/easybillcsv.php`.
- The exploit suggests that the injection cannot include whitespace or commas directly but it details methods to bypass this.
