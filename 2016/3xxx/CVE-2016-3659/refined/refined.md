Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3659:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `graph_view.php` file of Cacti.
- Specifically, the `host_group_data` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query within the `grow_right_pane_tree` function located in `/lib/html_tree.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`host_group_data` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
-  The code uses `db_fetch_cell('select name from graph_templates where id=' . $host_group_data_array[1]);` to retrieve data. The `$host_group_data_array[1]` comes directly from the user input `$_REQUEST['host_group_data']`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, which can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive information)
    - Data modification or deletion
    - Potential compromise of the server via database-level exploits
- The provided POC shows how an attacker could use `UNION SELECT` and `SLEEP` commands to verify and exploit the SQL injection.
- Specifically the attacker can use a crafted `host_group_data` parameter such as `graph_template:1 union select case when ord(substring((select version()) from 1 for 1)) between 53 and 53 then sleep(5) else 0 end`

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `graph_view.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameter is part of the `$_REQUEST`, meaning both GET and POST requests are viable attack vectors

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication required:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in Cacti user.
- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to access the Cacti web interface.

**Additional notes:**
- The `validate_tree_vars()` and `sanitize_search_string()` functions, while intended to filter out malicious input, are bypassed using specific MySQL techniques.
- The provided proof of concept uses a time-based SQL injection technique to verify the exploit.
- The vulnerable code is present in Cacti versions up to and including 0.8.8.g.
- Patches for this vulnerability were included in Cacti version 0.8.8h.
