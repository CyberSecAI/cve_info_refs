Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within Drupal's Form API, where access restrictions defined by setting `#access` to `FALSE` on form button elements are ignored when submitting the form via methods other than the standard form submission (e.g., through JavaScript). This allows a user to trigger actions associated with buttons they shouldn't have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Control Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of access controls intended to restrict the use of specific form buttons. The `#access` property is not enforced during non-standard form submissions, like JavaScript, meaning that buttons which should be hidden or disabled for specific users can still be triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially gain privileges they are not supposed to have by triggering actions tied to restricted buttons. For example, if an administrator has access to a button that deletes a content and a normal user does not, the normal user could use this vulnerability to delete content as if they were an administrator by sending a crafted form submit.
*   **Unintended Actions:** The ability to submit forms with disabled buttons could lead to unintended actions, potentially modifying, deleting or adding information they should not have rights to manage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JavaScript:** Attackers can use JavaScript to submit form data including values for buttons where they do not have explicit access.
*   **Crafted Form Submissions:** Attackers can manually craft HTTP requests to submit forms with button values that are normally inaccessible to them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Form Access:** The attacker must have access to a form that contains buttons where the `#access` property is set to `FALSE` for the attacker's role.
*   **Ability to Submit the Form:** The attacker must be able to submit the form using methods other than a standard browser form submission, which can be done through JavaScript or through manually crafted requests.
*   **Awareness of Protected Actions:** The attacker needs to be aware of the actions associated with form buttons that have the `#access` property set to `FALSE` to understand the impact of their actions.

**Mitigation:**

The CVE description mentions this vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have access to submit a form that has such buttons defined for it, highlighting that there needs to be a form with buttons that have access restrictions in place. However, the vulnerability itself is a bypass of these controls. The provided text doesn't explicitly give a complete fix, but it can be assumed this would be addressed in the patches provided for this issue by enforcing access control before form submission.
