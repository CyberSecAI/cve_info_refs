Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Windows Secure Boot improperly applies certain policies. Specifically, it fails to correctly validate the policies which results in a security bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Secure Boot Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass Secure Boot security features. Secure Boot is designed to ensure that only trusted code is loaded during the boot process.
*   **Code Integrity Checks Disabled:** Exploiting the vulnerability allows attackers to disable code integrity checks which results in the loading of test-signed executables and drivers. This enables execution of untrusted or malicious code.
*   **BitLocker and Device Encryption Bypass:** The vulnerability also allows attackers to bypass Secure Boot Integrity Validation for BitLocker and Device Encryption, which compromises full-disk encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malware Persistence:** Attackers can install and load malicious code which persists even after rebooting.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** With the bypass of encryption and code integrity checks, sensitive data is exposed to attackers.
*   **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Policy Installation:** The primary attack vector involves installing a specifically crafted, malicious policy on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges or Physical Access:** The attacker must have either administrative privileges on the target system or physical access to the device to install the malicious policy.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided documents link the vulnerability to security bulletin MS16-094 and specifically to update KB3177404.
*   The fix involves blacklisting the affected policies.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" across all affected Windows versions.
*   The content provides workarounds for users which include disabling secure boot and using BitLocker with TPM+PIN authentication.
