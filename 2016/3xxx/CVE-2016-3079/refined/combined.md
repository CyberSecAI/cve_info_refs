[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0590)

## Topic

An update for spacewalk-java is now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a
detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Satellite is a system management tool for Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and the remote management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.

Security Fix(es):

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in how XML data was handled in Red Hat Satellite. A user able to use the XMLRPC API could exploit this flaw to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users. (CVE-2015-0284)
* Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way certain form data was handled in Red Hat Satellite. A user able to enter form data could use these flaws to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users. (CVE-2016-2103, CVE-2016-3079)
* Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way HTTP GET parameter data was handled in Red Hat Satellite. A user able to provide malicious links to a Satellite user could use these flaws to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users. (CVE-2016-2104)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Willard (Raytheon Foreground Security) for reporting CVE-2016-2104. The CVE-2015-0284 and CVE-2016-3079 issues were discovered by Jan Hutař (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c0)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-23 09:19:23 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There are two XSS issues due to element creation in SSM (Perl stack) and displaying outside of it   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): spacewalk-java-2.3.8-129.el6sat.noarch spacewalk-html-2.3.2-34.el6sat.noarch   How reproducible: always   Steps to Reproduce: 1/a. Systems -> select ~2 with Provisioning add-on entitlement      -> [Manage] in upper right corner of the page  /b. SSM -> Provisioninng -> Tag Systems -> enter '"><script>alert()</script>'      -> Tag Current Snapshots  /c. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshot Tags 2/a. Systems -> Systems Set Manager  /b. SSM -> in "Groups: Create and manage groups" click "Create"  /c. Fill name: '"><script>alert(1)</script>' and random description  /d. Systems -> <random_system> -> Groups -> Join  /e. join that group  /f. you are redirected to Groups -> List/Leave   Actual results: In 1/c, 2/d and 2/f JavaScript alerts get executed   Expected results: No alerts   Additional info: I'm OK with merging this bug into different XSS related if that makes sense.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c1)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-28 18:58:45 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github:  7920542f   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c4)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 09:50:23 UTC  ``` I'm sorry, this was not part of initial reproducer, but realized and tested just now:  1/a. Systems -> select ~2 with Provisioning add-on entitlement      -> [Manage] in upper right corner of the page  /b. SSM -> Provisioninng -> Tag Systems -> enter '"><script>alert()</script>'      -> Tag Current Snapshots  /c. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshot Tags  new part:   /d. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshots      -> <snapshot_with_tag> -> Snapshot Tags  This page allows XSS as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c5)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 09:52:58 UTC  ``` Also this one:   /e. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshot Tags      -> select <xss_tag> using checkbox -> [Remove Tags]  Page "Confirm Snapshot Tag Removal" triggers it.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c6)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 09:59:48 UTC  ``` And while on that confirm-*-removal-note, one new step for the second issue here:  2/a. Systems -> Systems Set Manager  /b. SSM -> in "Groups: Create and manage groups" click "Create"  /c. Fill name: '"><script>alert(1)</script>' and random description  /d. Systems -> <random_system> -> Groups -> Join  /e. join that group  /f. you are redirected to Groups -> List/Leave  new part is:   /g. Systems -> System Groups -> <xss_group> -> Delete Group  This "System Group Deletion Confirmation" shows XSS and:   /h. ... -> Confirm  this page saying 'System group "">" deleted.' as well.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c7)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 10:07:40 UTC  ``` Grr. Note that you can create system group with malicious name using API as well:    print client.systemgroup.create(key, '[bz1181152](show_bug.cgi?id=1181152 "CLOSED ERRATA - XSS when altering user details and going somewhere where you are choosing user")create"><script>alert("created name")</script>', 'a"><script>alert("created desc")</script>')  and to extend issue 2 even more:   /i. Users -> <user> -> System Groups  /j. Admin -> Users -> <user> -> System Groups   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c8)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-30 17:25:57 UTC  ``` spacewalk-.github: b6491eba   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-04-04 15:37:25 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c0)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-23 09:19:23 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There are two XSS issues due to element creation in SSM (Perl stack) and displaying outside of it   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): spacewalk-java-2.3.8-129.el6sat.noarch spacewalk-html-2.3.2-34.el6sat.noarch   How reproducible: always   Steps to Reproduce: 1/a. Systems -> select ~2 with Provisioning add-on entitlement      -> [Manage] in upper right corner of the page  /b. SSM -> Provisioninng -> Tag Systems -> enter '"><script>alert()</script>'      -> Tag Current Snapshots  /c. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshot Tags 2/a. Systems -> Systems Set Manager  /b. SSM -> in "Groups: Create and manage groups" click "Create"  /c. Fill name: '"><script>alert(1)</script>' and random description  /d. Systems -> <random_system> -> Groups -> Join  /e. join that group  /f. you are redirected to Groups -> List/Leave   Actual results: In 1/c, 2/d and 2/f JavaScript alerts get executed   Expected results: No alerts   Additional info: I'm OK with merging this bug into different XSS related if that makes sense.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c1)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-28 18:58:45 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github:  7920542f   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c4)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 09:50:23 UTC  ``` I'm sorry, this was not part of initial reproducer, but realized and tested just now:  1/a. Systems -> select ~2 with Provisioning add-on entitlement      -> [Manage] in upper right corner of the page  /b. SSM -> Provisioninng -> Tag Systems -> enter '"><script>alert()</script>'      -> Tag Current Snapshots  /c. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshot Tags  new part:   /d. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshots      -> <snapshot_with_tag> -> Snapshot Tags  This page allows XSS as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c5)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 09:52:58 UTC  ``` Also this one:   /e. SSM -> Systems -> <one_of_the_systems> -> Provisioning -> Snapshot Tags      -> select <xss_tag> using checkbox -> [Remove Tags]  Page "Confirm Snapshot Tag Removal" triggers it.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c6)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 09:59:48 UTC  ``` And while on that confirm-*-removal-note, one new step for the second issue here:  2/a. Systems -> Systems Set Manager  /b. SSM -> in "Groups: Create and manage groups" click "Create"  /c. Fill name: '"><script>alert(1)</script>' and random description  /d. Systems -> <random_system> -> Groups -> Join  /e. join that group  /f. you are redirected to Groups -> List/Leave  new part is:   /g. Systems -> System Groups -> <xss_group> -> Delete Group  This "System Group Deletion Confirmation" shows XSS and:   /h. ... -> Confirm  this page saying 'System group "">" deleted.' as well.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c7)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-30 10:07:40 UTC  ``` Grr. Note that you can create system group with malicious name using API as well:    print client.systemgroup.create(key, '[bz1181152](show_bug.cgi?id=1181152 "CLOSED ERRATA - XSS when altering user details and going somewhere where you are choosing user")create"><script>alert("created name")</script>', 'a"><script>alert("created desc")</script>')  and to extend issue 2 even more:   /i. Users -> <user> -> System Groups  /j. Admin -> Users -> <user> -> System Groups   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c8)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-30 17:25:57 UTC  ``` spacewalk-.github: b6491eba   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-04-04 15:37:25 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
