Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3991:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the `loadImage()` function within the `tiffcrop` tool.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient buffer size allocation.
- The `loadImage()` function reads the number of tiles from a TIFF file. If the number of tiles is zero, the function proceeds to read tile data by calling `readContigTilesIntoBuffer()` from the image, even though it does not allocate enough buffer.
- Specifically, only 3 bytes of memory are allocated to store the tile data while processing zero tiles, even if a tile data beyond 3 bytes is read from file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by enticing a user to process a specially crafted TIFF image.
- This could lead to a denial of service (crash) due to a heap overflow.
- There's a possibility of arbitrary code execution if a crafted tile data causes memory corruption to write attacker controlled values.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through processing a specially crafted TIFF image using the `tiffcrop` tool with zero tiles.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to create a malicious TIFF image.
- They would also require a target user to open/process the malicious TIFF file using the vulnerable `tiffcrop` tool.
- The attacker does not require authentication.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in LibTIFF versions 4.0.6 and earlier.
- The provided content also references a patch made available by CentOS. The patch was applied by Openwall project, as well, to the upstream code.
- Different vendors acknowledged and resolved the vulnerability in different timelines using specific security updates/advisories (SUSE, RedHat, Debian).

- Some documents mention that CVE-2016-3991 is related to or a duplicate of CVE-2016-5322, CVE-2016-3990, CVE-2016-3623, and CVE-2016-3945, CVE-2016-5320.

- CVE-2016-3991 is related to an out-of-bounds write issue in the `loadImage()` function of `tiffcrop` tool

Based on all the information, the root cause for CVE-2016-3991 is an insufficient buffer size allocation during processing zero-tile TIFF images in the tiffcrop tool which could be triggered by a crafted TIFF file. This leads to an out-of-bounds write when tile data is read.
