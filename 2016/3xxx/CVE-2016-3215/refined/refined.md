  "CVE-2016-3215": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows PDF Library. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of JPEG2000 files. A crafted number of decomposition levels in a COD marker can trigger a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.",
