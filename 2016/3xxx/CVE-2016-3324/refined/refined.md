  "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3324",
  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
  "information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the `MSHTML!PROPERTYDESC::HandleStyleComponentProperty` function. This code handles CSS properties and assumes that a property value is always a string set to either \"true\" or \"false\". To determine which of these two values it is, the code checks if the fifth character is '\\0'. However, it's possible to set such values to arbitrary strings, including a smaller string, causing the code to read beyond the end of the string.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds read."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially leading to full control of the system if the user has administrative privileges. It can also lead to information disclosure by reading beyond the intended memory bounds.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage in Internet Explorer."
  },
    "Additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `text-decoration-blink`, `text-decoration-line-through`, `text-decoration-line-none`, `text-decoration-overline` or `text-decoration-underline` CSS properties. The exploit uses heap feng shui techniques to control memory layout, making the out-of-bounds read more reliable and enabling info disclosure. The code reads a WCHAR (2 bytes) at an offset that may be outside of the allocated memory, allowing to determine if the value is null or not. On x64, this causes an AV with page heap enabled. The vulnerability was found by fuzzing."
