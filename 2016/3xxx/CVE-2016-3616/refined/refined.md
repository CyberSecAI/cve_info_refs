{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference occurs in the `get_text_gray_row` function in `rdppm.c` of the libjpeg library when processing a malformed PPM file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (application crash). In some cases, this may also allow remote code execution if the library is used in a system that accepts user input.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted PPM file to the `cjpeg` utility.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PPM file to an application that utilizes the vulnerable `cjpeg` utility from the libjpeg library."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "libjpeg-turbo",
     "cjpeg utility"
  ],
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located within the `cjpeg` utility which is a client program for libjpeg, not the library itself. The `cjpeg` utility when used with a malformed PPM file, causes a null pointer dereference leading to a crash.  This issue was fixed with the same patch that fixed CVE-2018-11213 and CVE-2018-11214"
