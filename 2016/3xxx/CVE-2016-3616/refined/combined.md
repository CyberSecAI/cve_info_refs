RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Sidhpurwala    2016-03-25 04:38:03 UTC  ``` Aladdin,  After analyzing this issue, it seems that the flaw is in the cjpeg utility shipped with libjpeg and not in the library itself. The cjpeg utility is used to compress an image file and produce a JPEG image.  Interestingly when i run this file through netpbm (pgmtopbm), it correctly handles it and the following message is printed:  pamditherbw: ASCII decimal integer in file is too large to be processed.   P4 23 1 pamtopnm: End of file encountered when trying to read a row from input file.   which shows that it is doing the right thing.  The above being said, i want to make this bug public, since it does not sound very serious, you ok with that?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1318509#c5)  Aladdin Mubaied    2016-03-25 04:46:14 UTC  ``` Sure if the issue is only in the cjpeg utility, you can make this bug public. ty   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1318509#c6)  Huzaifa S.

# USN-3706-2: libjpeg-turbo vulnerabilities

10 July 2018

libjpeg-turbo could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libjpeg-turbo](/security/cves?package=libjpeg-turbo) - library for handling JPEG files

## Details

USN-3706-1 fixed a vulnerability in libjpeg-turbo. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that libjpeg-turbo incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted JPEG image, a remote attacker could cause libjpeg-turbo

to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

Package        : libjpeg-turbo
Version        : 1:1.3.1-12+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-3616 CVE-2018-1152 CVE-2018-11212 CVE-2018-11213
                 CVE-2018-11214
Debian Bug     : #819969 #902950 #902176

Several vulnerabilities have been resolved in libjpeg-turbo, Debian's
default JPEG implemenation.

CVE-2016-3616

    The cjpeg utility in libjpeg allowed remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or
    execute arbitrary code via a crafted file.

    This issue got fixed by the same patch that fixed CVE-2018-11213 and
    CVE-2018-11214.

CVE-2018-1152

    libjpeg-turbo has been found vulnerable to a denial of service
    vulnerability caused by a divide by zero when processing a crafted
    BMP image. The issue has been resolved by a boundary check.

CVE-2018-11212

    The alloc_sarray function in jmemmgr.c allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error) via a crafted file.

    The issue has been addressed by checking the image size when reading
    a targa file and throwing an error when image width or height is 0.

CVE-2018-11213
CVE-2018-11214

    The get_text_gray_row and get_text_rgb_row functions in rdppm.c both
    allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (Segmentation
    fault) via a crafted file.

    By checking the range of integer values in PPM text files and adding
    checks to ensure values are within the specified range, both issues

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.3.1-12+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libjpeg-turbo packages.

# USN-3706-1: libjpeg-turbo vulnerabilities

9 July 2018

libjpeg-turbo could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [libjpeg-turbo](/security/cves?package=libjpeg-turbo) - library for handling JPEG files

## Details

It was discovered that libjpeg-turbo incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted JPEG image, a remote attacker could cause libjpeg-turbo

to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

## Topic

An update for libjpeg-turbo is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The libjpeg-turbo packages contain a library of functions for manipulating JPEG images. They also contain simple client programs for accessing the libjpeg functions. These packages provide the same functionality and API as libjpeg but with better performance.

Security Fix(es):

* libjpeg: null pointer dereference in cjpeg (CVE-2016-3616)
* libjpeg-turbo: heap-based buffer over-read via crafted 8-bit BMP in get\_8bit\_row in rdbmp.c leads to denial of service (CVE-2018-14498)
* libjpeg-turbo: Divide By Zero in alloc\_sarray function in jmemmgr.c (CVE-2018-11212)
* libjpeg: Segmentation fault in get\_text\_gray\_row function in rdppm.c (CVE-2018-11213)
* libjpeg: Segmentation fault in get\_text\_rgb\_row function in rdppm.c (CVE-2018-11214)
* libjpeg: "cjpeg" utility large loop because read\_pixel in rdtarga.c mishandles EOF (CVE-2018-11813)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
