Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An illegal read occurs within the `cpStrips` and `cpTiles` functions in `thumbnail.c` of libtiff.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing check when accessing the `bytecounts` array. Specifically, when `bytecounts[s]` is larger than `bufsize`, a reallocation of the buffer occurs, and if this reallocation fails the function returns. However there isn't a check on the value of `bytecounts[s]` before this operation. This means `bytecounts[s]` could point to memory outside the bounds of valid memory. This causes a crash during a read to `bytecounts`.
- The vulnerability is an illegal read that occurs when the code attempts to compare `bytecounts[s]` with `bufsize` if the value of `s` is too large to be read from `bytecounts`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS). The illegal read leads to a segmentation fault, causing the `thumbnail` tool to crash.
- The Gentoo advisory suggests that arbitrary code execution might be possible, but the provided details don't confirm this for this specific vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image file using the `thumbnail` tool.
- An attacker would need to provide a malicious TIFF file as input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted TIFF image to a user or system running the vulnerable `thumbnail` tool of `libtiff`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippet and GDB output clearly show the location of the illegal read.
- The Gentoo security advisory also lists this CVE with a range of other vulnerabilities.
- The `bytecounts` array is out of bounds in the crash scenario, which is the core of this vulnerability.
