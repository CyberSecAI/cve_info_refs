Subject: Re: CVE request - XStream: XXE vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Use CVE-2016-3674 for the XStream vulnerability that was resolved by
this change.

These seem to be present in one or more Linux distributions and thus
might have widespread deployment, e.g.,

  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/xom.git>
  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/bea-stax.git>

Within the context of XStream itself, we do not feel that the
XomDriver or BEAStaxDriver behavior should have a CVE stating that
version 1.4.9 is vulnerable, because
<http://x-stream.github.io/faq.html#Security_XXEVulnerability>
explicitly documents the behavior, and XStream users could reasonably
be expected to look at that FAQ document before choosing XomDriver or
BEAStaxDriver for use with untrusted XML documents.

However, that FAQ document might suggest that the underlying problems
are upstream implementation errors, e.g., the design of these pieces
of code would be reasonably expected to support ignoring all external
entities but did not achieve that:

  <https://java.net/projects/xom/sources/svn/content/trunk/src/nu/xom/tests/BuilderTest.java>
  private static class NonEntityResolvingFilter extends XMLFilterImpl

  <https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/stax/stax-src/1.2.0/stax-src-1.2.0.distribution-zip>
  src/com/bea/xml/stream/ConfigurationContextBase.java

Does anyone want to request two CVE IDs for these two products? (We
think that the StAX issue is more general than CVE-2013-7315.)

RHSA-2016:2822 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2016-11-28
Updated:
2016-11-28
# RHSA-2016:2822 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.0 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.3.4, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes of the patch linked to in the References section.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that several XML parsers used by XStream had default settings that would expand entity references. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2016-3674)
* Drools Workbench contains the path traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated attacker to bypass the directory restrictions and retrieve arbitrary files from the affected host. (CVE-2016-7041)
* JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are vulnerable to a stored XSS via business process editor. The flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-5398. Remote, authenticated attackers that have privileges to create business processes can store scripts in them, which are not properly sanitized before showing to other users, including admins. (CVE-2016-8608)

Red Hat would like to thank Jonas Bauters (NVISO) for reporting CVE-2016-7041. The CVE-2016-8608 issue was discovered by Kirill Gaevskii (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

## Affected Products

* Red Hat JBoss Middleware Text-Only Advisories for MIDDLEWARE 1 x86\_64

## Description

[![@guykoth](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1426077?v=4&size=48)](/guykoth)[guykoth](https://github.com/guykoth)opened [on Sep 7, 2015](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/25#issue-105175980)

DTD processing was enabled and therefore, XML deserialization process was vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (I was able to expose local files).

[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML\_External\_Entity\_(XXE)\_Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing)

Suggestion is to ignore client-side DOCTYPE declarations.

Message-ID: <nd3k26$2sr$1@ger.gmane.org>

Subject: CVE request - XStream: XXE vulnerability

Hi all,

XStream (x-stream.github.io) is a Java library to marshal Java objects into
XML and back. For this purpose it supports a lot of different XML parsers.
Some of those can also process external entities which was enabled by
default.

An attacker could therefore provide manipulated XML as input to access data
on the file system, see
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing)

Since XStream 1.4.9 all parsers are configured to ignore external entities
by default as far as such behavior is configurable:
<http://x-stream.github.io/changes.html#1.4.9>

Luckily XStream's default parser Xpp3 does not parse entities at all.
However, all application that use XStream >= 1.4.8 explicitly with parsers
based on StAX, W3C DOM, Dom4J, JDOM or JDOM2 were affected unless the
parsers had been properly configured manually.

Applications using XOM or explicitly BEA's old StAX reference parser are
still vulnerable, we found no way to deactivate processing of external
entities for those two.

Regards,
Jörg

On behalf of the XStream community

RHSA-2016:2823 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2016-11-28
# RHSA-2016:2823 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss BRMS security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss BRMS.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4.0 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.3.4, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes of the patch linked to in the References section.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that several XML parsers used by XStream had default settings that would expand entity references. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2016-3674)
* Drools Workbench contains the path traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated attacker to bypass the directory restrictions and retrieve arbitrary files from the affected host. (CVE-2016-7041)
* JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are vulnerable to a stored XSS via business process editor. The flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-5398. Remote, authenticated attackers that have privileges to create business processes can store scripts in them, which are not properly sanitized before showing to other users, including admins. (CVE-2016-8608)

Red Hat would like to thank Jonas Bauters (NVISO) for reporting CVE-2016-7041. The CVE-2016-8608 issue was discovered by Kirill Gaevskii (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

  previous versions of XStream, can still be deserialized.
* The Optional types with new converters of package java.util, that have been written with previous versions
  of XStream, can still be deserialized.
* The WildcardTypePermission allows by default no longer anonymous class types.

Released January 29, 2022.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2021-43859](CVE-2021-43859.html), when unmarshalling highly recursive collections or maps causing a
Denial of Service.

## API changes

# 1.4.18

Released August 22, 2021.

This maintenance release addresses following security vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with
an XStream instance using the default blacklist of an uninitialized security framework. XStream is therefore now
using a whitelist by default.

## Minor changes

* [#233](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/233): Support serializable types with non-serializable parent with PureJavaReflectionConverter.

## Stream compatibility

Starting with version 1.14.12 nine years ago, XStream contains a
[Security Framework](security.html#framework) to implement a black- or whitelist for the allowed types
at deserialization time. Until version 1.4.17, XStream kept a default blacklist in order to deny all types of the
Java runtime, which are used for all kinds of [security attacks](security.html#CVEs), in order to
guarantee optimal runtime compatibility for existing users. However, this approach has failed. The last months
have shown, that the Java runtime alone contains dozens of types that can be used for an attack, not even looking
at the 3rd party libraries on a classpath. The new version of XStream uses therefore now by default a whitelist,
which is recommended since nine years. It also has been complaining on the console for a long time about an
uninitialized security framework the first time it was run. Anyone who has followed the advice and initialized the
security framework for their own scenario can easily update to the new version without any problem. Everyone else
will have to do a proper initialization now, otherwise the new version will fail with certainty at deserialization
time.

# 1.4.17

Released May 13, 2021.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2021-29505](CVE-2021-29505.html), when unmarshalling with XStream instance using an uninitialized
security framework.

## Stream compatibility

* The following types are now blacklisted by default and the deserialization
  of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable these types by explicit
  configuration, if you need them:
  + any type in the java.rmi.\* and sun.rmi.\* package hierarchies
  + the individual type com.sun.jndi.toolkit.dir.LazySearchEnumerationImpl

# 1.4.16

Released March 13, 2021.

This maintenance release switches XStream's default parser and addresses following security
vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with an XStream instance using an uninitialized security framework.

* [CVE-2021-21341](CVE-2021-21341.html)
* [CVE-2021-21342](CVE-2021-21342.html)
* [CVE-2021-21343](CVE-2021-21343.html)
* [CVE-2021-21344](CVE-2021-21344.html)
* [CVE-2021-21345](CVE-2021-21345.html)
* [CVE-2021-21346](CVE-2021-21346.html)
* [CVE-2021-21347](CVE-2021-21347.html)
* [CVE-2021-21348](CVE-2021-21348.html)
* [CVE-2021-21349](CVE-2021-21349.html)
* [CVE-2021-21350](CVE-2021-21350.html)
* [CVE-2021-21351](CVE-2021-21351.html)

## Major changes

* Switch from Xpp3 as default parser to MXParser, a fork of Xpp3.

## Minor changes

* [#238](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/238): Fix possibility to process references on enum types at deserialization.
* [#237](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/237): Fix optimization in XmlFriendlyNameCoder.

## Stream compatibility

* The following types are now blacklisted by default and the deserialization
  of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable these types by explicit
  configuration, if you need them:
  + the type hierarchies for java.io.InputStream, java.nio.channels.Channel,
    javax.activation.DataSource and javax.sql.rowsel.BaseRowSet
  + the individual types com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry,
    com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator,
    sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator, and sun.swing.SwingLazyValue
  + the individual types com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry,
    com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator,
    sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator, and sun.swing.SwingLazyValue
  + the internal type Accessor$GetterSetterReflection of JAXB, the internal types
    MethodGetter$PrivilegedGetter and ServiceFinder$ServiceNameIterator of JAX-WS
  + all inner classes of javafx.collections.ObservableList
  + an internal ClassLoader used in a private copy of BCEL within the Java runtime

## Dependencies

The default parser of XStream has changed from the Xpp3Parser in artifact xpp3:xpp3\_min to MXParser, a fork of
Xpp3 in the artifact io.github.x-stream:mxparser. The Xpp3 is unmaintained for a long time, bugs have been fixed
reported more than a decade ago, improvements by other forks have been incorporated and some endless loops have
been fixed, that could have been utilized as DoS attack.

XStream has therefore new default dependencies. If you have used XStream with the default driver (i.e. Xpp3),
you can still exchange the XStream library for a drop-in replacement, but you will also have to remove the Xpp3 and
add the MXParser library instead.

For build time you will have to add the Xpp3 library to your dependencies, if you made explicitly use of the
Xpp3 driver. If you did explicitly use a different driver than Xpp3 and had therefore excluded the Xpp3
dependency, you might have to exclude now the new MXParser dependency instead to minimize your dependency list.

# 1.4.15

Released December 13, 2020.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerabilities
[CVE-2020-26258](CVE-2020-26258.html) and [CVE-2020-26259](CVE-2020-26259.html), when
unmarshalling with XStream instance using an uninitialized security framework.

## Minor changes

* [#226](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/226): XmlFriendlyNameCoder does not accept '9' as valid character in an XML name.
* [#228](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/228): DefaultMapper should handle IllegalArgumentException thrown by Class.forName().

## Stream compatibility

* The type jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString and the internal JAX-WS type ReadAllStream.FileStream
  are now part of the default blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the two types will fail.
  You will have to enable these types by explicit configuration, if you need them.

## Delivery

Any XStream release can run with a minimal Java runtime environment of Java 1.4 as long as this environment will
process only requested classes of the jar file. Until version 1.4.14 XStream was delivered also as special Java 7
version for Android, because Dalvik scans all classes and fails at classes requiring a higher runtime version. However, this
special version will not work in a normal Java 8 environment or higher and was never meant do so.

Unfortunately, this version has to be build always after the standard version due to the build sequence. The
latest version in Maven Central however is always the one that has been deployed last independently from the time
of publishing. This creates an annoyance now in GitHub for any project using the Dependabot service which creates
automated pull requests with updates to the latest XStream version, because it injects now the special Java 7
version that probably breaks these projects.

Users who still require a special version for Java 7 will have to build this artifact now on their own. Users
for even older Java environments had always to do so anyway.

# 1.4.14

Released November 16, 2020.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2020-26217](CVE-2020-26217.html), reported originally as CVE-2017-9805 for Struts' XStream Plugin,
an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling with XStream instances using an uninitialized security
framework.

## Stream compatibility

* The types java.lang.ProcessBuilder and javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter are now part of the default
  blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable
  these types by explicit configuration, if you need them.

# 1.4.13

Released September 6, 2020.

## Major changes

* [#218](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/218): Defer reflective access to Java core modules.
* [#207](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/207): New predefined blacklist avoids vulnerability due to improper setup of the security framework.

# 1.4.12

Released April 12, 2020.

## Minor changes

* XmlFriendlyNameCoder supports now XML parsers implementing only 4th edition of XML 1.0 specification.
* Fix support of CDATA events in StAX.
* [#171](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/171): XStream.createObjectInputStream does not pass the DataHolder.
* [#151](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/151): Use of SPDX license identifier in POM and Manifest.
* [#152](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/152): Declare OSGi import of internal runtime packages as optional.
* Drop Require-Capability entry in manifest.

# 1.4.11.1

Released October 27, 2018.

## Hot fix

* [#133](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/133): XStream 1.4.11 fails to run on a Java Runtime < 8.

# 1.4.11

Released October 23, 2018.

This maintenance release addresses again the security vulnerability [CVE-2013-7285](CVE-2013-7285.html), an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling with XStream instances using an
uninitialized security framework. Only 1.4.10 uninitialized security framework was affected.

## Minor changes

* [#91](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/91), [#106](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/106): Clean-up data stacks in UnmarshallingContext implementations in case of exception (by
  Märt Bakhoff).
* [#2](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/2): Unneeded contention in DefaultConverterLookup.
* [#94](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/94): Fix PathConverter containing absolute Windows paths.
* [#105](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/105): XStream's ObjectInputStream returns wrong values for readUnsignedByte and readUnsignedShort.
* [XSTR-616](/jira/616) and [#93](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/93): Introduce StringCodec interface to support arbitrary Base64 codec
  implementations for EncodedByteArrayConverter. Prefer Base64 codec implementations of the Java runtime over
  XStream's own one.
* [#97](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/97): Support to run out of the box in a Java 1.4 runtime is established again.
* Provide methods in AbstractCollectionConverter that read and write in a balanced way from and to the
  hierarchical stream.
* New future-proof method JVM.isVersion to detect major version of Java runtime (incl. Java 10) as
  replacement for individual JVM.isXY methods.
* [#115](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/115): Dom4JDriver ignores character set of Dom4J configuration creating a Writer.
* [#116](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/116): Make converters null safe.
* [#123](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/123) and [#124](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/124): Declare XPP dependencies for OSGi as optional.
* Add XppDriver.createDefaultParser for a simpler access to the default XmlPullParserFactory.
* Old BEA reference implementation of StAX is outdated, unmaintained and has security issues, therefore
  XStream's driver has been deprecated.
* Support for JaCoCo: FieldDictionary ignores synthetic fields starting with *$jacoco* as name.
* Add integration test for OSGi (by Wes Wannemacher).

## Stream compatibility

* The EncodedByteArrayConverter will now use an encoder by default that does no longer add line breaks as
  normally required by the RFC 1521 after 76 characters, making it also easier to use the converter for
  attributes. This will not affect XStream's Base64 decoder.

## API changes

# 1.4.10

Released May 23, 2017.

This maintenance release addresses also the security vulnerability [CVE-2017-7957](CVE-2017-7957.html), used for a Denial of Service attack by crashing the Java runtime.

## Major changes

* [#84](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/84): New XStream artifact with *-java7* appended as version suffix for a library explicitly
  without the Java 8 stuff (lambda expression support, converters for java.time.\* package).
* Fix PrimitiveTypePermission to reject type *void* to prevent CVE-2017-7957 with an initialized
  security framework.
* Improve performance by minimizing call stack of mapper chain.
* [#82](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/82), [XSTR-774](/jira/774): Add converters for types of java.time, java.time.chrono, and java.time.temporal
  packages (converters for LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime, OffsetDateTime, and ZonedDateTime by Matej Cimbora).
* [#29](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/29): JavaBeanConverter does not respect ignored unknown elements.
* Add XStream.setupDefaultSecurity to initialize security framework with defaults of XStream 1.5.x.
* Emit error warning if security framework has not been initialized and the XStream instance is vulnerable to
  known exploits.

## Stream Compatibility

* The alias *duration* for type *javax.xml.datatype.Duration* has changed to *xml-duration*
  due to the support of the classes in the java.time package. *duration* is now used for type *java.time.Duration*.
  Simply register the alias *duration* again for type *javax.xml.datatype.Duration* if backward
  compatibility is required for this type.
* All types of the java.time packages that have been written with previous versions of XStream can still be
  deserialized.

## Minor changes

* [#52](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/52): PathConverter fails for file paths with spaces.
* PathConverter uses always forward slashes as path separator.
* [#53](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/53): SqlTimestampConverter cannot parse values without fraction.
* [#45](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/45): Support different time zones for SqlTimestampConverter.
* [#67](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/67) and [#68](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/68): Allow usage of DataHolder for createObjectInputStream and createObjectOutputStream.
* [#75](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/75): Use java.time.\* package instead of Joda-Time.
* Dom4JXmlWriter does not flush writer at endDocument().
* Path is an immutable type.
* [#65](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/65): Protect converter lookup against runtime errors.

# 1.4.7

Released February 8, 2014.

This maintenance release addresses mainly the security vulnerability [CVE-2013-7285](CVE-2013-7285.html), an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling.

## Major changes

* Add [security framework](security.html#framework) to limit handled types while unmarshalling.
* java.bean.EventHandler no longer handled automatically because of severe security vulnerability.
* [XSTR-751](/jira/751): New SunLimitedUnsafeReflectionProvider that uses undocumented features only to allocate new
  instances as required on Dalvik.

  instance.

## Minor changes

* XSTR-749: NPE if ReflectionConverter.canConvert(type) is called with null as argument.
* XSTR-753: NPE if SerializationConverter.canConvert(type) is called with an interface type as argument that

# 1.4.6

Released December 12, 2013.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-566](/jira/566) and [XSTR-200](/jira/200): Better compatibility with GAE and environments with active SecurityManager
  (i.e. in an Applet). XStream converters try now to ensure already in the canConvert methods that they can handle the
  requested type in practice and not only theoretically. Additionally the implementations even better take care, that
  the initialization of a converter will not break the setup of XStream itself. Following modifications have been done
  for these topics:
  + ReflectionConverter, SerializationConverter and LookAndFieldConverter will check if they can access the
    fields by reflection for a requested type.
  + SerializationConverter and ExternalizableConverter will check if they can create an instance of a derived
    OutputObjectStream first.
  + BeanProvider does no longer use reflection to locate default constructor.
  + AbstractAttributedCharacterIteratorAttributeConverter (and therefore TextAttributeConverter) will check
    first if it can access the possible constants of the type by reflection.
  + NoClassDefFoundError raised in GAE accessing the fields of restricted types by reflection will be handled.
  + StackTraceElementConverter uses constructor for StackTraceElement instances in Java 5 and GEA.
* [XSTR-739](/jira/739) and [XSTR-746](/jira/746): OrderRetainingMap fails if HashMap.putAll(Map) of Java Runtime is not
  implemented calling put for every element within the map.
* New NamedArrayConverter to define names of inner elements.

## Minor changes

* [XSTR-747](/jira/747): All constructors of StaxDriver derived classes take erroneously a XmlFriendlyNameCoder instead
  of a plain NameCoder.

## API changes

* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.NamedArrayConverter for free element names in arrays.
* Added constructors to c.t.x.io.xml.StandardStaxDriver taking NameCoder instead of XmlFriendlyNameCoder.

  stream reading from file or URL.
* [XSTR-736](/jira/736): XStream.unmarshal may throw NPE if version info of manifest is missing.

  with the nearest matching element type.
* [XSTR-740](/jira/740): ISO8601GregorianCalendarConverter creates Calendar instance with wrong Locale in Java 7 if the
  Locale for the LocaleCategory.FORMAT is different to the global default Locale.
* [XSTR-578](/jira/578): Implement support for aliasing in JavaClasConverter, JavaFieldConverter and

* NPE in XppDomComparator.
* Dom4JXmlWriter fails to flush the underlying writer.
* Known control characters are not encoded with JsonWriter as proposed at json.org.
* Detect duplicate property processing in JavaBeanConverter and throw DuplicatePropertyException instead of
  clobbering silently.
* Allow access to Mapper and JavaBeanProvider in derived instances of JavaBeanConverter.
* DependencyInjectionFactory failed to create instance when a matching constructor was found, but a default
  constructor was also present.

## API changes

* Added interface c.t.x.io.ExtendedHierarchicalStreamReader extending c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamReader. All
  implementations of c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamReader will implement also the extended interface.
* Added c.t.x.converters.reflection.MissingFieldException derived from
  c.t.x.converters.reflection.ObjectAccessException and used instead when the unmarshalling process should write a
  field or property that is missing and does not exist.
* Added methods c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.peekElement(), c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.peekElement(int), and
  c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.depth().
* Deprecated method c.t.x.core.ReferencingMarshallingContext.currentPath(). Wrong approach.

# 1.4.1

Released August 11, 2011.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-659](/jira/659): Use again Xpp3 as default parser, now with additional XmlPullParser API as regular dependency
  for the XPP factory. Only standard kXML2 package contains the XPP factory, but not the minimal kXML2 version.

## Minor changes

* Add utility class c.t.x.io.xml.xppdom.XppFactory and a path tracking comparator for XppDom.

# 1.4

Released August 6, 2011.

## Major changes

* Java 7 is detected and supported.
* [XSTR-542](/jira/542): The XppDriver uses now the official XmlPullParser API to locate an available parser using the
  XmlPullParserFactory. This allows the usage of XPP technology with XStream in Android.
* Additional explicit XPP drivers for the Xpp3 and kXML2 implementations.
* Additional explicit XPP DOM drivers for the Xpp3 and kXML2 implementations.
* kXML2 is now the preferred parser implementation, Xpp3 is optional.

* [XSTR-553](/jira/553): Support annotations in Android.
* [XSTR-556](/jira/556): DateConverter uses format with 3-letter time zones that are ambiguous. Therefore it will now

* The type java.lang.reflect.Field is now handled by an own converter, that can still read the old format.
* [XSTR-490](/jira/490): Provide path in Converter for contexts that track the path.
* [XSTR-592](/jira/592)+[XSTR-579](/jira/579): OmitField respected at deserialization time even for existing fields.

  c.t.x.converters.reflection.ExternalizableConverter and c.t.x.converters.reflection.CGLIBEnhancedConverter; new
  versions take an additional argument for class loader (as a result for [XSTR-547](/jira/547)).
* Deprecated constructors of c.t.x.io.xml.XppReader, new versions take an additional argument for the
  XmlPullParser.

  may provide additional error information now.

# 1.3.1

Released December 6, 2008.

CGLIB support must be explicitly activated now. The decision has been made due to possible
problems using an own classloader and because of ongoing complaints about occurring exceptions in the
CGLIBEnhancedConverter at XStream initialization although they are caused by incompatible ASM versions on the user's
classpath ([XSTR-469](/jira/469), [XSTR-513](/jira/513) and [XSTR-518](/jira/518)).

XStream uses some attributes on its own. Until now it was possible to use
XStream.aliasAttribute to define a different name. This does still work but is deprecated for system attributes. Use
the new call XStream.aliasSystemAttribute for such an alias.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-515](/jira/515): CGLIB support is no longer activated automatically and has to be [explicitly turned on](faq.html#Serialization_CGLIB).

  Radzin).

## Minor changes

  with Jettison 1.0.
* [XSTR-493](/jira/493): Using attributes for fields with XML-unfriendly names results in NPE at deserialization.
* [XSTR-497](/jira/497): Unsafe operation with WeakHashMap can raise a NPE in Sun14ReflectionProvider.
* [XSTR-423](/jira/423): Support of CGLIB enhanced proxies with multiple callbacks if the proxy uses a factory (CGLIB
  default).

* [XSTR-495](/jira/495): StreamStrategy cannot handle key with value *null*.

## API changes

* Deprecated c.t.x.io.json.JsonHierarchicalStreamWriter in favour of c.t.x.io.json.JsonWriter.
* c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper no longer derives from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper as it has been before version
  1.3. Therefore the new constructor has been deprecated in favour of the old one.
* c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String) has been deprecated in favour of
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String, Class) taking the type as third argument that should be
  handled by the converter.
* c.t.x.core.ReferenceByIdMarshaller.IdGenerator.next() has now the current object as argument.
* New c.t.x.persistence.PersistenceStrategy and c.t.x.persistence.FilePersistenceStrategy.
* Deprecated c.t.x.persistence.StreamStrategy and c.t.x.persistence.FileStreamStrategy.

## Major changes

* ReflectionConverter writes now the fields of the parent classes first.

* Refactoring of Annotation support, invent auto-detection mode.
* Annotated converters are no longer detected automatically, all annotations are now handled in the same way.
* [XSTR-334](/jira/334): XStream will deserialize directly from a file or URL. Some parser take advantage of these
  objects to define a SystemId used to resolve further references in XML, schema or DTD. Appropriate createReader
  methods have been added to c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamDriver.
* [XSTR-261](/jira/261): All c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamDriver implementations respect now the encoding of an XML
  header if read from an InputStream.

* Added converter for java.util.UUID instances.
* [XSTR-430](/jira/430): Fields written as attributes could not be omitted.
* [XSTR-407](/jira/407): Comparator might access uninitialized elements for TreeSet and TreeMap. A deserialized
  Comparator is no longer called, the converters expect the elements now in a sorted order.
* [XSTR-404](/jira/404), @XStreamImplicit() for ArrayList<ArrayList<Type>> throws ClassCastException.
* @XStreamContainedType() for ArrayList<ArrayList<Type>> throws ClassCastException.
* XStreamer did not persist a FieldKeySorter instance.
* [XSTR-241](/jira/241): JavaBeanConverter now supports customized BeanProvider.

* XStream.createObjectInputStream and XStream.createObjectOutputStream overloaded to support a binary
  InputStream or OutputStream.
* [XSTR-470](/jira/470): Allow transient fields to be optionally deserialized.

## API changes

* c.t.x.annotation.Annotations, c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationReflectionConverter and
  c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationProvider deprecated. Functionality is integrated in new c.t.x.mapper.AnnotationMapper and
  accessible with new methods c.t.x.XStream.processAnnotations().
* New auto-detection mode for annotations, that can be turned on with c.t.x.XStream.autodetectAnnotations()
* c.t.x.annotation.@XStreamContainedType deprecated, the behaviour is now always active and the annotation
  therefore superfluous.
* Due to [XSTR-421](/jira/421) null characters are no longer written as tag with an attribute (<char
  null="true"/>), but as empty tag. The old representation is still supported at deserialization.
* Characters that are not defined in unicode or ISO control characters (expect TAB and LF) are written as
  numerical entity now.
* XPath references are now also XML-friendly encoded to match the path exactly. Unencoded references will
  normally work anyway, but in special cases the exact behaviour of XStream 1.2.x might be necessary. See acceptance
  tests for XStream 1.2.x compatibility.
* c.t.x.core.BaseException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.XStreamException as base exception for all exceptions
  XStream throws.
* c.t.x.XStream.InitializerException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.InitializerException.
* New methods get() and keys() in interface c.t.x.converter.ErrorWriter.
* c.t.x.mapper.XmlFriendlyMapper deprecated, technology is replaced since version 1.2 by
  c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyReplacer as part of the different XmlWriter implementations.
* c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.aliasForAttribute() and c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.attributeForAlias() deprecated, since it
  provided in reality the combined functionality of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.serializedMember()/realMember() and
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType().
* c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, Mapper, HierarchicalStreamDriver) deprecated, in favour of
  c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, HierarchicalStreamDriver, Mapper, ClassLoader).
* New interface c.t.x.converter.ConverterRegistry to express explicit functionality managing the converters.
* c.t.x.core.DefaultConverterLookup no longer uses a c.t.x.mapper.Mapper. Therefore the old constructor has
  been deprecated in favour of a default constructor.
* Overloaded methods of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType and
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute have been deprecated. Only one version has been kept, the
  implementation can handle all cases now at once and therefore multiple calls to the mapper chain are avoided.
* c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper derives now from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper to support enums as attributes.
  Therefore the old constructor has been deprecated in favour of one taking an additional
  c.t.x.converters.ConverterLookup that has to be passed to the new parent.

Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that
each converter can handle a null value in its marshalling methods. If you have implemented your own custom converters,
try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities in case XStream will provide such values with its next
major version.

# Version 1.2.2

Released May 24, 2007.

Note, that next version of XStream will behave slightly different by default. XStream emits
all fields in declaration order like Java serialization. But in contrast to Java it will omit the fields of parent
classes last while Java serialization emits them first. This makes it difficult to match a given XML schema that
defined inherited types or leads sometimes to obscure initialization problems. However, XStream itself will not be
affected by the changed order of elements in the XML, any deserialization of current XML representations will work
fine. Anyway we will provide with XStream 1.3 a FieldKeySorter implementation that mimics the old behaviour. In the
meanwhile you can enforce the new field sorting by installing the NaturalFieldKeySorter.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-391](/jira/391), Support for writing (and reading) JSON by the new JettisonMappedXmlDriver (by Dejan Bosanac).
* New FieldKeySorter interface allows a custom sort order of the XML elements.
* [XSTR-68](/jira/68) and [XSTR-210](/jira/210), OmitField is now respected at deserialization to ignore removed fields.

## Minor changes

* [XSTR-387](/jira/387), Fix aliasing of inherited fields.
* [XSTR-395](/jira/395), Fix StringConverter allocating PermGen space.
* [XSTR-368](/jira/368), @XStreamConverter converters should be cached inside the AnnotationReflectionConverter.
* [XSTR-392](/jira/392), @XStreamOmitField can be used to omit fields from the resulting XML (contributed by Chung-Onn
  Cheong).
* [XSTR-371](/jira/371), Fix JSONWriter that omits a closing bracket for for fields with null value.
* [XSTR-398](/jira/398), DomDriver ignores given XmlFriendlyReplacer.
* [XSTR-370](/jira/370), Buildable with JDK 6, fix FontConverter for JDK 6.
* [XSTR-382](/jira/382), Support hex and octal number values.
* DateConverter did not respect change in TimeZone after first usage.
* [XSTR-375](/jira/375), Support for aliasing native types.

  by Andrea Aime).
* Ability to alias fields as well as classes, using XStream.addFieldAlias().
* [XSTR-70](/jira/70), [XSTR-204](/jira/204) Support for JDK 5 enums (contributed by Eric Snell and Bryan Coleman).
* [XSTR-206](/jira/206) Clean representation of JDK 5 EnumMap and EnumSet.

* Bugfix: [XSTR-180](/jira/180) Serializable objects support defaultReadObject() even when no default fields available.
* Bugfix: For serialized objects class hierarchy is serialized starting with superclass (as per Java Object
  Serialization).
* Bugfix: readObject() is now called for classes containing only transient fields.
* Bugfix: Order of fields are maintained when calling ObjectOutputStream.putFields().
* Bugfix: FontConverter extended to support FontUIResource which does some awkward native calls.
* Bugfix: Deserialization of very complicated graphs (such as Swing components) sometimes resulted in broken
  object references. Now fixed.
* Bugfix: [XSTR-188](/jira/188) Classes that use readResolve()/writeReplace() can now return different types.

# Version 1.1

Released January 15, 2005. Focus on support for objects defining custom serialization using the standard [Java serialization](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html) mechanism.

## Major changes

* Provides drop in replacement for ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, using
  XStream.createObjectInputStream() and XStream.createObjectOutputStream() and XStream.createObjectInputStream(). This
  provides support for streaming objects.
* Support for objects that specify their own serialization schemes by implementing readObject() and
  writeObject() (as in Java serialization spec). This includes support for ObjectInputStream.getFields() and
  ObjectOuputStream.putFields().
* Support for objects to serialize other objects to the stream by implementing writeReplace() (as in Java
  serialization spec).
* Support for any object that performs custom serialization by implementing java.io.Externalizable (as in Java
  serialization spec).
* Implicit collections can be specified for classes, allowing the element wrapping the collection to be
  skipped.
* New writer implementations to allow XStream to serialize directly to a SAX stream or TrAX pipeline.
* The MarshallingContext and UnmarshallingContext interfaces now extend DataHolder, allowing arbitrary data to
  be stored by the user whilst walking the object graph and passed around to Converters. DataHolders can also be passed
  into XStream from the outside.
* Includes new DomWriter implementation to serialize directly to a W3C DOM tree (to complement the existing
  DomReader).
* Better support for instantiating objects on non Sun 1.4+ JVMs, including non-public constructors, private
  static inner classes and ANY class that implements java.io.Serializable.
* DOM, DOM4J, JDOM, XOM, Electric-XML, SAX, STAX
* Specific ClassLoaders can be passed into XStream, to allow for greater compatibility in J2EE containers.
* Ability to change the default converter
* Added optional ISO8601DateConverter for full ISO8601 date format support. The converter is not registered by
  default as it requires the joda-time dependency (http://joda-time.sf.net). To use, ensure joda-time is in classpath
  and register explicitly.
* Enhanced mode is now supported on the Apple 1.4 JDK.

## Minor changes

* PrettyPrintWriter only flushes stream when necessary - large performance improvement for serialization.
* Added XStream.fromXml(xml, root) convenience methods for deserializing into an existing root object.
* JDK 1.3 compatibility: Added mechanism for accessing nested exception.
* JDK 1.3 compatibility: GregorianCalendarConverter only calls Calendar.getTimeInMillis() the JDK supports it.
* Bugfix: All caches are now synchronized - there were some thread safety issues.
* Bugfix: Only *immutable* basic types will have references ignored in XML (for clarity).
* Bugfix: Class names can contain underscores.
* Bugfix: Support for '\0' char.
* Bugfix: PropertyConverter no longer attempts to serialize subclasses of Properties.
* Bugfix: JVM detection uses system properties, which is more accurate than searching the classpath.

## API changes

* XStream.addDefaultCollection() has been deprecated. Use XStream.addImplicitCollection() instead.

# Version 1.0.2

Released August 7, 2004. Focus on improving the converters bundled with XStream to support a wider range of
types.

## Major changes

* XML elements are written in order they are defined in class, rather than alphabetical.
* Converters for java.io.File, java.sql.Timestamp, java.awt.Color, and dynamic proxies are now registered by
  default.
* EncodedByteArrayConverter is now registered by default and uses a single Base64 string to store the contents
  of a byte[]. This now works on all JVMs as it no longer relies on Sun specific classes. This converter will also
  unmarshal byte[] that have been serialized without it, for backwards compatability.
* New converters for java.sql.Time, java.sql.Date, java.util.Locale, java.util.Currency, java.util.Calendar and
  java.awt.Font.
* All caching is done in XStream instance instead of statics, allowing applications that use hot redeployment
  of classes to use XStream in a parent classloader.
* XStream will fail fast if a field value is defined more than once in XML when deserializing.

## Minor changes

* The <entry> element used in Maps can now be specified by creating an alias for java.util.Map.Entry.
* Bugfix: Fields with characters that generate invalid XML (such as $ signs) are now escaped.
* Bugfix: Pre-instantiated objects can be unmarshalled through multiple levels.

## API changes

* None.

# Version 1.0.1

Released May 30, 2004. Misc features and bugfixes.

## Major changes

* Support for multidimensional arrays.
* Object with readResolve() method will be treated the same way native serialization treats them.

## Minor changes

* New converters for Throwable and StackTraceElement that retain stack trace (JDK 1.4 only)
* Bugfix: System.identityHashCode() is not guaranteed to be unique. Ensure reference checking is used as well.
* Bugfix: Allows user classes to be defined in WEB-INF/classes in Servlet environments. Tries to use context
  classloader if available.
* Support for java.util.Currency (through readResolve()).
* Instances of Jakarta Commons Lang Enum are now reused (through readResolve()).
* Bugfix: JavaClassConverter handles primitive type classes (contributed by Matthew Sandoz).

## API changes

* Additional method: ConverterLookup.defaultConverter(). Custom implementations of this class should implement
  this new method.

# Version 1.0

Released May 14, 2004. Focusses on finalizing the API for 1.0 release.

## Major changes

* Supports fields of same name, hidden by inheritance.

## Minor changes

* JavaDoc for most important parts of API.

## API changes

* The ReflectionConverter and ReflectionProviders have had an overhaul to support hidden fields. Most methods
  now take an extra argument to specify which class a field is declared in.

# Version 1.0 (release candidate 1)

Released May 9, 2004. Focusses on finalizing the API for 1.0 release.

## Major changes

* JDK 1.3 compatibility.
* Informative error messages.
* Defaults to using faster XPP based parser.
* Serializes final field under JDK 1.4.
* Fail fast when trying to serialize final field if not Sun 1.4 JRE.

## Minor changes

* Misc performance improvements.
* Converters for TreeMap and TreeSet that store the Comparator.

## API changes

* Default constructor for XStream class uses XppDriver instead of DomDriver. To use DomDriver, explicitly pass
  it in to the constructor.
* Exception is thrown if trying to serialize an object that contains a final field if not Sun 1.4 JRE.

For this purpose it supports a lot of different XML parsers.  Some of those can also process external entities which was enabled by  default.  An attacker could therefore provide manipulated XML as input to access data  on the file system, see  [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1321789#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-29 07:30:22 UTC  ```  Created jenkins-xstream tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1321792](show_bug.cgi?id=1321792 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-3674 jenkins-xstream: XStream: enabled processing of external entities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1321789#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-29 07:30:47 UTC  ```  Created xstream tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1321791](show_bug.cgi?id=1321791 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-3674 XStream: enabled processing of external entities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1321789#c6)  Pavel Polischouk    2016-03-31 20:41:56 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/25>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1321789#c8)  Fedora Update System    2016-04-04 17:24:15 UTC  ``` xstream-1.4.9-1.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
