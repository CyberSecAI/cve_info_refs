Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `UserAjax.getUsersList` method within the dotCMS application. This method is accessed via a DWR (Direct Web Remoting) endpoint. Specifically, the `c0-e3` parameter, which is meant to be a query string, is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation on the `c0-e3` parameter, which allows an attacker to inject SQL commands.
- **DWR Endpoint Exposure:** The DWR endpoint `/dwr/call/plaincall/UserAjax.getUsersList.dwr` is accessible and vulnerable to the SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Access:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access sensitive information from the dotCMS database. This could include usernames, passwords, personal data, and other confidential data stored within the application's database.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Depending on the database configuration and permissions, the attacker might be able to potentially modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable DWR endpoint.
- **Malicious SQL in `c0-e3`:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `c0-e3` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to have an authenticated user session with dotCMS.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the dotCMS server to send the malicious request.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Version:** dotCMS version 3.3 is vulnerable.
- **Fix Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in dotCMS versions 3.3.2 and 3.5.
- **Mitigation:** The vendor recommends preventing external access to the `/dwr` endpoint via firewall rules as a mitigation strategy.
- **Proof of Concept:** The provided content includes a proof-of-concept POST request demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using a SQL injection payload (`%25'%20and%201%3D1%20and%20'%25'%3D'`).
