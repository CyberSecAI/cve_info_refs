Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3105:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the `convert` extension in Mercurial handles repository paths when converting from Git repositories. Specifically, the path passed to `git-ls-remote` could be misinterpreted as a URL by Git, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The core vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution. This is due to the way Mercurial's `convert` extension interacts with Git, specifically when dealing with specially crafted Git repository names. When converting a Git repository to Mercurial format, the repository's path was not properly sanitized, and Git could be tricked into executing code through a crafted repository name that resembled a URL.
*   **Path Misinterpretation:** Git could misinterpret the path to the repository as a URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Mercurial process, potentially leading to full system compromise if the user has sufficient privileges.
*   **Compromise of Automated Services:** Automated code conversion services that allow arbitrary repository names are especially vulnerable, meaning that attackers could use this flaw to gain access to a wider range of systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Git Repository Names:** The attack vector involves using a Git repository with a specially crafted name that is designed to exploit Git's interpretation of URLs. This malicious name is passed to git-ls-remote command
*   **Mercurial convert Extension:** The `convert` extension in Mercurial is the point of entry to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Git Repository:** The attacker needs the ability to provide or influence the name/path of a Git repository that will be used in a Mercurial conversion process.
*   **Usage of Mercurial's Convert Extension:** The attacker must be able to trigger the use of the `convert` extension of Mercurial on the crafted Git repository.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication. However, it is rated as "Single" authentication by SUSE, while NVD has rated it as "None" which could mean it requires some local or automated access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that an absolute path is always passed to Git, preventing it from misinterpreting the path as a URL.
*   The vulnerability is a side-effect of Git's CVE-2015-7545
*   The provided test case uses "ext::sh -c echo% pwned% >GIT-EXT-COMMAND-INJECTION% #" as a malicious name.
