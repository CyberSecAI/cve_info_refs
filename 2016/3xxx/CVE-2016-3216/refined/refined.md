        "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of DIB (Device Independent Bitmap) data within EMF (Enhanced Metafile) record handlers in gdi32.dll.",
        "weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in the failure of multiple EMF record handlers to properly validate the offsets and lengths of DIB headers and data. Specifically, the following conditions are not properly checked:\n\n1) `cbBmiSrc` (size of the DIB header) is within expected bounds.\n2) The `(offBmiSrc, offBmiSrc + cbBmiSrc)` region resides within the record buffer's area.\n3) `cbBitsSrc` (size of DIB data) is within expected bounds, and is larger or equal to the expected number of bitmap bytes.\n4) The `(offBitsSrc, offBitsSrc + cbBitsSrc)` region resides within the record buffer's area.\n\nMissing checks allow out-of-bounds reads while parsing/loading the bitmap, and in some cases memory disclosure.",
        "impact": "Heap-based out-of-bounds reads, leading to potential memory disclosure. This can allow attackers to steal sensitive information from program memory, or defeat ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) to reliably exploit other vulnerabilities.",
        "attack_vectors": "Crafting a malicious EMF file with specially crafted DIB-embedding records that cause the vulnerable handlers to attempt to create DIB objects using out-of-bounds memory regions.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted EMF file to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through various means, such as tricking a user into opening the file, or embedding it in a web page or document.",
