Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to embed arbitrary JavaScript code within reports via Hyperlink or Hyperlink Button (HTML Item) objects in IBM Cognos Analytics. These objects allow report authors to insert HTML, including potentially malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS issue. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize or validate the HTML input, leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript code when a report is viewed/executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Potential Credentials Disclosure:** By executing arbitrary javascript an attacker could steal credentials within a trusted session.
*   **Altered Functionality:** The injected JavaScript can modify the intended behavior of the Web UI.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Report Creation:** Attackers need to be able to create or modify reports, specifically using the Hyperlink or HTML item.
*   **Report Execution:** The malicious code is activated when a user executes/views a report containing the injected HTML item.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to execute/open the malicious report in order for the exploit to work

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Report Authoring Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a report author, or be able to modify a report created by another user.
*   **Low Privileged User:** The attacker does not need a high privilege level to perform this exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a victim to open or execute the crafted report.
