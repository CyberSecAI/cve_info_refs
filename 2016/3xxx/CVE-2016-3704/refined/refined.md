{
  "CVE-2016-3704": {
    "description": "Pulp makes unsafe use of Bash's $RANDOM to generate a NSS DB password and seed resulting in insufficient randomness. An attacker could potentially guess the seed used given enough time and compute resources.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of bash's `$RANDOM` variable, which provides pseudo-random numbers with a limited range and predictability. This was used to generate both the NSS database password and the seed for cryptographic operations in the `pulp-qpid-ssl-cfg` script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient randomness",
        "Predictable password generation",
        "Use of insecure pseudo-random number generation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with sufficient time and computational resources could potentially guess the seed, and possibly the NSS database password. This would give an attacker access to sensitive data encrypted with the NSS database.",
       "attack_vectors": "An attacker who can observe or infer the sequence of numbers generated by $RANDOM can attempt to derive the seed used to create the database. This can be done by gaining knowledge of the $RANDOM sequence or by brute forcing possible seeds.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to observe or deduce the values generated by `$RANDOM` and have the computational ability to attempt to derive the seed or password."

     "affected_components": [
      "Pulp's `pulp-qpid-ssl-cfg` script"
     ],
      "patches": [
         "The vulnerability was patched by replacing `$RANDOM` with `/dev/urandom` as a source of random data. This was implemented to generate both the NSS DB password and the seed for cryptographic operations"
