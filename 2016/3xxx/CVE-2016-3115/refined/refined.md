      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within the X11 forwarding mechanism of OpenSSH. Specifically, the `auth_data` parameter, which contains the X11 authentication cookie, is not sanitized before being passed to the xauth command. A newline character in the cookie acts as a command separator to the xauth binary, allowing arbitrary xauth commands injection.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')",
         "Insufficient Input Validation",
        "Command Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "An authenticated user can bypass intended restrictions, such as forced commands and restricted shells, and gain limited file read/write access, information leakage (environment variables/path) , and X11-connect capabilities by injecting arbitrary xauth commands. An attacker with valid credentials and permission to establish X11 forwarding sessions can bypass other restrictions that may be set on their account like the ForceCommand directives.",
      "Attack Vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted x11 channel request by an authenticated user. Specifically, the attacker sends a malicious X11 auth cookie containing newline characters, which are interpreted as command separators by the vulnerable xauth binary.",
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker requires valid user credentials to connect to the server via SSH and needs the server to have `X11Forwarding yes` enabled. It allows an authenticated user to inject commands to xauth(1) on the server. The attacker also needs permission to establish X11 forwarding sessions."
