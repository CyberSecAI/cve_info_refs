## Topic

An update for docker is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that Docker would launch containers under the specified UID instead of a username. An attacker able to launch a container could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root within the launched container. (CVE-2016-3697)

This issue was discovered by Mrunal Patel (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* The process of pulling an image spawns a new "goroutine" for each layer in the image manifest. If any of these downloads, everything stops and an error is returned, even though other goroutines would still be running and writing output through a progress reader which is attached to an http response writer. Since the request handler had already returned from the first error, the http server panics when one of these download goroutines makes a write to the response writer buffer. This bug has been fixed, and docker no longer panics when pulling an image. (BZ#1264562)
* Previously, in certain situations, a container rootfs remained busy during container removal. This typically happened if a container mount point leaked into another mount namespace. As a consequence, container removal failed. To fix this bug, a new docker daemon option "dm.use\_deferred\_deletion" has been provided. If set to true, this option will defer the container rootfs deletion. The user will see success on container removal but the actual thin device backing the rootfs will be deleted later when it is not busy anymore. (BZ#1190492)
* Previously, the Docker unit file had the "Restart" option set to "on-failure". Consequently, the docker daemon was forced to restart even in cases where it couldn't be started because of configuration or other issues and this situation forced unnecessary restarts of the docker-storage-setup service in a loop. This also caused real error messages to be lost due to so many restarts. To fix this bug, "Restart=on-failure" has been replaced with "Restart=on-abnormal" in the docker unit file. As a result, the docker daemon will not automatically restart if it fails with an unclean exit code. (BZ#1319783)
* Previously, the request body was incorrectly read twice by the docker daemon and consequently, an EOF error was returned. To fix this bug, the code which incorrectly read the request body the first time has been removed. As a result, the EOF error is no longer returned and the body is correctly read when really needed. (BZ#1329743)

Enhancement(s):

* The /usr/bin/docker script now calls /usr/bin/docker-current or /usr/bin/docker-latest based on the value of the sysconfig variable DOCKERBINARY present in /etc/sysconfig/docker. /usr/bin/docker and /etc/sysconfig/docker provided by the docker-common package allow the admin to configure which docker client binary gets called. /usr/bin/docker will call /usr/bin/docker-latest by default when docker is not installed. If docker is installed, /usr/bin/docker will call /usr/bin/docker-current by default, unless DOCKERBINARY is set to /usr/bin/docker-latest in /etc/sysconfig/docker. This way, you can use docker-latest or docker without the need to check which version of the daemon is currently running. (BZ#1328219)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

**Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):**

Running under VirtualBox through Vagrant.

**Steps to reproduce the issue:**

1. On docker host:

   `vagrant@jorddev:~$ docker run --rm -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash`
2. In the just-started container:

   `root@fb5fa3be8269:/# echo '31337:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd`
3. In another terminal on the same docker host:

   `vagrant@jorddev:~$ sudo docker exec -it --user 31337 sad_jones /bin/bash`

**Describe the results you received:**

```
root@fb5fa3be8269:/# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

**Describe the results you expected:**

It should show my user id as 31337, not 0.

**Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):**

This could let image creators create malicious images which when run with a specific user id grant root in the container, and thus root to any mounted volumes.

libcontainer: user: always treat numeric ids numerically

```
Most shadow-related tools don't treat numeric ids as potential
usernames, so change our behaviour to match that. Previously, using an
explicit specification like 111:222 could result in the UID and GID not
being 111 and 222 respectively (which is confusing).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Most shadow-related tools don't treat numeric ids as potential

usernames, so change our behaviour to match that. Previously, using an

explicit specification like 111:222 could result in the UID and GID not

being 111 and 222 respectively (which is confusing).

Do you think it'd be worthwhile or possible to do this test/conversion once instead of once per `passwd` entry like it's doing now, plus one more time outside this filter if we don't find the UID in the file?

You're right, I didn't consider the fact that it doesn't shortcircuit anymore. But since it's a constant for the entire function we can definitely refactor our essentially all calls to `Atoi`. I'm just not sure what to do about negative UIDs.

| Other than the fact that we're hitting `Atoi` at least once per every line in both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` unnecessarily, this LGTM (and I'm OK with the implementation if there isn't a clean way to switch that code) 👍 |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c0)  Jeremy Eder    2016-04-25 12:50:04 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Trying to run openonload (a userspace networking stack) in a container.  # docker run -d label:disable --device=/dev/onload --device=/dev/onload_epoll --net=host r7perf_onload onload netserver  type=AVC msg=audit(1461588083.314:5082): avc:  denied  { ioctl } for  pid=13623 comm="netserver" path="onload:[tcp:1:3]" dev="onloadfs" ino=3135700 scontext=system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0:c671,c870 tcontext=system_u:object_r:unlabeled_t:s0 tclass=sock_file  Disabling selinux for this container as a workaround.  # docker run -d --security-opt label:disable --device=/dev/onload --device=/dev/onload_epoll --net=host r7perf_onload netserver  ...  Would we be interested in adding support for this to our policy files or would the vendor have to carry this ?  #============= svirt_lxc_net_t ============== allow svirt_lxc_net_t unlabeled_t:sock_file ioctl;   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c3)  Daniel Walsh    2016-05-03 13:18:53 UTC  ``` I think your first example is wrong.  docker run -d --security-opt label:disable --device=/dev/onload --device=/dev/onload_epoll --net=host r7perf_onload onload netserver  Your example is missing the --security-opt flag?  The process inside of the container is still running with a locked down svirt_lxc_net_t?   The problem here is that the device did not get a label that SELinux is allowed to write.  What version of docker are you using?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c4)  Jeremy Eder    2016-05-03 13:22:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c3)) > I think your first example is wrong. >  > docker run -d --security-opt label:disable --device=/dev/onload > --device=/dev/onload_epoll --net=host r7perf_onload onload netserver >  > Your example is missing the --security-opt flag?

So this is an SELinux issue.  It looks like we need some support for labeling the "onloadfs" file system?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c8)  Daniel Walsh    2016-05-03 14:23:27 UTC  ```  type=AVC msg=audit(1461588083.314:5082): avc:  denied  { ioctl } for  pid=13623 comm="netserver" path="onload:[tcp:1:3]" dev="onloadfs" ino=3135700 scontext=system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0:c671,c870 tcontext=system_u:object_r:unlabeled_t:s0 tclass=sock_file  Since these devices have labels, Could this be a kernel issue?  How does one get a label on this sock_file?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c9)  Jeremy Eder    2016-05-03 14:40:00 UTC  ``` onloadfs is created by an out of tree kernel module:  <https://github.com/jeremyeder/openonload/blob/af9408f6df1bb19659f70661cfeb58a981b4a053/src/driver/linux_onload/onloadfs.c>  This is why I am wondering if we need to ask Solarflare to carry the labeling patch in their distribution.  The other thing is that most of those customers disable selinux, but they'd probably be receptive or at least understanding.  I've cc'd Davor Frank from Solarflare on this BZ.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c10)  Stephen Smalley    2016-05-03 14:43:41 UTC  ``` Add a genfscon onloadfs entry to policy?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c11)  Daniel Walsh    2016-05-03 15:32:47 UTC  ``` We could try that, and see if it fixes the issue.  Getting an updated policy into rhel could be difficult, but Miroslav, could probably throw together a scratch build.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c12)  Stephen Smalley    2016-05-03 15:38:28 UTC  ``` Looks like it should work based on the code referenced above, which calls d_instantiate(), which SELinux already hooks (security_d_instantiate -> selinux_d_instantiate) to set the incore inode security label.  Obviously you'll need to allow access from svirt_lxc_net_t to whatever type is assigned to onloadfs inodes.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c13)  Daniel Walsh    2016-05-03 17:32:13 UTC  ``` Sure.  As long as we don't have to give access to unlabeled_t.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c14)  Daniel Walsh    2016-06-03 18:55:40 UTC  ``` Added policy for defining onloadfs.  <https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux-policy/pull/129>   Once this is merged, I will add the policy to docker-selinux.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c15)  Daniel Walsh    2016-06-07 11:42:29 UTC  ``` Looks like it got merged into rawhide policy.  Lukas can we get this back ported to rhel7?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c16)  Lukas Vrabec    2016-06-07 11:51:38 UTC  ``` Yes,   Fix will be in: selinux-policy-3.13.1-77.el7  BZ from selinux-policy side: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1342930](show_bug.cgi?id=1342930 "CLOSED ERRATA - openonload applications fail inside containers")   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c19)  Daniel Walsh    2016-09-23 12:39:37 UTC  ``` Looks like this should be fixed in 7.3.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c20)  Chris Evich    2016-09-27 18:56:12 UTC  ``` Note: No idea w/n the policy actually works as reported, but it is defined in the latest 7.3 build (snap 5):  # rpm -q selinux-policy selinux-policy-3.13.1-100.el7.noarch  # strings /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.30 | grep -i onload onload_fs_t onloadfs   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1330141#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-04 09:07:50 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1329743#c0)  Abe Music    2016-04-22 20:04:02 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Installed latest version of docker (1.9.1-25) and python-docker-py (1.7.2-1).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=976777#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2016-04-22 07:42:24 UTC  ``` rh#1329450  Container launch does not distinguish between numeric UIDs and string usernames. A malicious image can provide a username to UID mapping at a high privileged level. This means that innoculous looking launches such as:      docker -u 1000 ...  actually result in the image processes running as root.  This ambiguity also confuses OpenShift's UID-based controls.  Acknowledgments: Mrunal Patel (Red Hat)  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1329450> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-3697> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=976777#c1)  Aleksa Sarai   2016-04-22 07:51:55 UTC  ``` This was fixed in libcontainer here[1], and in Docker upstream here[2] (which was a vendor update). We can backport this patch to 1.10.3, which (I believe) was just released.

It also affects `USER` directives in Dockerfiles. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=976777#c3)  Aleksa Sarai   2016-04-22 12:27:29 UTC  ``` I've opened mr#113322, which fixes this issue for SLE.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**".

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1329450#c0)  Trevor Jay    2016-04-22 01:54:56 UTC  ``` Container launch does not distinguish between numeric UIDs and string usernames. A malicious image can provide a username to UID mapping at a high privileged level. This means that innoculous looking launches such as:      docker -u 1000 ...  actually result in the image processes running as root.  This ambiguity also confuses OpenShift's UID-based controls.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1329450#c1)  Trevor Jay    2016-04-22 02:00:48 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Mrunal Patel (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1329450#c4)  Trevor Jay    2016-04-22 02:03:38 UTC  ```  Created docker tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1329454](show_bug.cgi?id=1329454 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-3697 docker: privilege escalation via confusion of usernames and UIDs [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1329450#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-05-12 15:17:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2016:1034 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1034.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1329450#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-04 09:07:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2016:2634 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2634.html>   ``` |  |
