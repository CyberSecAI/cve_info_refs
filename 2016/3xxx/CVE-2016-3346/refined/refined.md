Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3346:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Windows enforces permissions when a specially crafted DLL is loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect permission enforcement:** Windows fails to properly enforce permissions when a specially crafted DLL is loaded, allowing unauthorized code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows a locally authenticated attacker to run arbitrary code with system administrator privileges.
- **Full System Control:** With elevated privileges, the attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack requires the attacker to create and implement a malicious DLL.
- The attacker needs to already have the ability to execute code on the target system, indicating a post-compromise scenario.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be locally authenticated on the target system.
- The attacker must be able to create a malicious DLL and execute code on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content references Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-110, which addresses multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2016-3346.
- The update addresses CVE-2016-3346 by correcting how Windows enforces permissions.
- The content suggests that a malicious DLL must be created and implemented for successful exploitation.
