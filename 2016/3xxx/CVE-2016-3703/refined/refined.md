Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of origin validation within the OpenShift Enterprise API proxy. This allows an attacker to load untrusted content via a GET request to the API proxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Origin Validation:** The API proxy fails to properly validate the origin of the content being loaded, leading to a potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) like attacks.
*   **Insecure API Access:**  Anonymous access granted to the service/proxy or pod/proxy API for a specific pod, coupled with an authorized access\_token in the query parameter, creates an opportunity for exploitation.
*   **localStorage Exposure:** The web console and API server being hosted on the same domain allows malicious content loaded through the API proxy to access the browser's localStorage, where API credentials are stored.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can access API credentials stored in the browser's localStorage of a logged-in user.
*   **Account Takeover:** With stolen credentials, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's OpenShift Enterprise account.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker with elevated access could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to the API proxy with an authorized `access_token` in the query parameters.
*   **Anonymous API Access:** The attacker exploits a misconfigured environment where anonymous access is permitted to the service/proxy or pod/proxy API for a specific pod.
*   **Same-Domain Hosting:** Exploitation is possible when the web console and API server share the same domain, allowing the attacker's script to access the browser's localStorage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the OpenShift Enterprise instance.
*   **`access_token`:** The attacker must have a valid `access_token` that can be passed in the query parameter.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the specific API endpoint used for the service/proxy or pod/proxy API.
*   **Misconfigured Environment:** The OpenShift environment has to be misconfigured to allow anonymous access to the targeted API endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jordan Liggitt (Red Hat).
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" in severity.
*   Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2016:1094 for OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 and RHSA-2016:1095 for OpenShift Enterprise 3.1) to address this issue.
*   The fix involves addressing the origin validation flaw.
* The provided content includes a fix for the issue in Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 and 3.2.
