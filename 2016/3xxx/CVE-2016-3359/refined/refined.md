  "vulnerability_information": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3359",
    "description": "Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption leading to remote code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. With administrative privileges, the attacker could take full control of the system, install software, modify data, and create new user accounts.",
     "attack_vector": "Exploitation requires a user to open a specially crafted file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office. This can occur through email attachments or by visiting a malicious or compromised website hosting the crafted file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must craft a malicious file and convince a user to open it. This can be achieved through social engineering, like phishing emails or enticing links on compromised websites. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file."
