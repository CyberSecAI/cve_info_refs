Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3104:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how MongoDB versions 2.4 and 2.6 (when using 2.4-style users) handle authentication attempts against non-existent databases. Specifically, when a client tries to authenticate against a database that doesn't exist, the server creates an in-memory representation of that database even if authentication fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unnecessary Database Creation:** The server creates in-memory databases even when authentication fails.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** The vulnerability lies in the uncontrolled in-memory database creation, leading to memory exhaustion

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly authenticating against non-existent databases will cause the `mongod` process to consume excessive memory.
- **Service Termination:** If memory consumption becomes too high, the operating system's OOM (Out-Of-Memory) killer might terminate the `mongod` process, leading to a denial of service.
- **Data Loss (Indirect):** Although the created databases are transient and deleted on restart, the service unavailability can impact operations and potentially lead to data inconsistencies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Attackers can remotely trigger the vulnerability by sending authentication requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access to the MongoDB server:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the MongoDB server's port.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Ability to send authentication requests:** The attacker must be able to send specially crafted authentication requests to the server, specifying a database that doesn't exist.

**Affected Versions:**
- MongoDB 2.4
- MongoDB 2.6 when running with 2.4-style user authentication schema.

**Unaffected Versions:**
- MongoDB 2.6 with 2.6-style users
- MongoDB 3.0 and newer
