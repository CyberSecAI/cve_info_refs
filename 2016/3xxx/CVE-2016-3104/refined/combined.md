### Description

**Issue Status as of Jun 02, 2016**

**ISSUE SUMMARY**

Authenticating against non-existent database that contains 2.4-style users creates database in memory.

This bug has been assigned [CVE-2016-3104](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-3104).

**USER IMPACT**

In-memory representation of databases increases memory consumption in mongod. In very extreme cases this increase in memory consumption may cause mongod to run out of memory and either terminate or be terminated by the operating system’s OOM killer.

**AFFECTED VERSIONS**

This issue only affects the following MongoDB versions when running with authentication under the following conditions:

* MongoDB version 2.4
* MongoDB version 2.6 when running with 2.4-style users

To find out if your deployment has 2.4-style users please [see the documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.0-compatibility/#security-changes) on auth schemas.

Neither MongoDB 2.6 with 2.6-style users, nor MongoDB 3.0 and newer are affected by this issue.

**WORKAROUNDS AND REMEDIATION**

There’s no workaround for this issue in MongoDB 2.4. Users affected by this issue should consider upgrading to a newer version.

MongoDB 2.6 users affected by this issue should complete the 2.6 upgrade process and [upgrade their authorization schema](https://docs.mongodb.com/v2.6/release-notes/2.6-upgrade-authorization/).

For more information on remediation please see the [Security Manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/security/) and the [Security Checklist](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1324496#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-04-06 13:27:16 UTC  ``` It was reported that it is possible for remote unauthenticated attackers to cause the host to kill mongoDB service due to memory exhaustion. This issue can be triggered by making multiple database creation requests. Even if authentication fails, the requested database is created in memory. Eventually, the host runs out of memory and kills Mongo service resulting in a denial of service. After service restart, all created databases are deleted.  The issue was identified in versions 2.4 and 2.6. The issue was found to be not reproducible on 3.0.11 and 3.2.4.  External references: <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-24378>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1324496#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-04-06 13:27:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Simon Budail Essard, Philippe Jacquot   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1324496#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-12-08 06:52:00 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-24378>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1324496#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-12-08 07:55:23 UTC  ``` Note on exploitation on mongodb-2.6:  This issue does not affect all MongoDB 2.6 installations; it only affects MongoDB 2.6 installations in circumstances where they first had a MongoDB 2.4 installation with authentication enabled, upgraded to 2.6, and did not complete a full upgrade (i.e., did not migrate the authuser-schema). More details are provided in the above SERVER ticket.  <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-24378>   ``` |  |
