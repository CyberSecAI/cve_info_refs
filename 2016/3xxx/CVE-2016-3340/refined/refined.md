- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver improperly handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of objects in memory by the CLFS driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can run processes in an elevated context, gaining complete control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack scenario where an attacker would need to log on to the system and run a specially crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to log on to the system and execute a specially crafted application.
