{
  "CVE-2016-3705": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `xmlParserEntityCheck` and `xmlParseAttValueComplex` functions in `parser.c` in libxml2 do not properly increment the recursion depth counter when parsing XML data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper recursion tracking",
      "Stack exhaustion"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A context-dependent attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted XML document with many nested entity references, leading to stack consumption and application crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted XML document with a large number of nested entity references.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted XML document to an application using the vulnerable libxml2 library."
