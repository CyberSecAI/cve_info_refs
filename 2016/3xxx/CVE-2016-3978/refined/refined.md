  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The FortiOS web UI accepts a user-controlled input via the 'redir' parameter, which is then used in a redirect. This input is not properly sanitized.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Open Redirect",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary malicious site (Open Redirect), or execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser (XSS).",
  "Attack vectors": "The 'redir' parameter in the FortiOS web login portal is vulnerable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious 'redir' parameter and entice a user to visit the crafted URL."
