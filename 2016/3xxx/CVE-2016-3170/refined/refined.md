Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Drupal handles user email addresses in certain configurations. Specifically, when a site allows users to log in using their email addresses instead of usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The "forgot password" functionality can reveal the username associated with a particular email address if email login is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker can potentially discover usernames by using email addresses if email login is enabled which compromises user privacy and anonymity especially in scenarios where usernames are intentionally obfuscated.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector involves utilizing the "forgot password" functionality of the application and providing a user's email address to check if the application provides the username associated with it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs no specific privileges, just have to know a valid email address which is registered to the application.
-   The target site needs to have a configuration where users can log in using their email addresses instead of usernames.
-   A contributed module must be installed to permit login with an email address.
-   This vulnerability is more relevant on sites where usernames are typically chosen to hide the users' real-life identities.
