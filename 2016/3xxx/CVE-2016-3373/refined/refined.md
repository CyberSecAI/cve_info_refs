Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windows Kernel API improperly allowing a user to access sensitive registry information. Specifically, the `RegLoadAppKey` API, designed to load per-application registry hives, has a flaw where its intended security restrictions can be bypassed through recursive enumeration of the registry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Improper Access Control:** The Windows Kernel API fails to properly restrict access to per-application registry hives. Although these hives are intended to be non-enumerable and accessible only through specific permissions checks on the hive file, the vulnerability allows for enumeration through recursive registry access.
2.  **Incorrect Assumption of Security:** There is an assumption that the inability to enumerate the hives directly through the attachment point is sufficient security to prevent abuse. This assumption is incorrect because the vulnerability allows recursive enumeration.
3. **Excessive Permissions:** Some of the per-app hives, especially those used for settings, have default DACLs that grant "Everyone" and "ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES" full access, leading to vulnerabilities. This contradicts the intent of per-app hives, which should be isolated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A locally authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to user account information that is not intended for them, potentially leading to privilege escalation. While not explicitly detailed how, the potential for privilege escalation is high.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read/write settings data from other running applications, potentially even across different users on the same machine (e.g., on a Terminal Server). This enables an attacker to read the settings of other users' running Immersive Applications, which is a significant information disclosure issue.
*   **Cross-User Data Access:** On a terminal server environment, one user could read/write to settings of another user's applications.
*  **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although not fully investigated, the vulnerability in Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) hive allows write access, leading to a potential attack vector for privilege escalation.
* **Abuse of System Services**: System services such as Background Tasks Infrastructure Service and Program Compatibility Assistant use per-app hives. This can be potentially exploited to elevate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to execute the specially crafted application.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The vulnerability is triggered by running a specially crafted application that exploits the improper registry access handling.
*   **Recursive Enumeration:** The attacker needs to perform recursive enumeration of registry keys to access sensitive registry hives.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute an application on the target system.
* **Understanding of the Registry Structure**: The attacker needs to know how to navigate the registry structure to reach the vulnerable hives.

**Additional Notes from Exploit-DB:**

* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) in C# demonstrates the ability to enumerate per-app registry hives and identify the PCA cache hive.
* The vulnerability affects Windows 10 10586 (not tested), 8.1 Update 2, and Windows 7.
* The root cause is that the security boundary for accessing app-specific registry hives was based on the assumption that those hives could not be enumerated.
* The default DACL on settings hives in immersive applications grants broad access, exposing more data because of the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2016-3373 is a Windows Kernel elevation of privilege vulnerability stemming from improper access control of per-application registry hives. It allows a local attacker to access sensitive registry data, leading to potential information disclosure and privilege escalation.
