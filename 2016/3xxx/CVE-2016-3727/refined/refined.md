Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3727:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the Jenkins API. Specifically, the API endpoint `/computer/(master)/api/xml` did not properly restrict access based on the intended permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Users with the 'extended read' permission for the built-in node (master) were able to access global Jenkins configuration through the vulnerable API endpoint, even though they lacked explicit permissions for that configuration. This allowed for unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability led to information disclosure, specifically exposing details about the Jenkins security realm configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** Attackers with the 'extended read' permission for a node could potentially view sensitive Jenkins configurations, including those related to security settings and user management.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Exposure of security realm configurations could be leveraged by attackers to identify weaknesses in the overall security posture of the Jenkins instance, which could then enable other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network access to the Jenkins instance, specifically by crafting requests to the `/computer/(master)/api/xml` API endpoint.
- **API Access:**  Exploitation relies on making use of the Jenkins API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account with 'Extended Read' Permission:** An attacker needs a valid user account that has the 'extended read' permission for the master node. This would typically be a user who can view the configuration of the master node, but not necessarily the global configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Resolution:** The fix for this vulnerability involves the vulnerable API endpoint now unconditionally sending an HTTP 400 Bad Request when accessed, effectively disabling access through this endpoint. There is no workaround for this fix.
- **Severity:** This vulnerability is considered medium severity, due to the risk of sensitive information disclosure and potential for further compromise.
- **Affected Versions:** All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 2.2 and all Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 1.651.1 are affected.
