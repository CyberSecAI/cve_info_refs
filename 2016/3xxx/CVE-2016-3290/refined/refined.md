- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper access of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They could also leverage compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content by adding malicious content. The attacker needs to entice a user to view the malicious content. This could be achieved through email or instant messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a website and convince a user to visit it using Internet Explorer. They do not need any specific system privileges before the exploit.
