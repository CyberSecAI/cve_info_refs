Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `TailLogServlet` class of dotCMS. Specifically, the servlet allows an authenticated administrator user to specify a filename to be displayed via the `fileName` parameter in the URL. The application attempts to restrict access to files within the designated log directory. However, it inadequately sanitizes the provided filename, allowing for directory traversal using ".." sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of the `fileName` parameter, allowing an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended log directory.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application only checks the file extension against a regex (`.*\.log$|.*\.out$`), but not the path itself. This allows an attacker to provide a path including ".." and access arbitrary files on the server, as long as they end with `.log` or `.out`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read any file on the server filesystem that the dotCMS application user has permissions to access. If the dotCMS application is running as root, this could include sensitive system files.
*   **Information Exposure:** By reading arbitrary files, an attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, source code, and system logs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `dotTailLogServlet` endpoint, including a `fileName` parameter with directory traversal sequences.
    Example:  `http://localhost:8080/dotTailLogServlet/?fileName=../../../../../../../../var/log/system.log`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Admin User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator privileges within the dotCMS system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable dotCMS instance.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `dotCMS 3.5 Beta` and likely earlier versions.
*   The fix is included in `dotCMS 3.3.2` and `3.5`.
*   The advisory recommends preventing access to the log file viewer and not running dotCMS under the ROOT account on any host machine.
