| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c0)  Randy Barlow    2013-09-01 22:07:24 UTC  ``` I learned during our refactor this weekend that we have ca.{crt,key} files in our git repository that our RPM packages and installs on every Pulp installation. This is very bad.  To make matters worse, there is only a tiny paragraph in our docs that mention quite casually that you should make your own SSL certificates. This is putting our users at risk, particularly ones who don't know the full depths of our use of CA certificates. This is particularly bad due to the understated nature of the documentation telling users that they can change the CA if they want to.  A very easy solution would be to have the %post% section of our spec file autogenerate a new CA certificate and key when the package is installed. This has the benefit of still making it easy to install Pulp for newcomers, while also not putting those users at risk to man in the middle attacks. It's still exactly the same effort for the user to install their own CA, if they wish.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c1)  Jeff Ortel    2013-09-19 23:07:40 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/627>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c2)  Jeff Ortel    2013-09-26 15:36:36 UTC  ``` build: 2.3.0-0.15.alpha   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c3)  Preethi Thomas    2013-09-30 12:54:50 UTC  ``` verified [root@pulp-v2-server ~]# rpm -qa pulp-server pulp-server-2.3.0-0.16.alpha.el6.noarch [root@pulp-v2-server ~]#   [root@pulp-v2-server ~]# ls -l /etc/pki/pulp/ total 20 -rw-r-----. 1 root   apache 1082 Sep 27 08:33 ca.crt -rw-r-----. 1 root   apache 1675 Sep 27 08:33 ca.key drwxr-xr-x. 2 apache apache 4096 Sep 26 16:44 content drwxr-xr-x. 2 root   root   4096 Sep 27 09:52 nodes drwxr-xr-x. 3 root   root   4096 Sep 19 15:03 qpid [root@pulp-v2-server ~]#   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c4)  Preethi Thomas    2013-12-09 14:31:29 UTC  ``` Pulp 2.3 released.   ``` |  |

**Description**

Security researcher Sander Bos contacted the Pulp team to notify us

that the pulp-gen-nodes-certificate script suffers from the same

exploit as was found in CVE-2016-3095, namely that the $TMP

directory that contains the Nodes private key was created in an

unsafe manner. The fix is to use mktemp -d to safely create the

directory.

Thanks to Sander Bos for taking the time to carefully inspect the

Pulp codebase and for writing a wonderfully detailed report

describing the issue and the fix for it.

Credit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently

reporting this issue.

# CVE-2016-3108[¶](#CVE-2016-3108)

Safely create tmp dir for the Nodes certificate (CVE-2016-3108).

Security researcher Sander Bos contacted the Pulp team to notify us
that the pulp-gen-nodes-certificate script suffers from the same
exploit as was found in CVE-2016-3095, namely that the $TMP
directory that contains the Nodes private key was created in an
unsafe manner. This commit contains his proposed fix to use
mktemp -d to safely create the directory.

Additionally, I added a set -e so that the script would exit upon
error.

Thanks to Sander Bos for taking the time to carefully inspect the
Pulp codebase and for writing a wonderfully detailed report
describing the issue and the fix for it.

CVE-2016-3107 & CVE-2016-3108: Safely generate Nodes certificate.

This commit fixes two CVEs.

# CVE-2016-3107[¶](#CVE-2016-3107)

Install Node certificate with 640, apache owned (CVE-2016-3107).

Prior to this commit, the Node certificate had been installed
world-readable:

$ ls -lah /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/
total 4.0K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 21 Apr 8 16:37 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 90 Apr 8 16:37 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 3.2K Apr 8 16:37 node.crt

|  |  | Pulp 2.8 Release Notes |
|  |  | ====================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Pulp 2.8.3 |
|  |  | ========== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | .. warning:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | User action is required to address the CVEs associated with this upgrade! Read the upgrade |
|  |  | instructions below. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 2.8.3 is a security and bugfix release. Included in the list of :fixedbugs:`2.8.3` |
|  |  | are a number of CVEs: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3106 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1827>`\_: Insecure creation of temporary directory |
|  |  | when generating new CA key |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3107 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1833>`\_: Node certificate containing private key |
|  |  | stored in world-readable file |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3108 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1830>`\_: Insecure temporary file used when |
|  |  | generating certificate for Pulp Nodes |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3111 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1837>`\_: pulp.spec generates its RSA keys for |
|  |  | message signing insecurely |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3112 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1834>`\_: Pulp consumer private keys are |
|  |  | world-readable |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Additionally, `CVE-2013-7450 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1003326>`\_ was |
|  |  | announced during this release cycle, even though it was fixed in Pulp 2.3.0. \*Users who have |
|  |  | upgraded from Pulp < 2.3.0 may still be vulnerable, action may be required.\* |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Upgrade instructions |
|  |  | -------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Some of the CVEs require user interaction to remedy. Begin by upgrading to Pulp 2.8.3:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp\_workers pulp\_resource\_manager pulp\_celerybeat goferd |
|  |  | $ sudo yum upgrade |
|  |  | $ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp\_workers pulp\_resource\_manager pulp\_celerybeat goferd |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3112 (Part I) |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The client certificate for consumers (``/etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem``) was installed |
|  |  | world-readable. This issue has been fixed for new certificates issued to consumers, but upgrading to |
|  |  | 2.8.3 does not modify the permissions of old certificates. It is recommended that users regenerate |
|  |  | the certificates by unregistering and re-registering all consumers. However, the consumers cannot be |
|  |  | re-registered until CVE-2013-7450, CVE-2016-3095, CVE-2016-3106, and CVE-2016-3111 have been |
|  |  | addressed below. Thus, start by unregistering each of your consumers (we will return to this CVE |
|  |  | later to re-register them):: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-consumer unregister |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2013-7450, CVE-2016-3095, and CVE-2016-3106 |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | There are two reasons that you may wish to regenerate Pulp's internal certificate authority key and |
|  |  | certificate. First, if your Pulp installation started off as a version lower than 2.3.0 and you are |
|  |  | still using the default CA certificate and key that was distributed with those versions of Pulp, |
|  |  | then you are still vulnerable to CVE-2013-7450 and it is crucial that you generate a new unique CA. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Additionally, CVE-2016-3095 and CVE-2016-3106 made it possible for local attackers to read the CA |
|  |  | key during generation (which happens during the initial installation of Pulp or any time an admin |
|  |  | ran ``pulp-gen-ca-certificate``). If you are concerned that a local user may have read that CA key |
|  |  | during the brief window that it was visible it is recommended that you regenerate the key and cert. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To regenerate the certificate, you should remove the old one and then you may use the provided |
|  |  | utility:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # First remove the old files so that the new files get the correct SELinux context. |
|  |  | $ sudo rm /etc/pki/pulp/ca.\* |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-gen-ca-certificate |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you choose not to perform the CA regeneration, you may wish to apply the correct SELinux type to |
|  |  | your existing CA files as versions of Pulp < 2.8.3 generated this file with an incorrect SELinux |
|  |  | type. You don't need to do this if you removed the old file and regenerated it with |
|  |  | ``pulp-gen-ca-certificate``. You can run restorecon recursively on the /etc/pki/pulp folder to fix |
|  |  | the SELinux label on your existing CA certificate:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # You only need to do this if you didn't regenerate the CA above. |
|  |  | $ sudo restorecon -R /etc/pki/pulp |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3107 and CVE-2016-3108 |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For Nodes users, the /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/node.crt file was installed world-readable. Users are |
|  |  | recommended to remove this file and regenerate it by running pulp-gen-nodes-certificate:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # It is important to remove the file so that the new file has the correct permissions. |
|  |  | $ sudo rm /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/node.crt |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-gen-nodes-certificate |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3111 |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Both the RSA key pair for the Pulp server and RSA key pair for each Pulp consumer was generated |
|  |  | during installation in an insecure directory. This vulnerability allowed a local attacker to read |
|  |  | the private key portion of the key pair. These keys are used for message authentication between the |
|  |  | Pulp server and the Pulp consumers. If you are concerned that a local attacker was able to read |
|  |  | these keys, you can regenerate them. We do not ship a script to perform this, but the process is |
|  |  | straight-forward. For the Pulp server, do the following as root:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ cd /etc/pki/pulp/ |
|  |  | $ rm rsa.key rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ umask 077 |
|  |  | $ openssl genrsa -out rsa.key <bits> # <bits> should be at least 2048 |
|  |  | $ openssl rsa -in rsa.key -pubout > rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ chgrp apache rsa.key rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ chmod 640 rsa.key # Apache must be able to read the private key |
|  |  | $ chmod 644 rsa\_pub.key # The public key is world-readable as it is served via Apache |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The Pulp consumer key is similar:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ cd /etc/pki/pulp/consumer/ |
|  |  | $ rm rsa.key rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ umask 077 |
|  |  | $ openssl genrsa -out rsa.key <bits> # <bits> should be at least 2048 |
|  |  | $ openssl rsa -in rsa.key -pubout > rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3112 (Part II) |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Now that we have regenerated the server's CA certificate, we can finish re-registering each consumer |
|  |  | to Pulp:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-consumer -u <admin-username> register --consumer-id=<consumer-id> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Restart |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Pulp services are now ready to be restarted again to pick up the new certificates. For systemd |
|  |  | users:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo systemctl restart httpd pulp\_workers pulp\_resource\_manager pulp\_celerybeat goferd |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Troubleshooting |
|  |  | --------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Regenerating the CA certificate will invalidate all client certificates that were issued by the |
|  |  | old CA. All users will need to login to Pulp again to obtain a new client certificate. If you |
|  |  | forget a step, you may see one of the following error messages: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* "pulp.server.managers.auth.authentication:ERROR: Auth certificate with CN |
|  |  | [admin:admin:57155b83e779896cb3d634a4] is signed by a foreign CA" (or similar) in the server |
|  |  | log can indicate that httpd has not been restarted since the CA was replaced. |
|  |  | \* "The specified user does not have permission to execute the given command" from pulp-admin can |
|  |  | mean that the user has not logged in since the new CA was present, or that httpd has not been |
|  |  | restarted since the certificate was replaced. More generally, this error message can also mean |
|  |  | that the user is not authorized to perform the given action. |
|  |  | \* "An error occurred attempting to contact the server. More information may be found using the |
|  |  | -v flag." may be output by pulp-admin if you have restarted httpd but have not logged in again |
|  |  | to get a new CA certificate. If you provide that -v flag and see "ConnectionException: |
|  |  | (None, 'tlsv1 alert decrypt error', None)", this is likely the issue. |

### CVE-2016-3107: Node certificate containing private key stored in world-readable file

Added by [rbarlow](/users/8) [almost 9 years](/projects/pulp/activity?from=2016-04-08 "04/08/2016 10:51 PM") ago.

Updated [almost 6 years](/projects/pulp/activity?from=2019-04-15 "04/15/2019 10:32 PM") ago.

Status:CLOSED - CURRENTRELEASEPriority:NormalAssignee:[rbarlow](/users/8)Category:-Sprint/Milestone:-Start date:Due date:Estimated time:
Severity:2. MediumVersion:Platform Release:2.8.3OS:Triaged:YesGroomed:NoSprint Candidate:NoTags:Pulp 2Sprint:Quarter:

---

**Description**

The Node certificate is installed

world-readable:

```
$ ls -lah /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/
total 4.0K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 21 Apr 8 16:37 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 90 Apr 8 16:37 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 3.2K Apr 8 16:37 node.crt

```

The fix adjusts the generation script to limit the permissions

to 0640, and to adjust the group ownership to the apache group. It

also uses the -Z flag on the mv command to ensure the correct

SELinux context is used on the installed file.

Credit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently

discovering and reporting this issue.

[Revision 8571d9a0](/projects/pulp/repository/pulp/revisions/8571d9a0cd7a7cb68c8e8640d01bfbd3560509cf "Revision 8571d9a0")

CVE-2016-3107 & CVE-2016-3108: Safely generate Nodes certificate.

This commit fixes two CVEs.

# CVE-2016-3107[¶](#CVE-2016-3107)

Install Node certificate with 640, apache owned (CVE-2016-3107).

Prior to this commit, the Node certificate had been installed
world-readable:

$ ls -lah /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/
total 4.0K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 21 Apr 8 16:37 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 90 Apr 8 16:37 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 3.2K Apr 8 16:37 node.crt

This commit adjusts the generation script to limit the permissions
to 0640, and to adjust the group ownership to the apache group.

Credit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently
discovering and reporting this issue.

<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1833>

fixes [#1833](/issues/1833 "Issue: CVE-2016-3107: Node certificate containing private key stored in world-readable file (CLOSED - CURRENTRELEASE)")

# CVE-2016-3108[¶](#CVE-2016-3108)

Safely create tmp dir for the Nodes certificate (CVE-2016-3108).

Security researcher Sander Bos contacted the Pulp team to notify us
that the pulp-gen-nodes-certificate script suffers from the same
exploit as was found in CVE-2016-3095, namely that the $TMP
directory that contains the Nodes private key was created in an
unsafe manner. This commit contains his proposed fix to use
mktemp -d to safely create the directory.

Additionally, I added a set -e so that the script would exit upon
error.

Thanks to Sander Bos for taking the time to carefully inspect the
Pulp codebase and for writing a wonderfully detailed report
describing the issue and the fix for it.

Credit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently
reporting this issue.

### CVE-2016-3106: Insecure creation of temporary directory when generating new CA key

**Description**

The pulp-gen-ca-certificate script created

the Pulp CA certificate and key in /tmp/$RANDOM. This led to about

32,768 possible directories. Florian Weimer and Sander Bos

notified the Pulp team that if a user happened to own a directory

that the script chose, the user would be able to read the

certificate authority certificate. Additionally, both security

researchers concluded that there is a race condition between

creating the secure folder and the later chmod, during which an

attacker could read and hold open the inode for the $TMP

directory. This would allow an attacker to read the key that is

later written.

Sander Bos additionally concluded that an attacker could create a

DoS attack two ways: 0) By creating a symlink within the $TMP

directory that points at an important system resource, such as

/etc/passwd, or 1) By creating $TMP itself as a symlink to /,

which would cause / to be chmod'd to 0700 later in the script.

The fix adjusts the script to use mktemp -d to ensure that a

unique and safe directory is used to create the Pulp CA

certificate. Additionally, the script uses set -e so that it will

halt if there are errors.

Thanks to Florian Weimer and to Sander Bos for independently

notifying Pulp of the issue and for suggesting the needed changes

to fix it. Thanks to Adam Mariš for advising the Pulp team through

the fix. The Pulp team is thankful to the security community for

their thoughtful analysis, and for taking the time to report these

issues.

Subject: Pulp 2.8.3 Released to address multiple CVEs

Pulp 2.8.3 has been released to address multiple CVEs:

CVE-2016-3111 (Low Impact):
pulp.spec generates its RSA keys for message signing insecurely
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1837>

CVE-2016-3112 (Moderate Impact):
Pulp consumer private keys are world-readable
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1834>

CVE-2016-3107 (Moderate Impact):
Node certificate containing private key stored in world-readable file
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1833>

CVE-2016-3108 (Moderate Impact):
Insecure temporary file used when generating certificate for Pulp Nodes
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1830>

CVE-2016-3106 (Low Impact):
Insecure creation of temporary directory when generating new CA key
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1827>

Additionally, CVE-2013-7450[0] was announced during this release cycle
even though it was fixed in Pulp 2.3.0. Users who have upgraded from
Pulp < 2.3.0 may still be vulnerable, action may be required.

Users should read the release notes[1] and the mailing list
announcement[2] to learn more.

Thanks to Florian Weimer, Sander Bos, and Jeremy Cline for reporting
these issues and submitting patches.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-04-07 15:22:21 UTC  ``` It was found that fix for [CVE-2016-3095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3095) was incomplete, introducing new vulnerabilities due to insecure way of creating the temporary directory when generating new CA key.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-04-07 15:22:26 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Florian Weimer (Red Hat), Sander Bos   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-04-07 15:24:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1144778](attachment.cgi?id=1144778&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1144778&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c3)  Randy Barlow    2016-04-10 19:18:34 UTC  ``` For the record, Sander Bos has also independently reported this issue to the Pulp team. Thanks to both Florian and Sander!   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c4)  Randy Barlow    2016-04-10 19:21:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1145757](attachment.cgi?id=1145757&action=diff "Second patch proposal") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1145757&action=edit "Second patch proposal") Second patch proposal  Sander Bos recommended also setting the umask on the patch, which I think is a good addition to the patch. I am attaching that version of the patch here as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c5)  Randy Barlow    2016-04-11 12:27:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1145973](attachment.cgi?id=1145973&action=diff "Second patch proposal") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1145973&action=edit "Second patch proposal") Second patch proposal  Here is the same patch with attribution included in the AUTHORS file.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c6)  Randy Barlow    2016-04-12 13:44:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1146458](attachment.cgi?id=1146458&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1146458&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  I discovered that the umask statement in my second revision of the patch was unnecessary, so this revision removes that. Additionally, this version adds a -Z to the mv statements at the end so that the correct SELinux label will get applied when the certificate and key are moved to their final destination.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c7)  Florian Weimer    2016-04-12 14:25:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Randy Barlow from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c6)) > Created [attachment 1146458](attachment.cgi?id=1146458&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1146458&action=edit "Proposed patch") > Proposed patch >  > I discovered that the umask statement in my second revision of the patch was > unnecessary, so this revision removes that. Additionally, this version adds > a -Z to the mv statements at the end so that the correct SELinux label will > get applied when the certificate and key are moved to their final > destination.  Unfortunately, “mv -Z” has a race condition and is unsafe if the destination directory is owned by an untrusted user.  If the directory is owned by root, it is fine in this context, but I don't know if this applies here.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c8)  Randy Barlow    2016-04-12 14:54:16 UTC  ``` Hello Florian, thanks for letting me know about the race condition, I was not aware. Here are the permissions on the destination folder:  $ ls -lah /etc/pki/pulp | head -n 6 total 28K drwxr-xr-x.  3 root root   4.0K Apr 10 13:31 . drwxr-xr-x. 10 root root   4.0K Apr 10 13:29 .. -rw-r-----.  1 root apache 1.8K Apr 10 13:31 ca.crt -rw-r-----.  1 root apache 3.2K Apr 10 13:31 ca.key drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root   4.0K Apr 10 13:29 nodes  Thus this CA does get installed to a directory owned by root.  However, do you have a proposal of a better way to get the correct SELinux contexts applied that would be safe in all conditions?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c9)  Randy Barlow    2016-04-13 16:44:29 UTC  ``` This issue is filed upstream as #1827 and is fixed by PR #2527:  <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1827> <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/2527>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1324926#c10)  Andrej Nemec    2016-05-20 07:58:40 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1827> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/379>   ``` |  |

```
Prior to this commit, the pulp-gen-ca-certificate script created
the Pulp CA certificate and key in /tmp/$RANDOM. This led to about
32,768 possible directories. Florian Weimer and Sander Bos
notified the Pulp team that if a user happened to own a directory
that the script chose, the user would be able to read the
certificate authority certificate. Additionally, both security
researchers concluded that there is a race condition between
creating the secure folder and the later chmod, during which an
attacker could read and hold open the inode for the $TMP
directory. This would allow an attacker to read the key that is
later written.

Sander Bos additionally concluded that an attacker could create a
DoS attack two ways: 0) By creating a symlink within the $TMP
directory that points at an important system resource, such as
/etc/passwd, or 1) By creating $TMP itself as a symlink to /,
which would cause / to be chmod'd to 0700 later in the script.

This commit adjusts the script to use mktemp -d to ensure that a
unique and safe directory is used to create the Pulp CA
certificate. Additionally, the script uses set -e so that it will
halt if there are errors.

Thanks to Florian Weimer and to Sander Bos for independently
notifying Pulp of the issue and for suggesting the needed changes
to fix it. Thanks to Adam Mariš for advising the Pulp team through
the fix. The Pulp team is thankful to the security community for
their thoughtful analysis, and for taking the time to report these
issues.

|  |  | Pulp 2.8 Release Notes |
|  |  | ====================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Pulp 2.8.3 |
|  |  | ========== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | .. warning:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | User action is required to address the CVEs associated with this upgrade! Read the upgrade |
|  |  | instructions below. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 2.8.3 is a security and bugfix release. Included in the list of :fixedbugs:`2.8.3` |
|  |  | are a number of CVEs: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3106 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1827>`\_: Insecure creation of temporary directory |
|  |  | when generating new CA key |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3107 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1833>`\_: Node certificate containing private key |
|  |  | stored in world-readable file |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3108 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1830>`\_: Insecure temporary file used when |
|  |  | generating certificate for Pulp Nodes |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3111 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1837>`\_: pulp.spec generates its RSA keys for |
|  |  | message signing insecurely |
|  |  | \* `CVE-2016-3112 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1834>`\_: Pulp consumer private keys are |
|  |  | world-readable |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Additionally, `CVE-2013-7450 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1003326>`\_ was |
|  |  | announced during this release cycle, even though it was fixed in Pulp 2.3.0. \*Users who have |
|  |  | upgraded from Pulp < 2.3.0 may still be vulnerable, action may be required.\* |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Upgrade instructions |
|  |  | -------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Some of the CVEs require user interaction to remedy. Begin by upgrading to Pulp 2.8.3:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp\_workers pulp\_resource\_manager pulp\_celerybeat goferd |
|  |  | $ sudo yum upgrade |
|  |  | $ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp\_workers pulp\_resource\_manager pulp\_celerybeat goferd |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3112 (Part I) |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The client certificate for consumers (``/etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem``) was installed |
|  |  | world-readable. This issue has been fixed for new certificates issued to consumers, but upgrading to |
|  |  | 2.8.3 does not modify the permissions of old certificates. It is recommended that users regenerate |
|  |  | the certificates by unregistering and re-registering all consumers. However, the consumers cannot be |
|  |  | re-registered until CVE-2013-7450, CVE-2016-3095, CVE-2016-3106, and CVE-2016-3111 have been |
|  |  | addressed below. Thus, start by unregistering each of your consumers (we will return to this CVE |
|  |  | later to re-register them):: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-consumer unregister |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2013-7450, CVE-2016-3095, and CVE-2016-3106 |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | There are two reasons that you may wish to regenerate Pulp's internal certificate authority key and |
|  |  | certificate. First, if your Pulp installation started off as a version lower than 2.3.0 and you are |
|  |  | still using the default CA certificate and key that was distributed with those versions of Pulp, |
|  |  | then you are still vulnerable to CVE-2013-7450 and it is crucial that you generate a new unique CA. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Additionally, CVE-2016-3095 and CVE-2016-3106 made it possible for local attackers to read the CA |
|  |  | key during generation (which happens during the initial installation of Pulp or any time an admin |
|  |  | ran ``pulp-gen-ca-certificate``). If you are concerned that a local user may have read that CA key |
|  |  | during the brief window that it was visible it is recommended that you regenerate the key and cert. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To regenerate the certificate, you should remove the old one and then you may use the provided |
|  |  | utility:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # First remove the old files so that the new files get the correct SELinux context. |
|  |  | $ sudo rm /etc/pki/pulp/ca.\* |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-gen-ca-certificate |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you choose not to perform the CA regeneration, you may wish to apply the correct SELinux type to |
|  |  | your existing CA files as versions of Pulp < 2.8.3 generated this file with an incorrect SELinux |
|  |  | type. You don't need to do this if you removed the old file and regenerated it with |
|  |  | ``pulp-gen-ca-certificate``. You can run restorecon recursively on the /etc/pki/pulp folder to fix |
|  |  | the SELinux label on your existing CA certificate:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # You only need to do this if you didn't regenerate the CA above. |
|  |  | $ sudo restorecon -R /etc/pki/pulp |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3107 and CVE-2016-3108 |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For Nodes users, the /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/node.crt file was installed world-readable. Users are |
|  |  | recommended to remove this file and regenerate it by running pulp-gen-nodes-certificate:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # It is important to remove the file so that the new file has the correct permissions. |
|  |  | $ sudo rm /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/node.crt |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-gen-nodes-certificate |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3111 |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Both the RSA key pair for the Pulp server and RSA key pair for each Pulp consumer was generated |
|  |  | during installation in an insecure directory. This vulnerability allowed a local attacker to read |
|  |  | the private key portion of the key pair. These keys are used for message authentication between the |
|  |  | Pulp server and the Pulp consumers. If you are concerned that a local attacker was able to read |
|  |  | these keys, you can regenerate them. We do not ship a script to perform this, but the process is |
|  |  | straight-forward. For the Pulp server, do the following as root:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ cd /etc/pki/pulp/ |
|  |  | $ rm rsa.key rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ umask 077 |
|  |  | $ openssl genrsa -out rsa.key <bits> # <bits> should be at least 2048 |
|  |  | $ openssl rsa -in rsa.key -pubout > rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ chgrp apache rsa.key rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ chmod 640 rsa.key # Apache must be able to read the private key |
|  |  | $ chmod 644 rsa\_pub.key # The public key is world-readable as it is served via Apache |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The Pulp consumer key is similar:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ cd /etc/pki/pulp/consumer/ |
|  |  | $ rm rsa.key rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  | $ umask 077 |
|  |  | $ openssl genrsa -out rsa.key <bits> # <bits> should be at least 2048 |
|  |  | $ openssl rsa -in rsa.key -pubout > rsa\_pub.key |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CVE-2016-3112 (Part II) |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Now that we have regenerated the server's CA certificate, we can finish re-registering each consumer |
|  |  | to Pulp:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo pulp-consumer -u <admin-username> register --consumer-id=<consumer-id> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Restart |
|  |  | ^^^^^^^ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Pulp services are now ready to be restarted again to pick up the new certificates. For systemd |
|  |  | users:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ sudo systemctl restart httpd pulp\_workers pulp\_resource\_manager pulp\_celerybeat goferd |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Troubleshooting |
|  |  | --------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Regenerating the CA certificate will invalidate all client certificates that were issued by the |
|  |  | old CA. All users will need to login to Pulp again to obtain a new client certificate. If you |
|  |  | forget a step, you may see one of the following error messages: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* "pulp.server.managers.auth.authentication:ERROR: Auth certificate with CN |
|  |  | [admin:admin:57155b83e779896cb3d634a4] is signed by a foreign CA" (or similar) in the server |
|  |  | log can indicate that httpd has not been restarted since the CA was replaced. |
|  |  | \* "The specified user does not have permission to execute the given command" from pulp-admin can |
|  |  | mean that the user has not logged in since the new CA was present, or that httpd has not been |
|  |  | restarted since the certificate was replaced. More generally, this error message can also mean |
|  |  | that the user is not authorized to perform the given action. |
|  |  | \* "An error occurred attempting to contact the server. More information may be found using the |
|  |  | -v flag." may be output by pulp-admin if you have restarted httpd but have not logged in again |
|  |  | to get a new CA certificate. If you provide that -v flag and see "ConnectionException: |
|  |  | (None, 'tlsv1 alert decrypt error', None)", this is likely the issue. |

Message-ID: <20160418180230.GB53619@mail.corp.redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 18 Apr 2016 14:02:31 -0400
From: Randy Barlow <rbarlow@...hat.com>
To: Pulp Users <pulp-list@...hat.com>,
        OSS Security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
Subject: CVE-2013-7450: Pulp < 2.3.0 distributed the same CA key to all users

Versions of Pulp < 2.3.0 distributed the same certificate authority key and
certificate to all Pulp users[0]. This CA is used by the /login API call
(pulp-admin login uses this call) to generate and sign a client certificate.
This client certificate is then used for subsequent API calls.

Due to this vulnerability, remote attackers are able to obtain the CA key
from the Pulp git repository and use it to generate valid client certificates
for any Pulp installations that use the default CA. The Pulp documentation
did not emphasize the importance of replacing this CA for production
deployments, so there may be users who use this common CA key in production
environments.

Users are urged to replace the CA certificate and key on any Pulp
installations that began their life with a version less than 2.3.0. Upgrading
alone is not sufficient, as Pulp upgrades do not replace existing CA key
pairs. Versions of Pulp >= 2.3.0 do ship a utility (pulp-gen-ca-certificate)
that is capable of generating a new CA keypair for you, but it should be
noted that there are some known local attacks that this script is vulnerable
to as well[1][2]. The best option is to generate your own CA certificate if
you are concerned about these local attacks.

Thanks to Sander Bos for notifying the Pulp team that we had neglected to
acquire a CVE for this vulnerability at the time of its discovery.
