- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the way Microsoft Office software handles objects in memory, specifically failing to properly manage them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer rights are less impacted.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by:
    - Sending a specially crafted file to a user and convincing the user to open it (email attack).
    - Hosting a website containing a specially crafted file and enticing users to click a link and open the file (web-based attack).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted file to the victim and convince them to open it using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software. The attacker does not require any specific privileges or position within the network.
