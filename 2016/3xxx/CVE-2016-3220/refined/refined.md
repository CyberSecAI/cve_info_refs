Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Adobe Type Manager Font Driver (ATMFD.DLL), specifically in how it handles objects in memory when processing OpenType fonts. The vulnerability is triggered in the `ATMGetGlyphName` handler of the `NamedEscape` API, when retrieving a glyph name from a .OTF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Pool Corruption:** The `GetOpenTypeGlyphName` function uses a stack-like structure called `HeldDataKeys` to track the state during glyph name retrieval. A bug in the `EnsureBytesAreAvailable` function, when insufficient data is found, causes more elements to be popped from the stack than pushed, resulting in a negative value for the counter `nHeldDataKeys`. This stack underflow corrupts the font object, or nearby pool allocations, by writing a controlled value (0xffffffff by default) out-of-bounds. The attacker controls the size and offset of the data read from the .OTF file, allowing control over how many bytes are requested, which causes the out-of-bounds write.

*   **Unsafe Stack Management:** The logic within `GetOpenTypeGlyphName` combined with `EnsureBytesAreAvailable` leads to incorrect stack management, specifically the `nHeldDataKeys` counter. The intended stack usage is not properly enforced or handled when exceptions are triggered during data retrieval. This allows for the nHeldDataKeys value to be decremented to negative values leading to controlled out-of-bounds writes.

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver doesn't properly validate the size and offset of the glyph name data read from .OTF file before passing it to the EnsureBytesAreAvailable function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** By corrupting memory, the attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. This allows the attacker to take full control of the system, install programs, view, modify or delete data, and create new accounts with administrative rights.

*   **System Crash (Denial of Service):** The memory corruption can lead to a system crash or a bugcheck (BSOD).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to log on to the system and execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Specially crafted .OTF font:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted .OTF font file and potentially an .EMF file containing EMR_NAMEDESCAPE records.
*   **NamedEscape API:** The vulnerability is triggered through the undocumented `gdi32!NamedEscape` API call with a specific escape code (0x250C). The attacker has control over input and output buffers passed to the ATMFD.dll driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system. This usually requires having a valid user account.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to know about the undocumented `NamedEscape` API and the vulnerable handler in ATMFD.dll.
*   **Font crafting skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious .OTF font that exploits the vulnerability, with full control over the Name INDEX being used and the offset size.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry mentions that the vulnerability is located in the handler of code `0x250C`, which they named "ATMGetGlyphName", based on its behavior and its use in `ATMLIB!ATMGetGlyphListW` function.
*   The exploit requires knowledge of the kernel-mode address of a font object in memory, which can be bruteforced, or by other memory leak vulnerabilities.
*   The Exploit-DB entry notes that while theoretically feasible, triggering this vulnerability through Internet Explorer with embedded fonts is unlikely due to the need to reference the font object which seems impossible within that context.
*   The MS16-074 bulletin confirms the vulnerability and describes it as "an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Adobe Type Manager Font Driver (ATMFD.dll) when it fails to properly handle objects in memory.".

The provided information indicates that CVE-2016-3220 is a complex vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution, granting attackers full control of the system.
