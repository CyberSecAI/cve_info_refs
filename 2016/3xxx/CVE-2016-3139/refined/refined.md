Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the `wacom_probe` function of the Linux kernel's `wacom_sys.c` driver. This occurs when the driver attempts to access a USB device descriptor field (specifically, an endpoint descriptor), assuming that such a descriptor exists. If a crafted USB device lacks the expected endpoint descriptor or has an interface descriptor with a zero value for `bNumEndpoints`, the driver dereferences a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The `wacom_probe` function dereferences a pointer that might be NULL when processing a crafted USB device without both an interrupt-in and an interrupt-out endpoint descriptor.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver does not properly validate the `bNumEndpoints` field in the USB interface descriptor or the existence of endpoint descriptors, leading to the NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A physically proximate attacker can cause a system crash and denial of service by inserting a specially crafted USB device.
- **System Crash:** The NULL pointer dereference results in a kernel panic, requiring a system reboot to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Proximity:** Attackers require physical access to the target system to insert the malicious USB device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker must have the ability to physically connect a malicious USB device to the vulnerable system.
- **Crafted USB Device:** The attacker needs a USB device that can present specific descriptors triggering the vulnerability.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

-   **SUSE:**
    -   SUSE classifies the severity of this issue as "moderate."
    -   SUSE indicates that their kernels are vulnerable up to 3.17, but states that the issue was addressed upstream and is considered a won't fix in older versions.
    -   SUSE has released several security advisories related to this CVE across multiple products.
    -   SUSE acknowledges they will not fix all CVEs in the Linux kernel, declaring some bug classes as "won't fix".
-   **Red Hat:**
    -   Red Hat classifies this as low impact, and does not plan to backport patches for older kernels.
    -   Red Hat states that the upstream version of the driver is not vulnerable, but the RHEL versions are because of a flawed implementation.
    -   Provides a patch for their versions that addresses this issue
    -   Provides information of a publicly available proof of concept utilizing a custom usb device and arduino firmware to replicate the crash.
-   **openSUSE:** openSUSE was affected by this issue and released multiple patches and fixes.
-   **Linux Kernel:** The issue was introduced in the `drivers/input/tablet/wacom_sys.c` file of the kernel, and fixed by moving it to `drivers/hid/wacom_sys.c` in an upstream commit.
-  **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu indicates that all Ubuntu releases are not affected.
- The vulnerability occurs due to improper checks in the `wacom_probe` and `wacom_retrieve_hid_descriptor` functions, where it is assumed that endpoint descriptors exist, leading to a null pointer dereference when those do not exist.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-3139 is a moderate severity vulnerability allowing for DoS via crafted USB devices, impacting Linux kernels. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires physical access and a crafted USB device lacking certain descriptors. Patches and workarounds have been provided by multiple vendors, and the upstream driver has been re-written to avoid the vulnerability.
