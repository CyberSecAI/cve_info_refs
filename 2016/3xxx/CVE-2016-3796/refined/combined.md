# Android Security Bulletin—July 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published July 06, 2016 | Updated April 1, 2019*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Nexus firmware
images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of July 05, 2016 or later address all applicable
issues in this bulletin. Refer to the [documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices)
to learn how to check the security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on June 06,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have
been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the
[Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet,
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin defines two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to move more quickly to fix a subset of
  vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers)
  for additional information:
  + **2016-07-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with
    2016-07-01 are addressed.+ **2016-07-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
      security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with
      2016-07-01 and 2016-07-05 are addressed.
* Supported Nexus devices will be receiving a single OTA update with the
  July 05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with
  [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security Patch Levels of 2016-07-01 or later address all issues associated with
the 2016-7-01 security patch string level. Security Patch Levels of 2016-07-05
or later address all issues associated with the 2016-07-05 security patch string
level. Refer to the [help center](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705)
for instructions on how to check the security patch level. Device manufacturers
that include these updates should set the patch string level to:
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-07-01] or
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-07-05].

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch level strings?**

This bulletin has two security patch level strings in order to provide
Android partners with the flexibility to move more quickly to fix a subset of
vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. Android partners
are encouraged to fix all issues in this bulletin and use the latest security
patch level string.

Devices that use the security patch level of July 5, 2016 or newer must
include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security bulletins.

Devices that use the July 1, 2016 security patch level must include all
issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
issues reported in previous security bulletins. Devices that use July 1, 2016
security patch level may also include a subset of fixes associated with the
July 5, 2016 security patch level.

**3. How do I determine which Nexus devices are affected
by each issue?**

In the [2016-07-01](#2016-07-01-details) and
[2016-07-05](#2016-07-05-details) security vulnerability details sections,
each table has an Updated Nexus devices column that covers the range of affected
Nexus devices updated for each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Nexus devices**: If an issue affects all Nexus devices,
  the table will have “All Nexus” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
  “All Nexus” encapsulates the following
  [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player, and Pixel C.
* **Some Nexus devices**: If an issue doesn’t affect all Nexus
  devices, the affected Nexus devices are listed in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.
* **No Nexus devices**: If no Nexus devices are affected by the
  issue, the table will have “None” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table may
contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value belongs. These prefixes
map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
