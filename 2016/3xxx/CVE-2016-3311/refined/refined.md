Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-3311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver (`win32k.sys`) failing to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory handling within the `win32k.sys` driver. This can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- This can grant the attacker full control of the affected system, enabling them to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.
- The vulnerability allows for elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to log on to the system first.
- Once logged in, the attacker runs a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability in the `win32k.sys` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to log on.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute a custom application on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for all supported versions of Windows.
- The provided documents do not contain any information regarding mitigations or workarounds for the vulnerability.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- This CVE is one of four related vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-098. The others are CVE-2016-3308, CVE-2016-3309, and CVE-2016-3310, which also affect the `win32k.sys` driver.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time the bulletin was released.
