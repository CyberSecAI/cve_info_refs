{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer fail to properly secure private namespaces, leading to an elevation of privilege.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure DACL on the isolated private namespace allows any appcontainer process to gain elevated permissions.",
      "Failure to properly secure private namespaces."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain elevated permissions on the namespace directory of a vulnerable system. This can be used to gain elevated privileges in conjunction with other vulnerabilities like RCE.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access via another appcontainer process",
         "By exploiting the insecure DACL, an attacker can gain write access to resources like `IsoSpaceV2_ScopedTrusted`."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code as another appcontainer process on the same system."
