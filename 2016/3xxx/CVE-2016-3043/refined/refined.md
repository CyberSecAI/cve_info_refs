- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper HSTS implementation. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks are used to intercept communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network to intercept communications between the user and the vulnerable IBM Security Access Manager appliance.
