{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the system UI's inability to properly handle app pinning during emergency calls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of app pinning",
      "Denial of service (preventing 911 calls)"
     ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability to prevent emergency (911) calls from a locked screen. This is achieved by interfering with the app pinning feature.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. The application must also be capable of interacting with the system UI.",
     "additional_details": "The fix disables app pinning when the emergency call button or the 'return to call' button is pressed. It also brings up the in-call screen if app pinning is stopped and a call is in progress."
