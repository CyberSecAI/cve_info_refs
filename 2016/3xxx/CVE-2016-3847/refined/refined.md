Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3847:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from the Android Security Bulletin and NVIDIA security bulletin explicitly mentions CVE-2016-3847, thus confirming the relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Android:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect buffer size calculation within the NVIDIA media driver.
*   **NVIDIA:** The vulnerability is located in the NVAVP (NVIDIA Audio Video Processing) component within the NVIDIA Tegra Kernel Driver. The root cause is an incorrect calculation of the buffer size to be allocated.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Buffer Size Calculation:** Both the Android and NVIDIA contexts mention that the buffer size allocated is not correct for the intended use. This leads to a buffer overflow condition.
*   **Memory Corruption:** As the vulnerability resides within a driver, successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common impact is a denial-of-service condition, potentially leading to device instability, hang, or reboots.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to elevate privileges, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive resources or the ability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A locally installed malicious application could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Media Processing:** The vulnerability can be triggered while processing media files, as it is present in the media driver (NVAVP).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device or needs to trigger the vulnerability through a local process, potentially using a specially crafted media file.
*   **User Privileges (potentially):** While the NVIDIA bulletin states "PR:L" for "Privileges Required: Low" in the CVSS vector, it also states "PR:H" for "Privileges Required: High" in multiple CVE vectors. This might mean a malicious app running with user permissions may be sufficient.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The NVIDIA bulletin provides more details including CVSS scores for the vulnerability within their ecosystem.
*   The Android bulletin acknowledges Nathan Crandall of Tesla Motors Product Security Team for reporting this vulnerability, and assigns an "High" severity to this CVE.
*   Both bulletins state that a patch is available from the respective vendors (Google and NVIDIA).
*   This vulnerability affects multiple NVIDIA Tegra products such as Jetson TK1 and TX1 and some Nexus devices (like Nexus 9).
* The vulnerability is present in the kernel, making its impact severe.

In summary, CVE-2016-3847 is a high-severity vulnerability resulting from an incorrect buffer size calculation in the NVIDIA media driver. This vulnerability allows local attackers to trigger DoS or potentially achieve privilege escalation by exploiting the kernel driver.
