- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially leading to:
    - Installation of programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creation of new accounts with full user rights
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must first log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials to access the system and execute malicious code.
