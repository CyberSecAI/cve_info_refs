Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3259:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the JScript and VBScript scripting engines when they handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption within the scripting engines.
- Improper handling of objects in memory by JScript and VBScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, enabling them to install programs, modify data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability, then trick a user into visiting it.
- Exploitation through compromised or user-content websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content to exploit the vulnerability.
- Embedding malicious ActiveX controls: Attackers can embed ActiveX controls marked "safe for initialization" within applications or Microsoft Office documents that host the rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject content into a website accessible to the victim.
- Social engineering to convince users to visit malicious websites or open malicious files.
- The attacker would need to craft a webpage with malicious Javascript or VBScript code that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.
