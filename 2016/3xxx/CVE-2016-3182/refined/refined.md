Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a double free or heap corruption in the `opj_free` function, which is triggered by a specially crafted JPEG2000 image file. This occurs due to a flaw in memory management within the openjpeg library when handling specific image data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap corruption: Incorrect memory handling leads to the corruption of heap metadata.
- Double free: The same memory location is freed twice, leading to a crash and potentially allowing an attacker to control program execution.
- Out-of-bounds read: The address sanitizer output also points to an out-of-bounds read in the `color_esycc_to_rgb` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The double free and heap corruption leads to program crashes, causing a denial of service.
- Potential code execution: Exploiting the memory corruption could allow an attacker to gain control of the execution flow of the program and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted JPEG2000 image: An attacker crafts a malicious JPEG2000 image file.
- Image processing: When the vulnerable openjpeg library processes the malicious image, the heap corruption and double free occur, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious JPEG2000 file: The attacker needs to be able to supply the specially crafted image to a system that uses the vulnerable version of the openjpeg library. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening the file, or by targeting a server that processes user-submitted images.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported as two separate issues, CVE-2016-3181 and CVE-2016-3182, but they were later identified as stemming from the same root cause.
- A patch was released to address the vulnerability: `<https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/commit/ad593c9e0622e0d8d87228e67e4dbd36243ffd22>`.
- The vulnerability is in the executables shipped with openjpeg, while applications linked with the library are not affected.
- An old patch for CVE-2013-6045 had an issue with `comp0size` instead of `compcsize` which could cause the same crash with the reproducer for this issue, however this is not directly related to this CVE.
