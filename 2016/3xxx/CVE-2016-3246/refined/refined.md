- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user, potentially leading to full system control if the user has administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  Hosting a specially crafted website that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.
    -  Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content could be used to deliver malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince a user to visit a specially crafted website or interact with malicious content, often through social engineering tactics like emails or instant messages.
