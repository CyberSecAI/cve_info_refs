{
  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "In an Impala deployment secured with Kerberos, a malicious authenticated user can create a program that bypasses Impala and Sentry authorization mechanisms to issue internal API calls directly. That user can then query tables to which they should not have access, or alter table metadata.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Impala"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Missing authorization checks for internal API calls in Impala when secured with Kerberos.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Bypass of authorization mechanisms"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to data and alteration of table metadata.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to Impala services"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to authenticate to Impala with Kerberos, knowledge of internal APIs, and ability to send raw API calls directly to the service.",
    "remediation": "Upgrade to a patched version of CDH.",
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3131"
