| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1322710#c0)  Jan Hutař    2016-03-31 07:52:11 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There is a possible XSS when you create group with HTML via SSM or API and checks snapshot with this group join/leave.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): spacewalk-java-2.3.8-134.el6sat.noarch   How reproducible: always   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use SSM to create group:    Systems -> System Set Manager -> Groups -> Create Group      Name: '"><script>alert()</script>'      Description: whatever    OR use API to create such a group:      client.systemgroup.create(key, 'bz"><script>alert("created name")</script>', 'bz"><script>alert("created desc")</script>') 2. Choose system and make sure it have Provisioning add-on entitlement 3. Systems -> <system> -> Groups -> Join -> select group you have created    in step "1." 4. Systems -> <system> -> Provisioning -> Snapshots -> <newest_one> -> Groups 5. Ensure you see that group from step "1." there. If you are not, find    the snapshot where you can see it (if you made more actions with the    system, this might not be trivial :-))   Actual results: If you are in correct snapshot (see step "5."), JavaScript alert appears.   Expected results: Group name is properly escaped.   Additional info: Found when working on [bug 1320452](show_bug.cgi?id=1320452 "CLOSED ERRATA - (CVE-2016-3079) two XSS issues due to element creation in SSM (Perl stack) and displaying outside of it").   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1322710#c1)  Grant Gainey    2016-06-09 15:34:19 UTC  ``` CVE is public, this BZ should be as well  spacewalk.github: 23f46724d31c476f16fb1a8fe3ee113460640f43   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1322710#c4)  Radovan Drazny    2016-06-24 12:19:49 UTC  ``` Reproduced on spacewalk-java-2.3.8-142.el6sat using the reproducer from the initial report. JavaScript alert got executed as described, groups were created both by WebUI and API with the same result. Updated to spacewalk-java-2.3.8-144.el6sat, group names in snapshots are displayed correctly, JavaScript is not executed. VERIFIED   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1322710#c7)  Radovan Drazny    2016-07-19 12:18:21 UTC  ``` Re-verified with spacewalk-java-2.3.8-147 as described in the [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1322710#c4).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1322710#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-07-26 07:46:37 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# RHSA-2016:1484 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: spacewalk-java security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1484)

## Topic

An update for spacewalk-java is now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Satellite is a system management tool for Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and the remote management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.

Security Fix(es):

* A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way spacewalk-java displayed monitoring probes. An attacker can embed HTML and Javascript in the values for RHNMD User or Filesystem parameters in Satellite, allowing them to inject malicious content into the web page that is then displayed with that probe data. (CVE-2016-3080)
* A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way spacewalk-java displayed group names. An attacker can embed HTML and Javascript in the values for group names in Satellite, allowing them to inject malicious content into the web page that is then displayed when viewing the snapshot data. (CVE-2016-3097)

These issues were discovered by Jan Hutař (Red Hat).

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For this update to take effect, Red Hat Satellite must be restarted ("/usr/sbin/rhn-satellite restart").

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Satellite 5.7 x86\_64
* Red Hat Satellite 5.7 s390x

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1320942](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1320942)
  - CVE-2016-3080 spacewalk-monitoring: XSS issue in monitoring probe
