## Description

[![@micahflee](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156128?u=f9b65157aeaabb9ae9d3ab72f16ee0439eed256b&v=4&size=48)](/micahflee)[micahflee](https://github.com/micahflee)opened [on Mar 13, 2016](https://github.com/torproject/torbrowser-launcher/issues/229#issue-140532849)

Jann Horn reported a clever security issue that lets an attacker bypass PGP signature verification. Because Tor Browser Launcher uses defense in depth, an attacker would need to combine this attack with other attacks before they could succeed in an exploit. Specifically, they would need to be in a position to man-in-the-middle the download and also defeat the HTTPS connection to <https://dist.torproject.org/> or one of the mirrors.

The first time you run Tor Browser Launcher, it works like this:

* Downloads <https://dist.torproject.org/torbrowser/update_2/release/Linux_x86_64-gcc3/x/> to learn the current stable version of Tor Browser
* Uses the version, as well as the mirror URL (defaults to <https://dist.torproject.org/>), to build URLs to download the `.tar.xz` file (I'll call it $tarball) and `.tar.xz.asc` ($sigfile), and downloads them both
* Verifies the signature by running: `/usr/bin/gpg --homedir $homedir --verify $sigfile`

The problem is that `gpg --verify` can be ambiguous. If $sigfile is `tor-browser-linux64-5.5.3_en-US.tar.xz.asc`, it can either mean that that's a detached signature and the content is in `tor-browser-linux64-5.5.3_en-US.tar.xz`, or it can mean that it's the content is included in the same file.

If an attacker can MITM connections to <https://dist.torproject.org/> or whatever mirror is set, and their MITM server uses a trusted certificate, then they can replace $sigfile with a single file that contains the valid Tor Browser tarball and signature, and replace $tarball with something malicious but completely unsigned. When Tor Browser Launcher downloads $sigfile and verifies it, the verification will succeed and it will extract $tarball and execute `start-tor-browser.desktop`, which will let the attack run their arbitrary code as the current user (they could even launch a legit Tor Browser if they want to be stealthy).

The solution is to specify the content as well as the signature file when verifying the signature, e.g.: `/usr/bin/gpg --homedir $homedir --verify $sigfile $tarball`
