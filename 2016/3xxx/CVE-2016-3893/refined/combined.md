# Android Security Bulletin—September 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

ded

*Published September 06, 2016 | Updated September 12, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Nexus firmware
images have also been released to the
[Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security Patch Levels of September 06, 2016 or later address these
issues. Refer to the
[documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices)
to learn how to check the security patch level. Supported Nexus devices will
receive a single OTA update with the September 06, 2016 security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on August 05,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have
been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository. This
bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google service mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet,
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has three security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to move more quickly to fix a subset of
  vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2016-09-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-09-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-09-05**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-09-01
    and 2016-09-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-09-06**: Complete security patch level string, which
    addresses issues that were discovered after partners were notified of most
    issues in this bulletin. This security patch level string indicates that all
    issues associated with 2016-09-01, 2016-09-05, and 2016-09-06 (and all previous
    security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Nexus devices will receive a single OTA update with the September
  06, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with
  [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

the 2016-09-01 security patch string level. Security Patch Levels of 2016-09-05
or later address all issues associated with the 2016-09-05 security patch string
level. Security Patch Levels of 2016-09-06 or later address all issues
associated with the 2016-09-06 security patch string level. Refer to the
[help center](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705) for
instructions on how to check the security patch level. Device manufacturers that
include these updates should set the patch string level to:
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-09-01],
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-09-05], or
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-09-06].

**2. Why does this bulletin have three security patch level
strings?**

This bulletin has three security patch level strings so that Android partners
have the flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across
all Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all
issues in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level string.

Devices that use the September 6, 2016 security patch level or newer must
include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security bulletins. This
patch level was created to addresses issues that were discovered after partners
were first notified of most issues in this bulletin.

Devices that use September 5, 2016 security patch level must include all issues
associated with that security patch level, the September 1, 2016 security patch
level and fixes for all issues reported in previous security bulletins. Devices
that use the September 5, 2016 security patch level may also include a subset of
fixes associated with the September 6, 2016 security patch level.

Devices that use September 1, 2016 security patch level must include all issues
associated with that security patch level as well as fixes for all issues
reported in previous security bulletins. Devices that use the September 1, 2016
security patch level may also include a subset of fixes associated with the
September 5, 2016 and September 6, 2016 security patch levels.

3**. How do I determine which Nexus devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the
[2016-09-01](#2016-09-01-details),
[2016-09-05](#2016-09-05-details), and
[2016-09-06](#2016-09-06-details) security vulnerability details
sections, each table has an *Updated Nexus devices* column that covers
the range of affected Nexus devices updated for each issue. This column has a
few options:

* **All Nexus devices**: If an issue affects all Nexus devices,
  the table will have “All Nexus” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
  “All Nexus” encapsulates the following
  [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player, and Pixel C.
* **Some Nexus devices**: If an issue doesn’t affect all Nexus
  devices, the affected Nexus devices are listed in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.
* **No Nexus devices**: If no Nexus devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have “None” in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |
