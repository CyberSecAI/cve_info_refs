- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption in Internet Explorer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take full control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view it. Alternatively, they could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content/ads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious content. This could be through email/instant messenger messages or by getting the user to open a malicious email attachment.
