- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when parsing packets in IBM Cognos TM1.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker sends specially crafted packets to the IBM Cognos TM1 server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the targeted IBM Cognos TM1 server. No authentication is needed.
