Subject: CVE-2016-3713 Linux kernel: kvm: OOB r/w access issue with MSR
 0x2F8

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) with
variable Memory Type Range Registers(MTRR) support is vulnerable to an
out-of-bounds r/w access issue. It could occur while accessing processor's
MTRRs via ioctl(2) calls.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to manipulate host kernel's
memory bytes leading to information disclosure OR potentially crashing the
kernel resulting in DoS.

'CVE-2016-3713' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc. A proposed
patch is attached herein to fix this issue.

Reference:
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1332139>

This issue was reported by Mr David Matlack of Google Inc.

Thank you.

KVM: MTRR: remove MSR 0x2f8MSR 0x2f8 accessed the 124th Variable Range MTRR ever since MTRR support
was introduced by 9ba075a664df ("KVM: MTRR support").
0x2f8 became harmful when 910a6aae4e2e ("KVM: MTRR: exactly define the
size of variable MTRRs") shrinked the array of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8,
which made access to index 124 out of bounds. The surrounding code only
WARNs in this situation, thus the guest gained a limited read/write
access to struct kvm\_arch\_vcpu.
0x2f8 is not a valid VR MTRR MSR, because KVM has/advertises only 16 VR
MTRR MSRs, 0x200-0x20f. Every VR MTRR is set up using two MSRs, 0x2f8
was treated as a PHYSBASE and 0x2f9 would be its PHYSMASK, but 0x2f9 was
not implemented in KVM, therefore 0x2f8 could never do anything useful
and getting rid of it is safe.
This fixes CVE-2016-3713.

kbuild: move -Wunused-const-variable to W=1 warning level
commit c9c6837d39311b0cc14cdbe7c18e815ab44aefb1 upstream.
gcc-6 started warning by default about variables that are not
used anywhere and that are marked 'const', generating many
false positives in an allmodconfig build, e.g.:
arch/arm/mach-davinci/board-da830-evm.c:282:20: warning: 'da830\_evm\_emif25\_pins' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
arch/arm/plat-omap/dmtimer.c:958:34: warning: 'omap\_timer\_match' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/bluetooth/hci\_bcm.c:625:39: warning: 'acpi\_bcm\_default\_gpios' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/char/hw\_random/omap-rng.c:92:18: warning: 'reg\_map\_omap4' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/devfreq/exynos/exynos5\_bus.c:381:32: warning: 'exynos5\_busfreq\_int\_pm' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
drivers/dma/mv\_xor.c:1139:34: warning: 'mv\_xor\_dt\_ids' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
This is similar to the existing -Wunused-but-set-variable warning
that was added in an earlier release and that we disable by default
now and only enable when W=1 is set, so it makes sense to do
the same here. Once we have eliminated the majority of the
warnings for both, we can put them back into the default list.
We probably want this in backport kernels as well, to allow building
them with gcc-6 without introducing extra warnings.

scsi: Add intermediate STARGET\_REMOVE state to scsi\_target\_state
commit f05795d3d771f30a7bdc3a138bf714b06d42aa95 upstream.
Add intermediate STARGET\_REMOVE state to scsi\_target\_state to avoid
running into the BUG\_ON() in scsi\_target\_reap(). The STARGET\_REMOVE
state is only valid in the path from scsi\_remove\_target() to
scsi\_target\_destroy() indicating this target is going to be removed.
This re-fixes the problem introduced in commits bc3f02a795d3 ("[SCSI]
scsi\_remove\_target: fix softlockup regression on hot remove") and
40998193560d ("scsi: restart list search after unlock in

hpfs: implement the show\_options method
commit 037369b872940cd923835a0a589763180c4a36bc upstream.
The HPFS filesystem used generic\_show\_options to produce string that is
displayed in /proc/mounts. However, there is a problem that the options
may disappear after remount. If we mount the filesystem with option1
and then remount it with option2, /proc/mounts should show both option1
and option2, however it only shows option2 because the whole option
string is replaced with replace\_mount\_options in hpfs\_remount\_fs.
To fix this bug, implement the hpfs\_show\_options function that prints
options that are currently selected.

hpfs: fix remount failure when there are no options changed
commit 44d51706b4685f965cd32acde3fe0fcc1e6198e8 upstream.
Commit ce657611baf9 ("hpfs: kstrdup() out of memory handling") checks if
the kstrdup function returns NULL due to out-of-memory condition.
However, if we are remounting a filesystem with no change to
filesystem-specific options, the parameter data is NULL. In this case,
kstrdup returns NULL (because it was passed NULL parameter), although no
out of memory condition exists. The mount syscall then fails with
ENOMEM.
This patch fixes the bug. We fail with ENOMEM only if data is non-NULL.
The patch also changes the call to replace\_mount\_options - if we didn't
pass any filesystem-specific options, we don't call
replace\_mount\_options (thus we don't erase existing reported options).

UBI: Fix static volume checks when Fastmap is used
commit 1900149c835ab5b48bea31a823ea5e5a401fb560 upstream.
Ezequiel reported that he's facing UBI going into read-only
mode after power cut. It turned out that this behavior happens
only when updating a static volume is interrupted and Fastmap is
used.

UBI checks static volumes for data consistency and reads the
whole volume upon first open. If the volume is found erroneous
users of UBI cannot read from it, but another volume update is
possible to fix it. The check is performed by running
ubi\_eba\_read\_leb() on every allocated LEB of the volume.
For static volumes ubi\_eba\_read\_leb() computes the checksum of all
data stored in a LEB. To verify the computed checksum it has to read
the LEB's volume header which stores the original checksum.
If the volume header is not found UBI treats this as fatal internal
error and switches to RO mode. If the UBI device was attached via a
full scan the assumption is correct, the volume header has to be
present as it had to be there while scanning to get known as mapped.
If the attach operation happened via Fastmap the assumption is no
longer correct. When attaching via Fastmap UBI learns the mapping
table from Fastmap's snapshot of the system state and not via a full
scan. It can happen that a LEB got unmapped after a Fastmap was
written to the flash. Then UBI can learn the LEB still as mapped and
accessing it returns only 0xFF bytes. As UBI is not a FTL it is
allowed to have mappings to empty PEBs, it assumes that the layer
above takes care of LEB accounting and referencing.
UBIFS does so using the LEB property tree (LPT).
For static volumes UBI blindly assumes that all LEBs are present and
therefore special actions have to be taken.
The described situation can happen when updating a static volume is
interrupted, either by a user or a power cut.
The volume update code first unmaps all LEBs of a volume and then
writes LEB by LEB. If the sequence of operations is interrupted UBI
detects this either by the absence of LEBs, no volume header present
at scan time, or corrupted payload, detected via checksum.
In the Fastmap case the former method won't trigger as no scan
happened and UBI automatically thinks all LEBs are present.
Only by reading data from a LEB it detects that the volume header is
missing and incorrectly treats this as fatal error.
To deal with the situation ubi\_eba\_read\_leb() from now on checks
whether we attached via Fastmap and handles the absence of a
volume header like a data corruption error.
This way interrupted static volume updates will correctly get detected
also when Fastmap is used.

Btrfs: fix handling of faults from btrfs\_copy\_from\_user
commit 56244ef151c3cd11f505020ab0b3f45454363bcc upstream.
When btrfs\_copy\_from\_user isn't able to copy all of the pages, we need
to adjust our accounting to reflect the work that was actually done.
Commit 2e78c927d79 changed around the decisions a little and we ended up
skipping the accounting adjustments some of the time. This commit makes
sure that when we don't copy anything at all, we still hop into
the adjustments, and switches to release\_bytes instead of write\_bytes,
since write\_bytes isn't aligned.
The accounting errors led to warnings during btrfs\_destroy\_inode:

SIGNAL: Move generic copy\_siginfo() to signal.h
commit ca9eb49aa9562eaadf3cea071ec7018ad6800425 upstream.
The generic copy\_siginfo() is currently defined in
asm-generic/siginfo.h, after including uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h which
defines the generic struct siginfo. However this makes it awkward for an
architecture to use it if it has to define its own struct siginfo (e.g.
MIPS and potentially IA64), since it means that asm-generic/siginfo.h
can only be included after defining the arch-specific siginfo, which may
be problematic if the arch-specific definition needs definitions from
uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h.
It is possible to work around this by first including
uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h to get the constants before defining the
arch-specific siginfo, and include asm-generic/siginfo.h after. However
uapi headers can't be included by other uapi headers, so that first
include has to be in an ifdef \_\_kernel\_\_, with the non \_\_kernel\_\_ case
including the non-UAPI header instead.
Instead of that mess, move the generic copy\_siginfo() definition into
linux/signal.h, which allows an arch-specific uapi/asm/siginfo.h to
include asm-generic/siginfo.h and define the arch-specific siginfo, and
for the generic copy\_siginfo() to see that arch-specific definition.

thunderbolt: Fix double free of drom buffer
commit 2ffa9a5d76a75abbc1f95c17959fced666095bdd upstream.
If tb\_drom\_read() fails, sw->drom is freed but not set to NULL. sw->drom
is then freed again in the error path of tb\_switch\_alloc().
The bug can be triggered by unplugging a thunderbolt device shortly after
it is detected by the thunderbolt driver.
Clear sw->drom if tb\_drom\_read() fails.

locking,qspinlock: Fix spin\_is\_locked() and spin\_unlock\_wait()
commit 54cf809b9512be95f53ed4a5e3b631d1ac42f0fa upstream.
Similar to commits:
51d7d5205d33 ("powerpc: Add smp\_mb() to arch\_spin\_is\_locked()")
d86b8da04dfa ("arm64: spinlock: serialise spin\_unlock\_wait against concurrent lockers")
qspinlock suffers from the fact that the \_Q\_LOCKED\_VAL store is
unordered inside the ACQUIRE of the lock.
And while this is not a problem for the regular mutual exclusive
critical section usage of spinlocks, it breaks creative locking like:
spin\_lock(A) spin\_lock(B)
spin\_unlock\_wait(B) if (!spin\_is\_locked(A))
do\_something() do\_something()
In that both CPUs can end up running do\_something at the same time,
because our \_Q\_LOCKED\_VAL store can drop past the spin\_unlock\_wait()
spin\_is\_locked() loads (even on x86!!).
To avoid making the normal case slower, add smp\_mb()s to the less used
spin\_unlock\_wait() / spin\_is\_locked() side of things to avoid this
problem.

OpenSSH expects the (non-blocking) read() of pty master to return
EAGAIN only if it has received all of the slave-side output after
it has received SIGCHLD. This used to work on pre-3.12 kernels.
This fix effectively forces non-blocking read() and poll() to

x86/cpufeature, x86/mm/pkeys: Fix broken compile-time disabling of pkeys
commit e8df1a95b685af84a81698199ee206e0e66a8b44 upstream.
When I added support for the Memory Protection Keys processor
feature, I had to reindent the REQUIRED/DISABLED\_MASK macros, and
also consult the later cpufeature words.
I'm not quite sure how I bungled it, but I consulted the wrong
word at the end. This only affected required or disabled cpu
features in cpufeature words 14, 15 and 16. So, only Protection
Keys itself was screwed over here.
The result was that if you disabled pkeys in your .config, you
might still see some code show up that should have been compiled
out. There should be no functional problems, though.
In verifying this patch I also realized that the DISABLE\_PKU/OSPKE
macros were defined backwards and that the cpu\_has() check in
setup\_pku() was not doing the compile-time disabled checks.
So also fix the macro for DISABLE\_PKU/OSPKE and add a compile-time
check for pkeys being enabled in setup\_pku().

MIPS: KVM: Fix timer IRQ race when writing CP0\_Compare
commit b45bacd2d048f405c7760e5cc9b60dd67708734f upstream.
Writing CP0\_Compare clears the timer interrupt pending bit
(CP0\_Cause.TI), but this wasn't being done atomically. If a timer
interrupt raced with the write of the guest CP0\_Compare, the timer
interrupt could end up being pending even though the new CP0\_Compare is
nowhere near CP0\_Count.
We were already updating the hrtimer expiry with
kvm\_mips\_update\_hrtimer(), which used both kvm\_mips\_freeze\_hrtimer() and
kvm\_mips\_resume\_hrtimer(). Close the race window by expanding out
kvm\_mips\_update\_hrtimer(), and clearing CP0\_Cause.TI and setting
CP0\_Compare between the freeze and resume. Since the pending timer
interrupt should not be cleared when CP0\_Compare is written via the KVM
user API, an ack argument is added to distinguish the source of the
write.

MIPS: KVM: Fix timer IRQ race when freezing timer
commit 4355c44f063d3de4f072d796604c7f4ba4085cc3 upstream.
There's a particularly narrow and subtle race condition when the
software emulated guest timer is frozen which can allow a guest timer
interrupt to be missed.
This happens due to the hrtimer expiry being inexact, so very
occasionally the freeze time will be after the moment when the emulated
CP0\_Count transitions to the same value as CP0\_Compare (so an IRQ should
be generated), but before the moment when the hrtimer is due to expire
(so no IRQ is generated). The IRQ won't be generated when the timer is
resumed either, since the resume CP0\_Count will already match CP0\_Compare.
With VZ guests in particular this is far more likely to happen, since
the soft timer may be frozen frequently in order to restore the timer
state to the hardware guest timer. This happens after 5-10 hours of
guest soak testing, resulting in an overflow in guest kernel timekeeping
calculations, hanging the guest. A more focussed test case to
intentionally hit the race (with the help of a new hypcall to cause the
timer state to migrated between hardware & software) hits the condition
fairly reliably within around 30 seconds.
Instead of relying purely on the inexact hrtimer expiry to determine
whether an IRQ should be generated, read the guest CP0\_Compare and
directly check whether the freeze time is before or after it. Only if
CP0\_Count is on or after CP0\_Compare do we check the hrtimer expiry to
determine whether the last IRQ has already been generated (which will
have pushed back the expiry by one timer period).

KVM: x86: fix ordering of cr0 initialization code in vmx\_cpu\_reset
commit f24632475d4ffed5626abbfab7ef30a128dd1474 upstream.
Commit d28bc9dd25ce reversed the order of two lines which initialize cr0,
allowing the current (old) cr0 value to mess up vcpu initialization.
This was observed in the checks for cr0 X86\_CR0\_WP bit in the context of
kvm\_mmu\_reset\_context(). Besides, setting vcpu->arch.cr0 after vmx\_set\_cr0()
is completely redundant. Change the order back to ensure proper vcpu
initialization.
The combination of booting with ovmf firmware when guest vcpus > 1 and kvm's
ept=N option being set results in a VM-entry failure. This patch fixes that.

KVM: MTRR: remove MSR 0x2f8
commit 9842df62004f366b9fed2423e24df10542ee0dc5 upstream.
MSR 0x2f8 accessed the 124th Variable Range MTRR ever since MTRR support
was introduced by 9ba075a664df ("KVM: MTRR support").
0x2f8 became harmful when 910a6aae4e2e ("KVM: MTRR: exactly define the
size of variable MTRRs") shrinked the array of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8,
which made access to index 124 out of bounds. The surrounding code only
WARNs in this situation, thus the guest gained a limited read/write
access to struct kvm\_arch\_vcpu.
0x2f8 is not a valid VR MTRR MSR, because KVM has/advertises only 16 VR
MTRR MSRs, 0x200-0x20f. Every VR MTRR is set up using two MSRs, 0x2f8
was treated as a PHYSBASE and 0x2f9 would be its PHYSMASK, but 0x2f9 was
not implemented in KVM, therefore 0x2f8 could never do anything useful
and getting rid of it is safe.
This fixes CVE-2016-3713.

usb: host: xhci-rcar: Avoid long wait in xhci\_reset()

The firmware of R-Car USB 3.0 host controller will control the reset.
So, if the xhci driver doesn't do firmware downloading (e.g. kernel
configuration is CONFIG\_USB\_XHCI\_PLATFORM=y and CONFIG\_USB\_XHCI\_RCAR
is not set), the reset of USB 3.0 host controller doesn't work
correctly. Then, the host controller will cause long wait in
xhci\_reset() because the CMD\_RESET bit of op\_regs->command is not
cleared for 10 seconds.
So, this patch modifies the Kconfig to enable both CONFIG\_USB\_XHCI\_PLATFORM
and CONFIG\_USB\_XHCI\_RCAR.

usb: core: hub: hub\_port\_init lock controller instead of bus
commit feb26ac31a2a5cb88d86680d9a94916a6343e9e6 upstream.
The XHCI controller presents two USB buses to the system - one for USB2
and one for USB3. The hub init code (hub\_port\_init) is reentrant but
only locks one bus per thread, leading to a race condition failure when
two threads attempt to simultaneously initialise a USB2 and USB3 device:

[ 13.183701] usb 3-3: device descriptor read/all, error -110
On a test system this failure occurred on 6% of all boots.

hub\_set\_address

xhci\_setup\_device
Mathias Nyman explains the current behaviour violates the XHCI spec:
hub\_port\_reset() will end up moving the corresponding xhci device slot
to default state.
As hub\_port\_reset() is called several times in hub\_port\_init() it
sounds reasonable that we could end up with two threads having their
xhci device slots in default state at the same time, which according to
xhci 4.5.3 specs still is a big no no:
"Note: Software shall not transition more than one Device Slot to the
Default State at a time"
So both threads fail at their next task after this.
One fails to read the descriptor, and the other fails addressing the
device.
Fix this in hub\_port\_init by locking the USB controller (instead of an
individual bus) to prevent simultaneous initialisation of both buses.

USB: leave LPM alone if possible when binding/unbinding interface drivers
commit 6fb650d43da3e7054984dc548eaa88765a94d49f upstream.
When a USB driver is bound to an interface (either through probing or
by claiming it) or is unbound from an interface, the USB core always
disables Link Power Management during the transition and then
re-enables it afterward. The reason is because the driver might want
to prevent hub-initiated link power transitions, in which case the HCD
would have to recalculate the various LPM parameters. This
recalculation takes place when LPM is re-enabled and the new
parameters are sent to the device and its parent hub.
However, if the driver does not want to prevent hub-initiated link
power transitions then none of this work is necessary. The parameters
don't need to be recalculated, and LPM doesn't need to be disabled and
re-enabled.
It turns out that disabling and enabling LPM can be time-consuming,
enough so that it interferes with user programs that want to claim and
release interfaces rapidly via usbfs. Since the usbfs kernel driver
doesn't set the disable\_hub\_initiated\_lpm flag, we can speed things up
and get the user programs to work by leaving LPM alone whenever the
flag isn't set.
And while we're improving the way disable\_hub\_initiated\_lpm gets used,
let's also fix its kerneldoc.

usb: f\_mass\_storage: test whether thread is running before starting another
commit f78bbcae86e676fad9e6c6bb6cd9d9868ba23696 upstream.
When binding the function to usb\_configuration, check whether the thread
is running before starting another one. Without that, when function
instance is added to multiple configurations, fsg\_bing starts multiple
threads with all but the latest one being forgotten by the driver. This
leads to obvious thread leaks, possible lockups when trying to halt the
machine and possible more issues.
This fixes issues with legacy/multi¹ gadget as well as configfs gadgets
when mass\_storage function is added to multiple configurations.
This change also simplifies API since the legacy gadgets no longer need
to worry about starting the thread by themselves (which was where bug
in legacy/multi was in the first place).
N.B., this patch doesn’t address adding single mass\_storage function
instance to a single configuration twice. Thankfully, there’s no
legitimate reason for such setup plus, if I’m not mistaken, configfs
gadget doesn’t even allow it to be expressed.
¹ I have no example failure though. Conclusion that legacy/multi has
a bug is based purely on me reading the code.

usb: gadget: f\_fs: Fix EFAULT generation for async read operations
commit 332a5b446b7916d272c2a659a3b20909ce34d2c1 upstream.
In the current implementation functionfs generates a EFAULT for async read
operations if the read buffer size is larger than the URB data size. Since
a application does not necessarily know how much data the host side is
going to send it typically supplies a buffer larger than the actual data,
which will then result in a EFAULT error.
This behaviour was introduced while refactoring the code to use iov\_iter
interface in commit c993c39b8639 ("gadget/function/f\_fs.c: use put iov\_iter
into io\_data"). The original code took the minimum over the URB size and
the user buffer size and then attempted to copy that many bytes using
copy\_to\_user(). If copy\_to\_user() could not copy all data a EFAULT error
was generated. Restore the original behaviour by only generating a EFAULT
error when the number of bytes copied is not the size of the URB and the
target buffer has not been fully filled.
Commit 342f39a6c8d3 ("usb: gadget: f\_fs: fix check in read operation")
already fixed the same problem for the synchronous read path.

the message is ignored and left dangling in the queue. This may happen
after one of the amthif host connections is closed w/o completing the

To prevent this the driver has to properly discard the message when

Bluetooth: vhci: Fix race at creating hci device
commit c7c999cb18da88a881e10e07f0724ad0bfaff770 upstream.
hci\_vhci driver creates a hci device object dynamically upon each
HCI\_VENDOR\_PKT write. Although it checks the already created object
and returns an error, it's still racy and may build multiple hci\_dev
objects concurrently when parallel writes are performed, as the device
tracks only a single hci\_dev object.
This patch introduces a mutex to protect against the concurrent device
creations.

Bluetooth: vhci: purge unhandled skbs
commit 13407376b255325fa817798800117a839f3aa055 upstream.
The write handler allocates skbs and queues them into data->readq.
Read side should read them, if there is any. If there is none, skbs
should be dropped by hdev->flush. But this happens only if the device
is HCI\_UP, i.e. hdev->power\_on work was triggered already. When it was
not, skbs stay allocated in the queue when /dev/vhci is closed. So
purge the queue in ->release.
Program to reproduce:
#include

int main()
{
char buf[] = { 0xff, 0 };

Bluetooth: vhci: fix open\_timeout vs. hdev race
commit 373a32c848ae3a1c03618517cce85f9211a6facf upstream.
Both vhci\_get\_user and vhci\_release race with open\_timeout work. They
both contain cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync, but do not test whether the
work actually created hdev or not. Since the work can be in progress
and \_sync will wait for finishing it, we can have data->hdev allocated
when cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync returns. But the call sites do 'if
(data->hdev)' \*before\* cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync.
As a result:
\* vhci\_get\_user allocates a second hdev and puts it into
data->hdev. The former is leaked.
\* vhci\_release does not release data->hdev properly as it thinks there
is none.
Fix both cases by moving the actual test \*after\* the call to
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync.
This can be hit by this program:
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main(int argc, char \*\*argv)
{
int fd;
srand(time(NULL));
while (1) {
const int delta = (rand() % 200 - 100) \* 100;
fd = open("/dev/vhci", O\_RDWR);
if (fd < 0)
err(1, "open");
usleep(1000000 + delta);
close(fd);
}
return 0;
}

ACPI / osi: Fix an issue that acpi\_osi=!\* cannot disable ACPICA internal strings
commit 30c9bb0d7603e7b3f4d6a0ea231e1cddae020c32 upstream.
The order of the \_OSI related functionalities is as follows:
acpi\_blacklisted()
acpi\_dmi\_osi\_linux()
acpi\_osi\_setup()
acpi\_osi\_setup()
acpi\_update\_interfaces() if "!\*"
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
parse\_args()
\_\_setup("acpi\_osi=")
acpi\_osi\_setup\_linux()
acpi\_update\_interfaces() if "!\*"
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
acpi\_early\_init()
acpi\_initialize\_subsystem()
acpi\_ut\_initialize\_interfaces()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
acpi\_bus\_init()
acpi\_os\_initialize1()
acpi\_install\_interface\_handler(acpi\_osi\_handler)
acpi\_osi\_setup\_late()
acpi\_update\_interfaces() for "!"
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
acpi\_osi\_handler()
Since acpi\_osi\_setup\_linux() can override acpi\_dmi\_osi\_linux(), the command
line setting can override the DMI detection. That's why acpi\_blacklisted()
is put before \_\_setup("acpi\_osi=").
Then we can notice the following wrong invocation order. There are
acpi\_update\_interfaces() (marked by <<<<) calls invoked before
acpi\_ut\_initialize\_interfaces() (marked by ^^^^). This makes it impossible
to use acpi\_osi=!\* correctly from OSI DMI table or from the command line.
The use of acpi\_osi=!\* is meant to disable both ACPICA
(acpi\_gbl\_supported\_interfaces) and Linux specific strings
(osi\_setup\_entries) while the ACPICA part should have stopped working
because of the order issue.
This patch fixes this issue by moving acpi\_update\_interfaces() to where
it is invoked for acpi\_osi=! (marked by >>>>) as this is ensured to be
invoked after acpi\_ut\_initialize\_interfaces() (marked by ^^^^). Linux
specific strings are still handled in the original place in order to make
the following command line working: acpi\_osi=!\* acpi\_osi="Module Device".
Note that since acpi\_osi=!\* is meant to further disable linux specific
string comparing to the acpi\_osi=!, there is no such use case in our bug
fixing work and hence there is no one using acpi\_osi=!\* either from the
command line or from the DMI quirks, this issue is just a theoretical
issue.

mmc: mmc: Fix partition switch timeout for some eMMCs
commit 1c447116d017a98c90f8f71c8c5a611e0aa42178 upstream.
Some eMMCs set the partition switch timeout too low.
Now typically eMMCs are considered a critical component (e.g. because
they store the root file system) and consequently are expected to be
reliable. Thus we can neglect the use case where eMMCs can't switch
reliably and we might want a lower timeout to facilitate speedy
recovery.
Although we could employ a quirk for the cards that are affected (if
we could identify them all), as described above, there is little
benefit to having a low timeout, so instead simply set a minimum
timeout.
The minimum is set to 300ms somewhat arbitrarily - the examples that
have been seen had a timeout of 10ms but were sometimes taking 60-70ms.

can: fix handling of unmodifiable configuration options
commit bb208f144cf3f59d8f89a09a80efd04389718907 upstream.
As described in 'can: m\_can: tag current CAN FD controllers as non-ISO'
(6cfda7fbebe) it is possible to define fixed configuration options by
setting the according bit in 'ctrlmode' and clear it in 'ctrlmode\_supported'.
This leads to the incovenience that the fixed configuration bits can not be
passed by netlink even when they have the correct values (e.g. non-ISO, FD).
This patch fixes that issue and not only allows fixed set bit values to be set
again but now requires(!) to provide these fixed values at configuration time.
A valid CAN FD configuration consists of a nominal/arbitration bittiming, a
data bittiming and a control mode with CAN\_CTRLMODE\_FD set - which is now
enforced by a new can\_validate() function. This fix additionally removed the
inconsistency that was prohibiting the support of 'CANFD-only' controller
drivers, like the RCar CAN FD.
For this reason a new helper can\_set\_static\_ctrlmode() has been introduced to
provide a proper interface to handle static enabled CAN controller options.

The GICv3 driver wrongly assumes that it runs on the non-secure

with a single security state, or a GICv3 with GICD\_CTLR.DS set.
Either way, it is important to configure this properly, or

irqchip/gic: Ensure ordering between read of INTACK and shared data
commit f86c4fbd930ff6fecf3d8a1c313182bd0f49f496 upstream.
When an IPI is generated by a CPU, the pattern looks roughly like:
smp\_wmb();
On the receiving CPU we rely on the fact that, once we've taken the
interrupt, then the freshly written shared data must be visible to us.
Put another way, the CPU isn't going to speculate taking an interrupt.
Unfortunately, this assumption turns out to be broken.
Consider that CPUx wants to send an IPI to CPUy, which will cause CPUy
to read some shared\_data. Before CPUx has done anything, a random
peripheral raises an IRQ to the GIC and the IRQ line on CPUy is raised.
CPUy then takes the IRQ and starts executing the entry code, heading
towards gic\_handle\_irq. Furthermore, let's assume that a bunch of the
previous interrupts handled by CPUy were SGIs, so the branch predictor
kicks in and speculates that irqnr will be <16 and we're likely to
head into handle\_IPI. The prefetcher then grabs a speculative copy of
shared\_data which contains a stale value.
Meanwhile, CPUx gets round to updating shared\_data and asking the GIC
to send an SGI to CPUy. Internally, the GIC decides that the SGI is
more important than the peripheral interrupt (which hasn't yet been
ACKed) but doesn't need to do anything to CPUy, because the IRQ line
is already raised.
CPUy then reads the ACK register on the GIC, sees the SGI value which
confirms the branch prediction and we end up with a stale shared\_data
value.
This patch fixes the problem by adding an smp\_rmb() to the IPI entry
code in gic\_handle\_irq. As it turns out, the combination of a control
dependency and an ISB instruction from the EOI in the GICv3 driver is
enough to provide the ordering we need, so we add a comment there
justifying the absence of an explicit smp\_rmb().

imx\_pwm\_config\_v2 sleeps.
Tested on Freescale i.MX53 SoC with 4.6.0.

sched/loadavg: Fix loadavg artifacts on fully idle and on fully loaded systems
commit 20878232c52329f92423d27a60e48b6a6389e0dd upstream.
Systems show a minimal load average of 0.00, 0.01, 0.05 even when they
have no load at all.
Uptime and /proc/loadavg on all systems with kernels released during the
last five years up until kernel version 4.6-rc5, show a 5- and 15-minute
minimum loadavg of 0.01 and 0.05 respectively. This should be 0.00 on
idle systems, but the way the kernel calculates this value prevents it
from getting lower than the mentioned values.
Likewise but not as obviously noticeable, a fully loaded system with no
processes waiting, shows a maximum 1/5/15 loadavg of 1.00, 0.99, 0.95
(multiplied by number of cores).
Once the (old) load becomes 93 or higher, it mathematically can never
get lower than 93, even when the active (load) remains 0 forever.
This results in the strange 0.00, 0.01, 0.05 uptime values on idle
systems. Note: 93/2048 = 0.0454..., which rounds up to 0.05.
It is not correct to add a 0.5 rounding (=1024/2048) here, since the
result from this function is fed back into the next iteration again,
so the result of that +0.5 rounding value then gets multiplied by
(2048-2037), and then rounded again, so there is a virtual "ghost"
load created, next to the old and active load terms.
By changing the way the internally kept value is rounded, that internal
value equivalent now can reach 0.00 on idle, and 1.00 on full load. Upon
increasing load, the internally kept load value is rounded up, when the
load is decreasing, the load value is rounded down.
The modified code was tested on nohz=off and nohz kernels. It was tested
on vanilla kernel 4.6-rc5 and on centos 7.1 kernel 3.10.0-327. It was
tested on single, dual, and octal cores system. It was tested on virtual
hosts and bare hardware. No unwanted effects have been observed, and the
problems that the patch intended to fix were indeed gone.

fscrypto/f2fs: allow fs-specific key prefix for fs encryption
commit b5a7aef1ef436ec005fef0efe31a676ec5f4ab31 upstream.
This patch allows fscrypto to handle a second key prefix given by filesystem.
The main reason is to provide backward compatibility, since previously f2fs
used "f2fs:" as a crypto prefix instead of "fscrypt:".
Later, ext4 should also provide key\_prefix() to give "ext4:".
One concern decribed by Ted would be kinda double check overhead of prefixes.
In x86, for example, validate\_user\_key consumes 8 ms after boot-up, which turns
out derive\_key\_aes() consumed most of the time to load specific crypto module.
After such the cold miss, it shows almost zero latencies, which treats as a
negligible overhead.
Note that request\_key() detects wrong prefix in prior to derive\_key\_aes() even.

crypto: sha1-mb - make sha1\_x8\_avx2() conform to C function ABI
commit 4a6b27b79da5ccc6b85dc05bbe6a091e58be896a upstream.
Megha Dey reported a kernel panic in crypto code. The problem is that
sha1\_x8\_avx2() clobbers registers r12-r15 without saving and restoring
them.
Before commit aec4d0e301f1 ("x86/asm/crypto: Simplify stack usage in
sha-mb functions"), those registers were saved and restored by the
callers of the function. I removed them with that commit because I
didn't realize sha1\_x8\_avx2() clobbered them.
Fix the potential undefined behavior associated with clobbering the
registers and make the behavior less surprising by changing the
registers to be callee saved/restored to conform with the C function
call ABI.
Also, rdx (aka RSP\_SAVE) doesn't need to be saved: I verified that none
of the callers rely on it being saved, and it's not a callee-saved
register in the C ABI.

commit e930c765ca5c6b039cd22ebfb4504ea7b5dab43d upstream.
caam\_jr\_alloc() used to return NULL if a JR device could not be
allocated for a session. In turn, every user of this function used
IS\_ERR() function to verify if anything went wrong, which does NOT look
for NULL values. This made the kernel crash if the sanity check failed,
because the driver continued to think it had allocated a valid JR dev
instance to the session and at some point it tries to do a caam\_jr\_free()
on a NULL JR dev pointer.

ring-buffer: Prevent overflow of size in ring\_buffer\_resize()
commit 59643d1535eb220668692a5359de22545af579f6 upstream.
If the size passed to ring\_buffer\_resize() is greater than MAX\_LONG - BUF\_PAGE\_SIZE
then the DIV\_ROUND\_UP() will return zero.
Here's the details:
# echo 18014398509481980 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer\_size\_kb
tracing\_entries\_write() processes this and converts kb to bytes.
18014398509481980 << 10 = 18446744073709547520
and this is passed to ring\_buffer\_resize() as unsigned long size.
size = DIV\_ROUND\_UP(size, BUF\_PAGE\_SIZE);
Where DIV\_ROUND\_UP(a, b) is (a + b - 1)/b
BUF\_PAGE\_SIZE is 4080 and here
18446744073709547520 + 4080 - 1 = 18446744073709551599
where 18446744073709551599 is still smaller than 2^64
2^64 - 18446744073709551599 = 17
But now 18446744073709551599 / 4080 = 4521260802379792
and size = size \* 4080 = 18446744073709551360
This is checked to make sure its still greater than 2 \* 4080,
which it is.
Then we convert to the number of buffer pages needed.
nr\_page = DIV\_ROUND\_UP(size, BUF\_PAGE\_SIZE)
but this time size is 18446744073709551360 and
2^64 - (18446744073709551360 + 4080 - 1) = -3823
Thus it overflows and the resulting number is less than 4080, which makes
3823 / 4080 = 0
an nr\_pages is set to this. As we already checked against the minimum that
nr\_pages may be, this causes the logic to fail as well, and we crash the
kernel.
There's no reason to have the two DIV\_ROUND\_UP() (that's just result of
historical code changes), clean up the code and fix this bug.

ring-buffer: Use long for nr\_pages to avoid overflow failures
commit 9b94a8fba501f38368aef6ac1b30e7335252a220 upstream.
The size variable to change the ring buffer in ftrace is a long. The
nr\_pages used to update the ring buffer based on the size is int. On 64 bit
machines this can cause an overflow problem.
For example, the following will cause the ring buffer to crash:
# cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
# echo 10 > buffer\_size\_kb
# echo 8556384240 > buffer\_size\_kb
Then you get the warning of:
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 318 at kernel/trace/ring\_buffer.c:1527 rb\_update\_pages+0x22f/0x260
Which is:
RB\_WARN\_ON(cpu\_buffer, nr\_removed);
Note each ring buffer page holds 4080 bytes.
This is because:
1) 10 causes the ring buffer to have 3 pages.
(10kb requires 3 \* 4080 pages to hold)
2) (2^31 / 2^10 + 1) \* 4080 = 8556384240
The value written into buffer\_size\_kb is shifted by 10 and then passed
to ring\_buffer\_resize(). 8556384240 \* 2^10 = 8761737461760
3) The size passed to ring\_buffer\_resize() is then divided by BUF\_PAGE\_SIZE
which is 4080. 8761737461760 / 4080 = 2147484672
4) nr\_pages is subtracted from the current nr\_pages (3) and we get:
2147484669. This value is saved in a signed integer nr\_pages\_to\_update
5) 2147484669 is greater than 2^31 but smaller than 2^32, a signed int
turns into the value of -2147482627
6) As the value is a negative number, in update\_pages\_handler() it is
negated and passed to rb\_remove\_pages() and 2147482627 pages will
be removed, which is much larger than 3 and it causes the warning
because not all the pages asked to be removed were removed.

asix: Fix offset calculation in asix\_rx\_fixup() causing slow transmissions
commit cd9e2e5d3ff148be9ea210f622ce3e8e8292fcd6 upstream.
In testing with HiKey, we found that since
commit 3f30b158eba5 ("asix: On RX avoid creating bad Ethernet
frames"),
we're seeing lots of noise during network transfers:
[ 239.027993] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Data Header synchronisation was lost, remaining 988
[ 239.037310] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Bad Header Length 0x54ebb5ec, offset 4
[ 239.045519] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Bad Header Length 0xcdffe7a2, offset 4
[ 239.275044] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Data Header synchronisation was lost, remaining 988
[ 239.284355] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Bad Header Length 0x1d36f59d, offset 4
[ 239.292541] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Bad Header Length 0xaef3c1e9, offset 4
[ 239.518996] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Data Header synchronisation was lost, remaining 988
[ 239.528300] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Bad Header Length 0x2881912, offset 4
[ 239.536413] asix 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: asix\_rx\_fixup() Bad Header Length 0x5638f7e2, offset 4
And network throughput ends up being pretty bursty and slow with
a overall throughput of at best ~30kB/s (where as previously we
got 1.1MB/s with the slower USB1.1 "full speed" host).
We found the issue also was reproducible on a x86\_64 system,
using a "high-speed" USB2.0 port but the throughput did not
measurably drop (possibly due to the scp transfer being cpu
bound on my slow test hardware).
After lots of debugging, I found the check added in the
problematic commit seems to be calculating the offset
incorrectly.
In the normal case, in the main loop of the function, we do:
(where offset is zero, or set to "offset += (copy\_length + 1) &
0xfffe" in the previous loop)
rx->header = get\_unaligned\_le32(skb->data +
offset);
offset += sizeof(u32);
But the problematic patch calculates:
offset = ((rx->remaining + 1) & 0xfffe) + sizeof(u32);
rx->header = get\_unaligned\_le32(skb->data + offset);
Adding some debug logic to check those offset calculation used
to find rx->header, the one in problematic code is always too
large by sizeof(u32).
Thus, this patch removes the incorrect " + sizeof(u32)" addition
in the problematic calculation, and resolves the issue.

remove directory incorrectly tries to set delete on close on non-empty directories
commit 897fba1172d637d344f009d700f7eb8a1fa262f1 upstream.
Wrong return code was being returned on SMB3 rmdir of
non-empty directory.
For SMB3 (unlike for cifs), we attempt to delete a directory by
set of delete on close flag on the open. Windows clients set
this flag via a set info (SET\_FILE\_DISPOSITION to set this flag)
which properly checks if the directory is empty.
With this patch on smb3 mounts we correctly return
"DIRECTORY NOT EMPTY"
on attempts to remove a non-empty directory.

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Remove WARN\_ON\_ONCE in uncore\_pci\_probe

When booting with nr\_cpus=1, uncore\_pci\_probe tries to init the PCI/uncore
also for the other packages and fails with warning when they are not found.
The warning is bogus because it's correct to fail here for packages which are
not initialized. Remove it and return silently.

arm/arm64: KVM: Enforce Break-Before-Make on Stage-2 page tables
commit d4b9e0790aa764c0b01e18d4e8d33e93ba36d51f upstream.
The ARM architecture mandates that when changing a page table entry
from a valid entry to another valid entry, an invalid entry is first
written, TLB invalidated, and only then the new entry being written.
The current code doesn't respect this, directly writing the new
entry and only then invalidating TLBs. Let's fix it up.

arm64: cpuinfo: Missing NULL terminator in compat\_hwcap\_str
commit f228b494e56d949be8d8ea09d4f973d1979201bf upstream.
The loop that browses the array compat\_hwcap\_str will stop when a NULL
is encountered, however NULL is missing at the end of array. This will
lead to overrun until a NULL is found somewhere in the following memory.
In reality, this works out because the compat\_hwcap2\_str array tends to
follow immediately in memory, and that \*is\* terminated correctly.
Furthermore, the unsigned int compat\_elf\_hwcap is checked before
printing each capability, so we end up doing the right thing because
the size of the two arrays is less than 32. Still, this is an obvious
mistake and should be fixed.
Note for backporting: commit 12d11817eaafa414 ("arm64: Move
/proc/cpuinfo handling code") moved this code in v4.4. Prior to that
commit, the same change should be made in arch/arm64/kernel/setup.c.

arm64: Implement pmdp\_set\_access\_flags() for hardware AF/DBM
commit 282aa7051b0169991b34716f0f22d9c2f59c46c4 upstream.
The update to the accessed or dirty states for block mappings must be
done atomically on hardware with support for automatic AF/DBM. The
ptep\_set\_access\_flags() function has been fixed as part of commit
66dbd6e61a52 ("arm64: Implement ptep\_set\_access\_flags() for hardware
AF/DBM"). This patch brings pmdp\_set\_access\_flags() in line with the pte
counterpart.

arm64: Implement ptep\_set\_access\_flags() for hardware AF/DBM
commit 66dbd6e61a526ae7d11a208238ae2c17e5cacb6b upstream.
When hardware updates of the access and dirty states are enabled, the
default ptep\_set\_access\_flags() implementation based on calling
set\_pte\_at() directly is potentially racy. This triggers the "racy dirty
state clearing" warning in set\_pte\_at() because an existing writable PTE
is overridden with a clean entry.
There are two main scenarios for this situation:
1. The CPU getting an access fault does not support hardware updates of
the access/dirty flags. However, a different agent in the system
(e.g. SMMU) can do this, therefore overriding a writable entry with a
clean one could potentially lose the automatically updated dirty
status
2. A more complex situation is possible when all CPUs support hardware
AF/DBM:
a) Initial state: shareable + writable vma and pte\_none(pte)
b) Read fault taken by two threads of the same process on different
CPUs
c) CPU0 takes the mmap\_sem and proceeds to handling the fault. It
eventually reaches do\_set\_pte() which sets a writable + clean pte.
CPU0 releases the mmap\_sem
d) CPU1 acquires the mmap\_sem and proceeds to handle\_pte\_fault(). The
pte entry it reads is present, writable and clean and it continues
to pte\_mkyoung()
e) CPU1 calls ptep\_set\_access\_flags()
If between (d) and (e) the hardware (another CPU) updates the dirty
state (clears PTE\_RDONLY), CPU1 will override the PTR\_RDONLY bit
marking the entry clean again.
This patch implements an arm64-specific ptep\_set\_access\_flags() function
to perform an atomic update of the PTE flags.

arm64: Ensure pmd\_present() returns false after pmd\_mknotpresent()
commit 5bb1cc0ff9a6b68871970737e6c4c16919928d8b upstream.
Currently, pmd\_present() only checks for a non-zero value, returning
true even after pmd\_mknotpresent() (which only clears the type bits).
This patch converts pmd\_present() to using pte\_present(), similar to the
other pmd\_\*() checks. As a side effect, it will return true for
PROT\_NONE mappings, though they are not yet used by the kernel with
transparent huge pages.
For consistency, also change pmd\_mknotpresent() to only clear the
PMD\_SECT\_VALID bit, even though the PMD\_TABLE\_BIT is already 0 for block
mappings (no functional change). The unused PMD\_SECT\_PROT\_NONE
definition is removed as transparent huge pages use the pte page prot
values.

commit 911f56eeb87ee378f5e215469268a7a2f68a5a8a upstream.
With hardware AF/DBM support, pmd modifications (transparent huge pages)
should be performed atomically using load/store exclusive. The initial
patches defined the get-and-clear function and \_\_HAVE\_ARCH\_\* macro
without the "huge" word, leaving the pmdp\_huge\_get\_and\_clear() to the
default, non-atomic implementation.

```
MSR 0x2f8 accessed the 124th Variable Range MTRR ever since MTRR support
was introduced by [9ba075a](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/9ba075a664dff836fd6fb93f90fcc827f7683d91) ("KVM: MTRR support").

0x2f8 became harmful when [910a6aa](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/910a6aae4e2e45855efc4a268e43eed2d8445575) ("KVM: MTRR: exactly define the
size of variable MTRRs") shrinked the array of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8,
which made access to index 124 out of bounds.  The surrounding code only
WARNs in this situation, thus the guest gained a limited read/write
access to struct kvm_arch_vcpu.

0x2f8 is not a valid VR MTRR MSR, because KVM has/advertises only 16 VR
MTRR MSRs, 0x200-0x20f.  Every VR MTRR is set up using two MSRs, 0x2f8
was treated as a PHYSBASE and 0x2f9 would be its PHYSMASK, but 0x2f9 was
not implemented in KVM, therefore 0x2f8 could never do anything useful
and getting rid of it is safe.

This fixes [CVE-2016-3713](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rq49-9828-pwwr "CVE-2016-3713").
