CVE-2016-3713:
 - **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read/write access
 - **Root cause:** The KVM implementation incorrectly validated the MSR (Model Specific Register) 0x2f8, allowing access to the 124th Variable Range MTRR (Memory Type Range Register).  A previous commit "KVM: MTRR: exactly define the size of variable MTRRs" reduced the number of VR MTRRs from 256 to 8. This made the access to the 124th index go out of bounds.
 - **Attack vector:** A privileged user inside the guest OS could access processor's MTRRs via ioctl(2) calls.
 - **Impact:** The vulnerability allowed a guest OS user to read/write to the kvm\_arch\_vcpu data structure in the host kernel, leading to information disclosure or a denial of service (system crash).
 - **Fix:** Removed the validation for MSR 0x2f8 in the `msr_mtrr_valid` function.
