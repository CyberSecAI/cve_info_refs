Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3760:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content relates to CVE-2016-3760. The CVE description mentions a Bluetooth elevation of privilege vulnerability that allows adding an authenticated Bluetooth device that persists for the primary user, and the provided commit messages explicitly discuss adding "guest mode functionality" to Bluetooth, where devices paired in restricted mode are deleted upon exiting the restricted mode. This maps to the description provided in the bulletin of CVE-2016-3760.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Bluetooth pairing is handled in "restricted mode" or "guest mode". The code introduces a flaw that allows a paired device during a guest session to persist for the primary user even after the guest session ends, even though it should have been deleted according to the intended design of the restricted mode.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Access Control:** The intended behavior was to delete all Bluetooth pairings made during a restricted/guest mode session upon exiting this mode. However, the vulnerability arises because the deletion of paired devices is not correctly enforced when switching back from a restricted/guest user to the primary user.
    *   **Data Persistence Issue:** Bluetooth pairings from a guest mode user should not be persisted to the primary user. The code vulnerability causes data persistence contrary to its design goal, thereby breaking the isolation intended for guest mode.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Elevation of Privilege:** A local attacker, potentially through a malicious application or through a compromised guest account, can add a Bluetooth device that will persist on the primary user's profile, allowing the attacker to maintain access to the user's device even after the guest mode or malicious app is no longer active or the guest session ends. This can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity.
    *   **Bypass of User Permission:** The vulnerability enables a method of pairing Bluetooth devices without the explicit permission of the primary user.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the device, either through a malicious app running on the device or through a temporary "guest" session on the device.
    *   **Bluetooth Pairing:** The attacker must be able to pair a device through the Bluetooth functionality during a guest mode session.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device or be able to run a malicious app on the device.
    *   **Guest/Restricted Mode:** The attacker needs the ability to use the guest or restricted mode.
    *   **Bluetooth Pairing Capability:** The attacker must be able to connect a Bluetooth device to the phone while the guest or restricted mode is active.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided commit messages show the code changes are related to adding "guest mode functionality" and a flag to enable Bluetooth in restricted mode, which explicitly ties to the vulnerability description. The commits describe deleting devices paired during restricted mode upon leaving it, but the vulnerability exploits a flaw in this mechanism
*   The fix involves addressing the incorrect persistence behavior of paired Bluetooth devices from restricted mode to the primary user.
