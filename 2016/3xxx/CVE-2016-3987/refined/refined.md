{
  "CVE-2016-3987": {
    "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Trend Micro Password Manager component, written in JavaScript with node.js, opens multiple HTTP RPC ports for handling API requests. One of these API endpoints, `openUrlInDefaultBrowser`, maps to `ShellExecute()`, allowing arbitrary command execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure API endpoint",
      "Arbitrary command execution",
      "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A website can make an HTTP request to the vulnerable API endpoint on the localhost (e.g., `https://localhost:49155/api/openUrlInDefaultBrowser`).",
       "Malicious web pages or compromised websites can be used to exploit the vulnerability via JavaScript."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting a malicious webpage that executes a crafted JavaScript to send a request to the local HTTP RPC server. The attacker does not need to be on the local network.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerable application is the Trend Micro Password Manager, which is installed by default when installing Trend Micro Antivirus on Windows. The exploit code iterates through several ports (49155 to 49160) in case the service is not listening on the default port."
