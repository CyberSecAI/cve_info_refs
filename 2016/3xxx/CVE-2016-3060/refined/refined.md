- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a failure in IBM Payments Director that allows a remote attacker to hijack the clicking action of a victim.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clickjacking vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack could lead to the hijacking of the victim's click actions and potentially enable further attacks against the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can persuade a victim to visit a malicious web site which can then be used to hijack click actions.
