Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2016-3227:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a "use-after-free" issue in the Windows DNS Server. This means that the server attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of requests by the Windows DNS server. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because of how the DNS server manages memory when processing requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the affected system. The attacker's code will execute in the context of the Local System Account, which has high privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted, malicious requests to a Windows DNS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable DNS server. This could be over a local network, or potentially over the internet if the server is publicly accessible.
- No prior authentication or specific user rights are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for affected versions of Windows Server.
- The provided content specifies that the update addresses the issue by modifying how Windows DNS servers handle requests.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds have been identified.
