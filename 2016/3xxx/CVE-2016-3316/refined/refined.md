Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-3316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Office parses an invalid operand in "sprmSdyaTop" within a SEPX structure. This improper parsing leads to a memory corruption issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory during the parsing process. Specifically, it is related to the `sprmSdyaTop` operand within a SEPX structure.
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability can allow an attacker to read outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system, enabling them to install software, manipulate data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not the primary impact described, the exploit-db entry notes a denial-of-service aspect, though details are not specified.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted Microsoft Office file (e.g., a Word document).
- **Email Attack Scenario:**  An attacker can send a malicious file via email and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-Based Attack Scenario:** An attacker could host a website or leverage a compromised website hosting the malicious file, and then convince users to open the file.
- **Preview Pane:** According to Microsoft's advisory, when the severity is listed as "Critical" as it is for some versions of word, the preview pane is an attack vector for this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Microsoft Office file containing the specific exploit.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious file.
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system before exploitation. The code execution occurs with the privileges of the user who opens the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Microsoft Office including Word 2013 and 2016 (and Word 2011 for Mac), as well as Word Viewer.
- Microsoft has released a security update (MS16-099) to address the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.
- There are no known mitigating factors or workarounds other than applying the patch.
