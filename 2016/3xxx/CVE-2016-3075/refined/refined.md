    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the nss_dns implementation of the getnetbyname function in GNU C Library (aka glibc) before 2.24 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a long name.",

      "glibc",
      "nss_dns"
    ],
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `_nss_dns_getnetbyname_r` function due to improper handling of long network names. The function uses `strdupa` which is an alloca-based string duplication, without validating the length, leading to an unbounded allocation and stack overflow.",

   "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow in the glob implementation occurs because it does not properly validate the length of a directory name when the `GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC` option is used. Specifically, the code uses `NAME_MAX` to determine an array size, but a specially crafted directory can contain file names that exceed this size, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.",
