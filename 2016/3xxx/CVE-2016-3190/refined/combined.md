```
A new cairo release 1.14.2 is now available from:

  <http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.14.2.tar.xz>

    which can be verified with:

    <http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.14.2.tar.xz.sha1>
    c8da68aa66ca0855b5d0ff552766d3e8679e1d24  cairo-1.14.2.tar.xz

    <http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.14.2.tar.xz.sha1.asc>
    (signed by Bryce Harrington)

  Additionally, a git clone of the source tree:

  git clone git://git.cairographics.org/git/cairo

    will include a signed 1.14.2 tag which points to a commit named:
    93422b3cb5e0ef8104b8194c8873124ce2f5ea2d

    which can be verified with:
    git verify-tag 1.14.2

    and can be checked out with a command such as:
    git checkout -b build 1.14.2

Release 1.14.2 (2014-03-09 Bryce Harrington <bryce osg samsung com>)
====================================================================
This release provides collected bug fixes, along with one feature
enhancement for the xcb backend, and a small performance improvement for
fonts.

The running theme of the bug fixes is platform-specific issues, both
build and run-time.  Platforms with fixes include Sparc, AIX, Windows
(mingw), and Windows (MSVC8).  Memory leaks, valgrind issues, and PDF
issues round out our list.

It's come to light that changes in cairo 1.14 resulted in breakage on
MacOS X 10.4.  We've not yet determined whether to fix up the support,
or excise the 10.4-specific code and support only OS X 10.5 or newer.
Meantime, we'll only advertise cairo as working on OS X 10.5.

Features
--------
 * Improve xcb's handling of per-screen subpixel ordering.  If no
   Xft.rgba property is specified, default to the screen's subpixel
   order.

API Changes
-----------
None

Dependency Changes
------------------
None

Performance Optimizations
-------------------------
 * Improve performance of cpu_to_be32 and be32_to_cpu, making truetype
   subsetting of large fonts run about 15% faster.

Bug Fixes
---------
 * Fix unaligned access on sparc with the compact font format (CFF).
   Unlike truetype, all data in CFF is not aligned.
   (Debian bug #712836)
 * Fix unaligned access on sparc with tor-scan-converter's memory pool.
 * Fix crash when loading a PDF with a transformed image.
   (fdo bug #85151)
 * Fix regression on mingw for bigendian test due to removal of file
   extension for executables.
   (fdo bug #85120)
 * Fix handling of backslash in PDF interpreter
   (fdo bug #85662)
 * Fix crash in xlib and xcb renderers when swapping a 0-sized glyph
 * Fix bug with RTL text in PDF operators
   (fdo bug #86461)
 * Fix compilation 'cairo-path-stroke-traps.c' with MSVC8
   (fdo bug #84908)
 * Fix crash in _fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans when a span length is
   negative.
 * Fix valgrind error by releasing pattern created by
   cairo_pattern_create_rgb().
 * Fix valgrind errors when running cairo-test-suite.
 * Fix memory leak in recording surface replays
   (fdo bug #87898)
 * Fix destruction of fonts in api-special-cases test.
   (fdo bug #87567)
 * Fix duplicated surface push on similar-image, preventing trivial GTK3
   program traces from being replayable, with an error message about
   invalid values for the size of the input.
   (fdo bug #73580)
 * Fix crash when win32 surface's image size does not cover the entire
   surface.
   (fdo bug #53121)
 * Fix crash due to obsolete CGFontGetGlyphPath call
   (fdo bug #84324)
 * Fix several build issues on AIX
   (fdo bugs #89338, #89340, #89356, #89354)
 * Fix various documentation warnings and errors

What is cairo
=============
Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
System (via both Xlib and XCB), quartz, win32, and image buffers,
as well as PDF, PostScript, and SVG file output. Experimental backends
include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available
(for example, through the X Render Extension).

The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo include stroking and filling
cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images,
and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be
transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear,
etc.).

Cairo has been designed to let you draw anything you want in a modern
2D graphical user interface.  At the same time, the cairo API has been
designed to be as fun and easy to learn as possible. If you're not
having fun while programming with cairo, then we have failed
somewhere---let us know and we'll try to fix it next time around.

Cairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or
modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version
1.1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1318977#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-18 10:10:32 UTC  ```  A vulnerability was found in cairo. A maliciously crafted file can cause out of bounds read in fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans function in cairo, thus crashing the software.  Upstream fix:  <https://cgit.freedesktop.org/cairo/patch/src/cairo-image-compositor.c?id=5c82d91a5e15d29b1489dcb413b24ee7fdf59934>  References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/675>  External references:  <https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2015-March/msg00047.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1318977#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-18 10:11:00 UTC  ```  Created mingw-cairo tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1318978](show_bug.cgi?id=1318978 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-3190 mingw-cairo: cairo: out of bounds read in fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1318977#c3)  Doran Moppert    2016-06-06 03:02:06 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89521>  Reproducer is available there.  Note last update in [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1318977#c2):  > However, the original author of that patch (ilia.softway) has > expressed doubts that this change fully fixes the problem and he is now using > an additional patch to cell_list_add_subspan() in cairo-tor_scan-converter.c. > > Therefore, I think it is best to leave this bug open until the root cause is > fully understood.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1318977#c5)  Doran Moppert    2016-07-19 07:39:39 UTC  ``` The window of affected versions is somewhere after 1.11.2 until the fix was included in 1.14.2.  This leaves epel-7/mingw-cairo and rhel-7.1/cairo affected;  all other versions are either prior to the vulnerable code's introduction or (rhel-7.2, fedora, epel/cairo) include the fix.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1318977#c8)  Doran Moppert    2016-09-23 04:34:55 UTC  ``` This CVE was previously addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 in the rebase to 1.14.2:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2015-2116.html>   ``` |  |
