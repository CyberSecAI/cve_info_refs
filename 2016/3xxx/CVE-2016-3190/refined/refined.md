{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a negative span length in the `fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read due to incorrect handling of negative span length in the `fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans` function, leading to a crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a maliciously crafted file or input that causes a negative span length in the `fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans` function. It can be triggered remotely via a network, but the complexity is described as medium in one analysis, possibly meaning local input is also possible.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide input that causes a negative span length to be processed in the vulnerable function. This can be done by crafting a malicious file. No authentication is required for the attack."
