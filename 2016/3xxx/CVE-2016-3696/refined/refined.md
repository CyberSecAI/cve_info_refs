    "CVE-2016-3696": {
        "description": "The `pulp-qpid-ssl-cfg` script in Pulp creates certificate files and NSS database files in a world-readable temporary directory, then copies the content to the permanent installation directory with incorrect permissions. Permissions are corrected only after the copying is complete, creating a time frame for an attacker to potentially steal sensitive data.",
        "root_cause": "The `pulp-qpid-ssl-cfg` script creates certificate files and NSS database files in a world-readable temporary directory, and copies it to permanent location.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Insecure temporary file creation",
             "Incorrect file permissions"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data like private keys if they can access the temporary directory during the vulnerable timeframe.",

            "Local access to the server",
             "Access to the temporary directory while the script is running"
