Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `fpAcc` function within `tif_predict.c` of the libtiff library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Division by Zero:** The code calculates `wc` by dividing `cc` by `bps`. If `bps` is zero, this results in a division-by-zero error.
*   The value of `bps` is derived from `tif->tif_dir.td_bitspersample / 8`, and if `td_bitspersample` is 0, then `bps` becomes zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The division-by-zero error leads to a crash of the application, causing a denial of service. This is demonstrated by the `SIGFPE` signal and backtrace from the gdb output in the first provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted TIFF Image:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted TIFF image is processed. The attacker can create a malformed image where the `td_bitspersample` tag is set to 0, causing `bps` to be 0.
*   The specific tool that triggers this is `tiff2rgba`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF image to a user or application that uses libtiff and triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided debug output from `gdb` clearly shows the division by zero occurring on line 381 of `tif_predict.c`, with `bps` being 0.
*   The vulnerability affects libtiff versions 4.0.6 and earlier.
*   The issue is fixed in later versions as indicated by the Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3762-1) where the fix was implemented in version 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u2 for the stable distribution (jessie)

The Gentoo Security Advisory also lists CVE-2016-3622 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed by upgrading to libtiff 4.0.7, along with numerous other CVEs.
