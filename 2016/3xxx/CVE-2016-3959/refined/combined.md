Subject: CVE request - Go - DLL loading, Big int

OSS-Security,

The Go open source project has identified two security issues that we
believe warrant the issuing of a new release:

1. On Windows, Go loads system DLLs by name with LoadLibrary, making it
vulnerable to DLL preloading attacks. Notably, if a user launched a Go
executable from their Downloads folder and malicious DLLs were in their
Downloads folder. This is being address in the following CL:
<https://golang.org/cl/21428>

2. Go has an infinite loop in several big integer routines that makes Go
programs vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks.  Programs using
HTTPS client authentication or the Go ssh server libraries are both exposed
to this vulnerability. This is being addressed in the following CL:
<https://golang.org/cl/21533>

We will release two new versions - Go 1.6.1 and 1.5.4 - both of which will
address these two issues.

Regards,
Jason Buberel
PM, Go

Security Advisory: Moderate

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1538)

## Topic

An update for golang is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The golang packages provide the Go programming language compiler.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: golang (1.6.3). (BZ#1346331)

Security Fix(es):

* An input-validation flaw was discovered in the Go programming language built in CGI implementation, which set the environment variable "HTTP\_PROXY" using the incoming "Proxy" HTTP-request header. The environment variable "HTTP\_PROXY" is used by numerous web clients, including Go's net/http package, to specify a proxy server to use for HTTP and, in some cases, HTTPS requests. This meant that when a CGI-based web application ran, an attacker could specify a proxy server which the application then used for subsequent outgoing requests, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. (CVE-2016-5386)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.

Subject: Re: CVE request - Go - DLL loading, Big int

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> 1. On Windows, Go loads system DLLs by name with LoadLibrary, making it
> vulnerable to DLL preloading attacks. Notably, if a user launched a Go
> executable from their Downloads folder and malicious DLLs were in their
> Downloads folder. This is being address in the following CL:
> <https://golang.org/cl/21428>

Use CVE-2016-3958.

> 2. Go has an infinite loop in several big integer routines that makes Go
> programs vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks.  Programs using
> HTTPS client authentication or the Go ssh server libraries are both exposed
> to this vulnerability. This is being addressed in the following CL:
> <https://golang.org/cl/21533>

Use CVE-2016-3959.

# CVE-2016-3959

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-3956.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-3960.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-3959 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3959)

#### Description

The Verify function in crypto/dsa/dsa.go in Go before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x before 1.6.1 does not properly check parameters passed to the big integer library, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted public key to a program that uses HTTPS client certificates or SSH server libraries.
