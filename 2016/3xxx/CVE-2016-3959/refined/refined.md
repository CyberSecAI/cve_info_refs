  "CVE-2016-3959": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2016-3959",
      "Description": "The Verify function in crypto/dsa/dsa.go in Go before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x before 1.6.1 does not properly check parameters passed to the big integer library, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted public key to a program that uses HTTPS client certificates or SSH server libraries."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "Improper parameter validation in the Verify function of the crypto/dsa/dsa.go library when handling big integer routines.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Infinite loop vulnerability in big integer routines."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability causes an infinite loop, rendering the application unresponsive.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted public key, which is triggered by applications using HTTPS client authentication or the Go SSH server libraries."
    },
    "Affected Products": [
      "Go before 1.5.4",
      "Go 1.6.x before 1.6.1",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7",
      "openSUSE Leap 42.1"
    ],
    "Additional Information": {
        "Red Hat Advisory": "RHSA-2016:1538",
         "SUSE Bugzilla": "974232",
         "OpenSUSE Advisory": "openSUSE-SU-2016:1331-1",
         "Fix": "The issue is fixed in Go 1.5.4 and 1.6.1",
           "Note": "The issue affects programs that utilize HTTPS client authentication or the Go SSH server libraries, making them vulnerable to DoS attacks using crafted public keys."
        }
