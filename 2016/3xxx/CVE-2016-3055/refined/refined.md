- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the presence of XXE (XML External Entity) and XML Bomb vulnerabilities in FileNet Workplace.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - XXE vulnerability: This occurs when an XML parser processes an XML document containing references to external entities. This could allow an attacker to read local files or trigger denial-of-service by referencing external entities.
    - XML Bomb vulnerability: Also known as a Billion Laughs attack, it involves using nested entities to exponentially expand the XML content, causing a denial-of-service attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the following:
    -  Reading of local files.
    -  Denial-of-service attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves processing maliciously crafted XML documents by the FileNet Workplace application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply specially crafted XML to the FileNet Workplace application.
