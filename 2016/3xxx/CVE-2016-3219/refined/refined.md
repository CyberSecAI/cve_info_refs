    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3219",
      "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run processes in an elevated context.",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver (Win32k.sys)",
      "vulnerability": "Elevation of Privilege",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run processes in an elevated context.",
      "attack_vector": "Local attack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to execute a specially crafted application on the target system."

    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-3219",
      "description": "Itâ€™s possible to bypass the ProcessFontDisablePolicy check in win32k to load a custom font from an arbitrary file on disk even in a sandbox.",
       "root_cause": "Race condition in the ProcessFontDisablePolicy check within win32k. The check first opens the font, checks its location, closes the handle and reopens the font to map it. ",
      "vulnerability": "Security Feature Bypass",
      "impact": "An attacker can load a custom font from an arbitrary file, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This is due to the bypass of the intended font loading policy.",
      "attack_vector": "Local attack. Abusing object manager directory shadows to cause a race condition during font loading.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Low integrity user on the target system. The attacker needs to copy a custom font file to a writable directory and execute a PoC to trigger the race condition."
