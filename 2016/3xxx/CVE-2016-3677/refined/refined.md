Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Huawei Wear and HiLink apps do not properly validate SSL certificates when accessing websites. Specifically, the apps will continue to load web pages even if the SSL certificate has issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of SSL Certificate Validation:** The core issue is that the apps fail to check the validity of SSL certificates, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Risk to Users:** By loading a web page with an invalid SSL certificate, the app exposes users to potential risks such as:
    *   **Data interception:** An attacker could intercept data transmitted between the app and the malicious server.
    *   **Phishing attacks:** Users could be redirected to fake login pages or other malicious sites.
    *   **Malware distribution:** A malicious website could potentially distribute malware to users through the vulnerable app.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the app and the legitimate server, then present a malicious website with an invalid certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic, typically by being on the same network as the user.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Huawei Wear App (Android versions earlier than WearAPP-15.0.0.307)
    *   Huawei HiLink App (Android versions earlier than HiLink-3.19.2)
*   **CVSS Score:**
    *   Base Score: 2.6 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P) which indicates a low risk
    *   Temporal Score: 2.2 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
*   The vulnerability has low risk because the Huawei Wear app and HiLink app loads only certain secure websites.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Akshay Jain.
*   Huawei has released updates to resolve this vulnerability.
