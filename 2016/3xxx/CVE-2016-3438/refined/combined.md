# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 136 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Starting with this Critical Patch Update, security vulnerabilities are now scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0). Previous Critical Patch Updates were scored using CVSS version 2.0. To aid in the transition from CVSS version 2.0 to CVSS version 3.0 scoring, for this Critical Patch Update only, both scores are provided (see  [Critical Patch Update - April 2016 CVSS version 2.0](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016.html)).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2016 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2102148.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2102148.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) . Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2016verbose.html#JAVA) .

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
2. Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.
3. Applies to client and server deployment of JSSE

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
