Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and filter bypass in the FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer web applications. Specifically, the `filename` parameter within the `Layout Header [Header Image]` module is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. The application fails to sanitize the filename parameter when uploading an image, allowing injection of malicious script code.
- Filter bypass, which allows the malicious script to be injected through the vulnerable parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Persistent phishing attacks.
  - Session hijacking.
  - Persistent external redirects to malicious websites.
  - Application-side manipulation of the affected module context, and potentially other connected web module contexts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack via the web application interface.
- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged web application user account.
- The attacker injects malicious script code into the `filename` parameter during the upload of a header image. This is done by intercepting the HTTP request and modifying the `filename` value during a session tamper.
- The injected script is then executed when the filename is displayed, leading to the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a low-privileged user account on the FortiManager/FortiAnalyzer web application.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This can be done by using a session tamper tool.
-  Low user interaction is required since the user needs to click and interact with the application to upload the image and for the injected code to execute.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `Advanced Settings - Advanced Settings - Layout Header` module, specifically the `Header Image` section.
- The vulnerable parameter is `filename` in the `/report/graphic/upload/` module.
- The request method is POST.
- The issue is present in multiple versions of FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity and with CVSS score of 3.7 (in seclists.org) and 4.1 (in vulnerability-lab.com)
