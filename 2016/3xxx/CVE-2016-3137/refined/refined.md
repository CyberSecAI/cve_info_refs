      "CWE": "CWE-122",
       "Description": "Ignat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check the length of data received for a USB buffer. This allowed denial of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to impersonate it over the network. A system configured as a usbip server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.",

    "Vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds write",
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system crash) or possibly arbitrary code execution",
  "Attack vector": "A remote attacker (when the system is a usbip client) or a physically present user (when the system is a usbip server)",
  "Required capabilities":"A malicious usbip server or attacker impersonating a server, or a physically proximate user with malicious usbip device when the system is a usbip server."
