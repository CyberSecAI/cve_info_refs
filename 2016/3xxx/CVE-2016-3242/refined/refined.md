- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system, enabling them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website designed to trigger the memory corruption. Attackers can also leverage compromised websites or those that host user-provided content by injecting malicious code. The victim has to be convinced to visit the malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one to deliver the exploit. They also need to trick the user into visiting the malicious page.
