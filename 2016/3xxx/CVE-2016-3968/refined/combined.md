#### Sophos Cyberoam NG Series Multiple Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

Title: Sophos Cyberoam NG Series Multiple Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2016-5313](ZSL-2016-5313.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Cross-Site Scripting

Risk: (2/5)

Release Date: 04.04.2016
##### Summary

Cyberoam NG series of Unified Threat Management appliances are
the Next-Generation network security appliances that include UTM security
features along with performance required for future networks. The NG series
for SMEs are the 'fastest UTMs' made for this segment. The best-in-class
hardware along with software to match, enables the NG series to offer unmatched
throughput speeds, compared to any other UTM appliance in this market segment.
This assures support for future IT trends in organizations like high-speed
Internet and rising number of devices in organizations – offering future-ready
security to SMEs.
##### Description

Multiple reflected XSS issues were discovered in Cyberoam NG appliances.
Input passed via the 'ipFamily', 'applicationname' and 'username' GET parameters
to LiveConnections.jsp and LiveConnectionDetail.jsp is not properly sanitised
before being returned to the user. Adding arbitrary 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header
to a request makes the appliance also prone to a XSS issue. This can be exploited
to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context
of an affected site.
