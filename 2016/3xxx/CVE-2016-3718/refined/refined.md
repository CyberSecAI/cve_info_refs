Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within ImageMagick's coders, particularly the HTTP and FTP coders. This allows an attacker to inject malicious URLs that, when processed by ImageMagick, can result in the application making unintended server-side requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The core vulnerability is SSRF. An attacker can craft an image that, when processed by ImageMagick, will cause the application to make HTTP GET or FTP requests to arbitrary URLs. The vulnerable coders are primarily HTTP and FTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By making requests to internal network resources, the attacker can potentially gather sensitive information or scan the internal network.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could potentially overload an internal service by targeting it with numerous requests through the vulnerable application using ImageMagick.
*   **Lateral Movement:** In conjunction with other vulnerabilities, this can be used as a pivot point to compromise additional systems on the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Image Files:** Attackers inject specially crafted URLs into image files, particularly within formats like SVG and MVG, that ImageMagick processes using delegates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote, often sending a crafted image to be processed by a vulnerable service.
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to craft an image file containing a malicious URL.
*   **No Authentication Required:** In many cases, this vulnerability does not require authentication to exploit. The vulnerability exists in the way ImageMagick handles its input.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs because ImageMagick uses the `system()` command to pass URLs to delegate programs (like `wget` or `curl`) for processing. This lacks proper sanitization, enabling the attacker to inject malicious URLs.
*   The vulnerability is present in ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.3-10 and 7.x prior to 7.0.1-1.
*   A common exploit involves crafting an image that contains a URL with shell characters such as | (pipe) to execute shell commands in addition to the SSRF.
*   Mitigation usually involves disabling the vulnerable coders (like EPHEMERAL, URL, HTTPS, MVG, MSL, TEXT, SHOW, WIN, PLT) in the `policy.xml` file, or sanitizing input URLs before processing.
*  The vulnerability is exploitable regardless of the file extension as ImageMagick detects file types based on their content.
*  Specifically, vulnerable coders such as "label" can be used for local file reading by specifying a path in the crafted image.

**Mitigation:**

*   Disable vulnerable coders through the `policy.xml` file.
*   Sanitize input URLs before processing them with ImageMagick.
*   Verify that image files start with the expected "magic bytes" corresponding to supported file types.
*   Sandboxing ImageMagick to further isolate the processes and limit potential damage.
