Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3912:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue within the framework APIs where a local malicious application could exploit a flaw to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The provided commit message indicates that the root cause is related to the accidental launch of a broadcast receiver in an incorrect app instance, which occurs while recycling a process ID with a pending launch.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability allows a local application to gain elevated capabilities by executing code within a privileged process, specifically due to an issue with the recycling of process IDs and pending launches.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables the execution of arbitrary code within a privileged process.
*   **Local Access to Elevated Capabilities:** This could give malicious applications access to capabilities and data that are not normally accessible to them.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector involves a local malicious application installed on the Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided code commit [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/6c049120c2d749f0c0289d822ec7d0aa692f55c5](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/6c049120c2d749f0c0289d822ec7d0aa692f55c5) shows a change to handle recycling of pids with pending launches.
* The vulnerability is rated as High severity, indicating a significant risk of exploitation with serious consequences.

In summary, CVE-2016-3912 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Android framework APIs that could allow a local malicious app to execute code within a privileged process by exploiting an incorrect handling of process ID recycling, ultimately granting the malicious app access to elevated capabilities.
