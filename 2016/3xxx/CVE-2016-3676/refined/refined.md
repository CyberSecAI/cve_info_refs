- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Huawei E3276s products have an integrity protection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of integrity protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: User communication can be intercepted, spoofed, and injected with traffic. Users may be connected to a fake network.
- **Attack vectors**: Adjacent network access is required (AV:A). The attack does not require authentication (Au:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be within the adjacent network (e.g. local network).
