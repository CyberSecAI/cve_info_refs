Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-3956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The npm command-line interface (CLI) was designed to send HTTP bearer tokens with every request made by logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request. This was a design flaw as these tokens should only be included for requests made against the registry or registries used for the current install.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bearer Token Leakage:** The vulnerability allowed for the unintentional leakage of bearer tokens. These tokens are used for authentication with the npm registry.
- **Insecure Transmission:** Bearer tokens were sent with *every* request, including those to servers that were not the npm registry, creating an opportunity for unauthorized interception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Impersonation:** An attacker could set up a malicious HTTP server to collect leaked bearer tokens.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** With stolen tokens, an attacker could impersonate legitimate users and perform actions such as:
    - Publishing new versions of packages.
    - Any other action the compromised user was authorized to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could position a malicious server to intercept requests from npm CLI.
- **Compromised Servers:** Any HTTP server that a logged-in npm user's CLI would interact with could potentially collect the bearer token if it was not the npm registry.
- A user downloading packages from a non-registry host could expose their bearer token if the always-auth flag was set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept HTTP requests made by a logged-in npm user's CLI
- The attacker needs to set up an HTTP server capable of capturing the authentication information
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the user but they need to be able to intercept requests

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability was fixed in `npm@2.15.1` (npm LTS) and `npm@3.8.3`.
-   Users who believe their bearer tokens may have been leaked should invalidate their current tokens and rerun `npm login`.
-   The fix ensures that bearer tokens are only sent with requests made against a registry, resolving the token leakage issue.
- The fix involved changes to `lib/utils/map-to-registry.js` and related test files to implement the token scoping.
- The issue was tracked at  [#8380](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8380) on GitHub.
