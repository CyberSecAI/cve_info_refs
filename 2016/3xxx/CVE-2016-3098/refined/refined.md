- Root cause of vulnerability: The `Administrate::ApplicationController` actions lacked CSRF protection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can hijack user sessions and use any functionality exposed by the administrate gem on behalf of the user. This could include hijacking the user's OAuth authorization code.
- Attack vectors: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability through a crafted web request targeting the affected application.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to send a forged request to the vulnerable application.
