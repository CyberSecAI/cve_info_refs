Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3382:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the scripting engine of Microsoft browsers (Internet Explorer and Edge). Specifically, it arises from the way the scripting engine renders and handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption in the scripting engine.
- Improper handling of objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers could inject malicious code into compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.
- **ActiveX controls:**  Embedding a malicious ActiveX control (marked "safe for initialization") within an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the scripting engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into existing websites.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious document containing a malicious ActiveX control.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in both Internet Explorer and Edge browsers.
- The severity is rated as Critical on Windows clients and Moderate on Windows servers.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.
