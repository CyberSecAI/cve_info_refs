- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper content validation within IBM Security Access Manager appliances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system fails to properly validate content, allowing an attacker to bypass security restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can bypass security restrictions and load a page with malicious content.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by persuading a victim to open specially crafted content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious content and persuade a victim to open it. No specific attacker position is mentioned, it is assumed the attack is remote.
