Root cause of vulnerability:
The capability check to view other users' badges was performed for the current user instead of the user whose badges are being viewed.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Incorrect context for capability check, leading to unauthorized access.

Impact of exploitation:
Users could view the badges of other users without proper permissions.

Attack vectors:
By accessing the page that displays user badges.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Any logged-in user of Moodle could potentially view badges of other users.
