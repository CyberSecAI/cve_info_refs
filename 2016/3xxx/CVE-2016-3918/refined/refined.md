Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3918:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how the AOSP Email application handles IDs.  Specifically, the application was not properly limiting the `id` and `account id` parameters, treating them as arbitrary paths instead of the intended long integer values.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability due to the lack of input validation on the `id` and `account id` parameters in the AOSP Mail application. This allows a malicious application to potentially access sensitive information by crafting specific path-like strings for these parameters.
*  **Impact:** This vulnerability allows a local malicious application to bypass operating system protections and access application data without proper permissions.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local malicious application exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the capability to install and run a malicious application on the affected device.

**Technical Details:**

The provided commit message clarifies that the fix involves limiting both `id` and `account id` to be parsed as long integers. If parsing fails, an error is logged and null is returned, preventing the use of arbitrary path-like strings for these parameters. This ensures that only legitimate ID values are processed, preventing access to data beyond authorized permissions.

The commit message also indicates the fix was tested with the reported attack.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is rated as High severity due to the potential for unauthorized access to data.
* The vulnerability affects all Nexus devices, and corresponding fixes were made in AOSP versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, and 7.0.
