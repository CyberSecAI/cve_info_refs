### @pecameron **[pecameron](/pecameron)** commented [Apr 1, 2016](#issue-145267880)

The cookie currently returns the openshift internal pod IP address.

This is a security issue as an attacker can develop a map of the pods

in the cluster just by observing the returned cookie.

This change returns a hash of the internal address and internal service

name to obfuscate the internal information. The service name is configured

when the service is created and is not visible to outside users. This

in combination with the internal ip:port is hashed and presented in the

cookie.

Why is this inconsistent with the call a few lines above. I'd lose hash above.

Assuming this is necessary (it's weird to me you are walking this table twice, but I haven't actually looked at it) I think the idiomatic go way to update the values stored in items in a slice would be:

```
for i := range svc.EndpointTable {
    endpoint := &svc.EndpointTable[i]
    hash := $WHATEVER
    endpoint.IDHash = fmt.Sprintf(....hash)
}

```

Notice endpoint is a pointer to the value.

Now if I were going to write it your way, because I didn't really understand or want to use pointers but did want to make use of the return values of `range` it should look like:

```
for i, endpoint := range svc.EndpointTable {
    hash := $WHATEVER
    svc.EndpointTable[i].IDhash = fmt.Sprintf("%x", hash)
}

```

I think you missed [@eparis](https://github.com/eparis)' comment about the go idioms.

It's ugly that we have to do the same thing in two places though. Perhaps make a private function that computes a hash value from an Endpoints structure?

Didn't miss it, misunderstood it. I will make a private function as you

suggest.

Better to do this when we add an endpoint - see: `https://github.com/pecameron/origin/blob/bz1318796/pkg/router/template/router.go#L507` rather than in here `endpointsForAlias`.

Reason is `endpointsForAlias` is called every time we handle the template (router config) and there would be multiple calls in the lifetime of a router (as endpoints/routes get added/removed/modified). It's not performant to calculate the IDHash for all the endpoints on every single call to `endpointsForAlias`.

Just do it once when we add the endpoint.

That way, you can also inline the function as it will be only used in a single place.

| As discussed over email - testing that the IdHash is valid looks fine but as re: the test failures for:  ``` --- FAIL: TestAddEndpointDuplicates (0.00s)       router_test.go:123: add same endpoints expected to return false but got true   W0405 15:21:34.318716   26055 router.go:696] a edge terminated route with host edgetermfalse does   not have the required certificates. The route will still be created but no certificates will be written   W0405 15:21:34.319183   26055 router.go:696] a reencrypt terminated route with host  reencrypttermfalse does not have the required certificates.  The route will still be created but no   certificates will be written   FAIL    ```  There is a check above the added code to ensure that if we add the same endpoints, we don't reload the router (return false from here basically since the config is unchanged). But since we now set the IdHash below this check, the 2 objects will never match up. So better to just move setting the IdHash to `plugin.go#createRouterEndpoints`. |

The cookie currently returns the openshift internal pod IP address.
This is a security issue as an attacker can develop a map of the pods
in the cluster just by observing the returned cookie.

This change returns a hash of the internal address and internal service
name to obfuscate the internal information. The service name is configured
when the service is created and is not visible to outside users. This
in combination with the internal ip:port is hashed and presented in the
cookie.

| [@eparis](https://github.com/eparis) We have done some stuff. Most of the tests are no longer using them (they didn't really need them anyway). We can also switch zones if it continues to be a problem. I need to (or someone does) to do a little research to pick the best one to move to if we are going to switch. |
