  "CVE-2016-3110": {
    "description": "It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod_cluster via service messages (MCMP).",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in mod_cluster's mod_manager component when processing service messages (MCMP) with a specially crafted string.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a segmentation fault, leading to a server crash (Denial of Service).",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, via specially crafted mod_cluster service messages.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted service message to the mod_cluster component. The targeted VirtualHost must be configured to receive service messages from worker nodes. If the administrator has not opened a secure management port to the internet without any authentication, then exploiting this from an untrusted client will not be possible."
