| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-07 22:52:38 UTC  ``` Dominic Scheirlinck of VendHQ reports:  Many software projects and vendors have implemented support for the “Proxy” request header in their respective CGI implementations and languages by creating the “HTTP_PROXY” environmental variable based on the header value. When this variable is used (in many cases automatically by various HTTP client libraries) any outgoing requests generated in turn from the attackers original request can be redirected to an attacker controlled proxy. This allows attackers to view potentially sensitive information, reply with malformed data, or to hold connections open causing a potential denial of service.   The Apache HTTPD server sets various environmental variables based on headers that can then be used in CGI scripts (e.g. via mod_cgi). If passed a “Proxy” header in the request Apache will automatically populate the HTTP_PROXY environmental variable with whatever user supplied value is present.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-07 22:52:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Scott Geary (VendHQ)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2016-07-18 14:30:20 UTC  ``` Detailed write-up from the original reporter:  <https://httpoxy.org/>  Advisory from the Apache Software Foundation (which covers httpd, and also Tomcat and Traffic Server):  <https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt>  ASF plans to address this issue in httpd versions 2.4.24 and 2.2.32.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2016-07-18 14:30:57 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/httpoxy> <https://httpoxy.org/> <https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c14)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-07-18 15:31:38 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1357597](show_bug.cgi?id=1357597 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5387 Apache HTTPD: sets environmental variable based on user supplied Proxy request header [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-07-18 15:33:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:1420 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1420](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1420)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-07-18 16:50:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:1422 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1422](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1422)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-07-18 17:29:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2016:1421 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1421](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1421)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1353755#c25)  Fedora Update System    2016-07-22 15:58:56 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.23-4.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-7813edd5a2
2019-05-10 00:46:38.157862
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mod\_cluster
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.3.11
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://modcluster.io/>
Summary : Apache HTTP Server dynamic load balancer with Wildfly and Tomcat libraries
Description :
Mod\_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like mod\_jk and mod\_proxy,
mod\_cluster uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to one
of a set of application server nodes. Unlike mod\_jk and mod\_proxy, mod\_cluster
leverages an additional connection between the application server nodes and
httpd. The application server nodes use this connection to transmit server-side
load balance factors and lifecycle events back to httpd via a custom set of
HTTP methods, affectionately called the Mod-Cluster Management Protocol (MCMP).
This additional feedback channel allows mod\_cluster to offer a level of
intelligence and granularity not found in other load balancing solutions.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 14:04:59 UTC  ``` Quoting form the draft of OpenSSL upstream advisory:  EVP_EncodeUpdate overflow ([CVE-2016-2105](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2105)) =========================================  Severity: Low  An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.  Internally to OpenSSL the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM_write_bio* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM_write_bio* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 3rd March 2016 by Guido Vranken. The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 14:05:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the OpenSSL project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 14:06:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1151923](attachment.cgi?id=1151923&action=diff "OpenSSL upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1151923&action=edit "OpenSSL upstream fix") OpenSSL upstream fix   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c5)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:19:29 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c6)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:28:36 UTC  ```  Created openssl101e tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1332590](show_bug.cgi?id=1332590 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 openssl101e: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c7)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:28:42 UTC  ```  Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332588](show_bug.cgi?id=1332588 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c8)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:28:48 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332589](show_bug.cgi?id=1332589 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 mingw-openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1332591](show_bug.cgi?id=1332591 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 mingw-openssl: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-04 13:28:25 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5b814481f3573fa9677f3a31ee51322e2a22ee6a>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c11)  Fedora Update System    2016-05-04 18:51:30 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.2h-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2055)

## Topic

Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.10 natives, fix several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

This release includes bug fixes and enhancements, as well as a new release of OpenSSL. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)
* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)

Red Hat would like to thank Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

## Topic

Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.10 natives, fix several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

This release includes bug fixes and enhancements, as well as a new release of OpenSSL. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)
* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)

Red Hat would like to thank Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-3877efca99
2019-05-10 01:35:04.470032
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mod\_cluster
Product : Fedora 28
Version : 1.3.11
Release : 1.fc28
URL : <http://modcluster.io/>
Summary : Apache HTTP Server dynamic load balancer with Wildfly and Tomcat libraries
Description :
Mod\_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like mod\_jk and mod\_proxy,
mod\_cluster uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to one
of a set of application server nodes. Unlike mod\_jk and mod\_proxy, mod\_cluster
leverages an additional connection between the application server nodes and
httpd. The application server nodes use this connection to transmit server-side
load balance factors and lifecycle events back to httpd via a custom set of
HTTP methods, affectionately called the Mod-Cluster Management Protocol (MCMP).
This additional feedback channel allows mod\_cluster to offer a level of
intelligence and granularity not found in other load balancing solutions.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c0)  Timothy Walsh    2016-04-12 12:11:43 UTC  ``` It is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod_cluster via service messages (MCMP).  Only the VirtualHost explicitly enabled by an administrator to receive service messages from worker nodes (Tomcat or EAP workers). Unless the administrator made a grave mistake in opening an unsecured mod_cluster management VirtualHost to the Internet without any authentication, it is impossible to exploit this bug from an untrusted client.  Special set of mod_cluster management protocol HTTP method requests. One could pass a certain number of = symbols in sequence after a legitimate element and cause segfault.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c1)  Timothy Walsh    2016-04-12 12:11:54 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michal Karm Babacek   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-22 18:09:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1  Via RHSA-2016:1650 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1650.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-22 18:11:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2016:1649 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1649.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-22 18:12:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:1648 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1648.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c8)  Timothy Walsh    2016-09-08 09:07:27 UTC  ```  Created mod_cluster tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1374210](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-3110 mod_cluster: remotely Segfault Apache http server [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1374211](show_bug.cgi?id=1374211 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-3110 mod_cluster: remotely Segfault Apache http server [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-10-12 16:59:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.10  Via RHSA-2016:2056 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2056.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-10-12 17:08:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:2054 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2054.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1326320#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-10-12 17:19:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2016:2055 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2055.html>   ``` |  |

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 28 Feature Freeze Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [glibc 2.27](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC227 "Changes/GLIBC227")
* [gcc 8.0](/wiki/Changes/GCC8 "Changes/GCC8")
* [Hardening Flags](/wiki/Changes/HardeningFlags28 "Changes/HardeningFlags28")
* [Mingw and MiniDebugInfo](/wiki/Changes/MingwMiniDebugInfo "Changes/MingwMiniDebugInfo")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Tuesday, February 6th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Bodhi Enablement Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f28
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f28. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f28 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f28
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

* [Packages that failed to build](https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f28-failures.html)
* [Packages that need to be rebuilt](https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f28-need-rebuild.html)
* [(F28FTBFS) Fedora 28 Mass Rebuild FTBFS Tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1555378)

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a rpm build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2018-02-06 01:20:06.000000 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f28-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f28 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1649)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1 for
RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
(mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
Native library.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0,
and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1
Release Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the
most significant of these changes.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1. The JBoss server
process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP

requests to initialize the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts,
which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations
to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could
possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script
to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
(CVE-2016-5387)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of
input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application
using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts
of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an
application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2106)

* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http

server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service
messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting
CVE-2016-5387; the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2105 and
CVE-2016-2106; and Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110.
Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-2105 and CVE-2016-2106.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server
installation (including all applications and configuration files).

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes
described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library
must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.1 Release Notes for a
list of non security related fixes.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1648)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1 for
RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
(mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
Native library.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0,
and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1
Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
available shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/>

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1. The JBoss server
process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP

requests to initialize the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts,
which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations
to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could
possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script
to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
(CVE-2016-5387)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of
input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application
using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts
of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an
application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2106)

* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http

server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service
messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting
CVE-2016-5387; the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2105 and
CVE-2016-2106; and Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110.
Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-2105 and CVE-2016-2106.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server
installation (including all applications and configuration files).

Note: Do not install Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2 on a host which has Red Hat
JBoss Web Server 1 installed.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes
described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library
must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.1 Release Notes for a list of non security related fixes..

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210#c0)  Timothy Walsh    2016-09-08 09:07:08 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of Fedora.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.  [bug automatically created by: add-tracking-bugs]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210#c1)  Timothy Walsh    2016-09-08 09:07:14 UTC  ```  Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1326320,1374210  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [CVE-2016-3110](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3110)  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210#c2)  Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client    2016-09-08 11:16:14 UTC  ``` This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210#c3)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-07-25 22:54:18 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 24 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 2 (two) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 24. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '24'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 24 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210#c4)  Jan Kurik    2017-08-08 11:29:36 UTC  ``` Fedora 24 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2017-08-08. Fedora 24 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates.  As this is a security big we are moving this bug to the currently latest supported release. Please check whether this bug is still applicable.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210#c5)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:10:52 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '25'.

In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.  [1] <https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1736>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1374210#c7)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 15:24:24 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-17556e2ad6
2019-05-10 02:21:33.370624
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mod\_cluster
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 1.3.11
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <http://modcluster.io/>
Summary : Apache HTTP Server dynamic load balancer with Wildfly and Tomcat libraries
Description :
Mod\_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like mod\_jk and mod\_proxy,
mod\_cluster uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to one
of a set of application server nodes. Unlike mod\_jk and mod\_proxy, mod\_cluster
leverages an additional connection between the application server nodes and
httpd. The application server nodes use this connection to transmit server-side
load balance factors and lifecycle events back to httpd via a custom set of
HTTP methods, affectionately called the Mod-Cluster Management Protocol (MCMP).
This additional feedback channel allows mod\_cluster to offer a level of
intelligence and granularity not found in other load balancing solutions.
