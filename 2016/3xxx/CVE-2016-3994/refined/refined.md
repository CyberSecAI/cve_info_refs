  "cveId": "CVE-2016-3994",
  "description": "The GIF loader in imlib2 before 1.4.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or obtain sensitive information via a crafted image, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the GIF loader of imlib2 when handling a crafted GIF image.",
    "weaknesses": [

    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially leak sensitive information.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attack vector is through a crafted GIF image.",
      "Network"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted GIF file to an application using imlib2."

    "additionalNotes": "The issue stems from incorrect handling of color map data in the GIF loader. The vulnerability is triggered by an out-of-bounds read during the processing of pixel data, leading to a potential crash or information disclosure. Patches have been applied in multiple distributions to address the issue, including checks to ensure that indices used to access the color map are valid."
