The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin that discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver, including CVE-2016-3338.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from the CLFS driver's improper handling of objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is categorized as an elevation of privilege issue, meaning that the improper handling of objects in memory allows for an attacker to run processes in an elevated context

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run processes with elevated privileges, potentially gaining complete control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is local, requiring the attacker to first log on to the system. They then execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have a valid logon to the system to run the crafted application. They don't need to be in a privileged position initially but gain privileges by exploiting the vulnerability
