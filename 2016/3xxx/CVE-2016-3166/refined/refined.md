Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2016-3166:

**CVE-2016-3166**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `drupal_set_header()` function in Drupal allows HTTP header injection if user-generated content is passed as a header value on sites running PHP versions older than 5.1.2. The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data before using it to set HTTP headers.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP header injection vulnerability.  Specifically, the injection happens when line breaks are included in the user-submitted data, allowing an attacker to set arbitrary headers.

*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers by including line breaks in user-submitted content. This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):**  By injecting malicious JavaScript through headers like `Content-Type` or `Set-Cookie`.
    *   **Session hijacking:** By manipulating `Set-Cookie` headers.
    *   **Cache poisoning:** By injecting headers that control caching behavior.
    *   Other header-based attacks.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs a module to be installed on the Drupal site that allows user-submitted data to appear in HTTP headers.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when user-generated content with line breaks is used as a header value through the `drupal_set_header()` function.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the website that will be used to construct HTTP headers.
    *  The attacker must target a Drupal installation running on PHP versions older than 5.1.2.
*   **Mitigations**: Upgrading PHP to a version greater than 5.1.2 prevents the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
* The CVE assignment message notes that the CVE ID was assigned because Drupal issued a security advisory, and other vendors might choose not to fix the issue on older PHP versions, suggesting the issue is not exploitable if the user upgrades to a supported version of PHP.
