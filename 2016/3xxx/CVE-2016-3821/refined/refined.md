  "CVE-2016-3821": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability in Mediaserver could enable an attacker using a specially crafted file to cause memory corruption during media file and data processing. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process. The Mediaserver process has access to audio and video streams, as well as access to privileges that third-party apps could not normally access.",
    "Root cause": "Memory corruption due to improper handling of media files or data within the Mediaserver.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory management",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process, allowing an attacker to potentially gain access to audio and video streams, as well as access to other privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted media files",
      "Multiple methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft malicious media files and deliver them to a vulnerable device. This can be done remotely through several methods.",
        "Additional Information": "The provided commit message indicates a fix for a bug where `sp<...>` was being used incorrectly which could lead to null pointer dereferences after a null check. The specific code change involves avoiding the use of a potentially null smart pointer after checking for null, likely related to handling media data."

   "CVE-2016-3820": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability in libavc could enable an attacker using a specially crafted file to cause memory corruption during media file and data processing.",
        "Root cause": "Memory corruption due to improper handling of media files in libavc.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory management",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution due to memory corruption in libavc.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted media files."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft malicious media files and deliver them to a vulnerable device.",
         "Additional Information": "The provided commit message states `Decoder: Fix slice number increment for error clips`, indicating the issue was with how the decoder handled slice numbers during error clipping. This likely was triggering a bug leading to memory corruption during processing."
