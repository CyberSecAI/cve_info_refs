Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-3389:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in the Chakra JavaScript engine within Microsoft Edge. Specifically, the way the engine handles objects in memory leads to this corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that the Chakra JavaScript engine is vulnerable to memory corruption when processing certain objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, modify or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability via Microsoft Edge. Users who visit this website become vulnerable.
- **Compromised Websites/Content:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised or user-content-hosting websites or advertisements that could exploit this vulnerability.
- **ActiveX Controls:** Attackers could embed a malicious ActiveX control, marked as safe for initialization, into an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a document containing malicious code. Direct user interaction is necessary, as the attacker cannot force the user to view the malicious content.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** An attacker needs to host the malicious website or inject the malicious code into a website/advertisement or a document that can be loaded into the Microsoft Edge browser.
