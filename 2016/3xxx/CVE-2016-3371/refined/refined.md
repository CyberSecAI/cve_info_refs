Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-3371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way the Windows Kernel API enforces permissions, specifically how it restricts access to user information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Permission Enforcement:** The core issue lies in the Windows Kernel API not correctly enforcing user permissions and access controls, leading to unauthorized information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to gain access to information that is not intended for the user. This could include sensitive user data.
- **Data Leakage:** Exploiting the vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of user data that should be protected by the system, potentially compromising confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Locally Authenticated Attacker:** The attacker needs to have a local account on the target system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The exploit requires the attacker to execute a specially crafted application that takes advantage of the permission enforcement flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log in and execute code on the target machine.
- **Ability to Run Code:** The attacker needs to be able to run the specially crafted application designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided exploit code leverages `NtLoadKeyEx` to load a registry hive at an arbitrary attachment point. It then registers a type library with a COM scriptlet moniker, causing arbitrary code to execute when `LoadTypeLib` is called, effectively elevating privileges.
- The exploit code uses the local system account's "Classes" key in the registry to achieve this privilege escalation.
- The exploit triggers the execution of the malicious script by locking and then unlocking the workstation, demonstrating a specific trigger, however there are other possible triggers.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2016-3371 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability due to improper permission handling by the Windows Kernel API, that an attacker can exploit by loading a registry hive at a specific location and registering a COM object. This allows the attacker to gain access to sensitive information and achieve privilege escalation. The vulnerability requires a local attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
