  "CVE-2016-3632": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in libtiff v4.0.6 when using the thumbnail command. The vulnerability exists in the _TIFFVGetField() function in tif_dirinfo.c. An attacker could control the head data of the next heap, which contains the pre_size and size fields, to cause a DoS or potentially code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the _TIFFVGetField() function in tif_dirinfo.c, specifically during the processing of thumbnail commands. This function does not properly validate the size of data being written, leading to out-of-bounds writes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted TIFF image",
      "Use of thumbnail command"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious TIFF file, and then entice a user or application to process that file using a vulnerable version of libtiff's thumbnail tool.",
