  "cve_id": "CVE-2016-6197",
  "description": "It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Linux kernel versions prior to the fix"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel lacked proper verification of dentry state before unlink and rename operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of dentry state in OverlayFS leading to a race condition."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could trigger a denial of service (system crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is exploitable by a local unprivileged user through the rename syscall on an overlayfs mount on top of xfs."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user."
