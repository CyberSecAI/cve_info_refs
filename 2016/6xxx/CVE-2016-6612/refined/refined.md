Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `LOAD LOCAL INFILE` functionality within phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Exposure:** A user with sufficient privileges can exploit the `LOAD LOCAL INFILE` feature to expose arbitrary files on the server to the database system. This occurs because the application allows specifying a local file path for loading data into a database table, and this path can be manipulated to access files outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive files on the server where phpMyAdmin is hosted. This information could include configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data depending on what is accessible by the web server process running phpMyAdmin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `LOAD LOCAL INFILE` functionality of MySQL, which can be invoked through the phpMyAdmin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of phpMyAdmin and have sufficient database privileges to execute the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command.
- An attacker needs to have knowledge of the file system structure of the server to be able to specify valid file paths.
