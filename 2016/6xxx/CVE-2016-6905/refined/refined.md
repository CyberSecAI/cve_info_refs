CVE-2016-6905:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `read_image_tga` function within `gd_tga.c`. This function processes TGA image files, and a crafted TGA file can trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the way the function handles image data, causing an attempt to read past the end of an allocated buffer.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
    - Out-of-bounds read in the `read_image_tga` function.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted TGA image, as the out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash.  In some cases it can lead to information disclosure if the out of bounds area contains sensitive data.
  - Attack vectors: A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted TGA image to an application that utilizes the affected `libgd` library.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted TGA image to the targeted application. No specific attacker capabilities are required other than knowledge of this vulnerability and ability to create a crafted TGA file.

Additional details:
  - The fix for this vulnerability involved changes to the way encoded pixels are handled and bounds checking.
  - The vulnerability was addressed in libgd version 2.2.3.
  - The vulnerability is present in the handling of RLE compression in TGA images, where a malformed image can cause the decompression logic to try to read past allocated memory.
  - The fix includes checks to make sure that read operations stay within the bounds of allocated buffers.
  - The provided information references multiple different commits, and multiple SUSE bugzilla entries relating to this CVE and related TGA parsing issues. This is because the issue was originally reported and fixed in an incorrect way before being corrected.
