  "summary": "The provided documents discuss a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the php_stream_zip_opener function within PHP, identified as CVE-2016-6297. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code by manipulating the path length when opening a zip stream.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation of the path length in the `php_stream_zip_opener` function. An integer overflow can occur in the calculation of the length of `memcpy`, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by triggering a segmentation fault or, under certain conditions, potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input to PHP that triggers the vulnerable code path in the zip stream opener.",
    "remediation": "The vulnerability is resolved by updating PHP to version 5.6.28 or later, which includes a fix that addresses the integer overflow issue and prevents the subsequent buffer overflow. The fix involves using `size_t` to store path lengths, thus preventing the integer overflow."
  },
  "affected_packages": [
    "dev-lang/php on all architectures < 5.6.28",
    "rh-php56-php packages before versions 5.5.38, 5.6.24, and 7.0.9"

  ],
  "additional_details": "The bugzilla entry from redhat.com mentions that the vulnerability is limited to a crash and is unlikely to result in arbitrary code execution due to compile-time buffer overflow protection. Additionally, the bug report from php.net describes the specific code vulnerable to integer overflow and the patch applied to prevent the buffer overflow by using `size_t` instead of `int` for path length variables. The Apple document also highlights that updating PHP to version 5.6.24 addresses this issue along with several others."
