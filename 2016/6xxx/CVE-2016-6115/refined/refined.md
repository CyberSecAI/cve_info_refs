- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS), specifically within IBM Spectrum Scale, related to file encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges or cause the server to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attack vector over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated. Additionally, the vulnerability is only exploitable if file encryption is being used, and the key management infrastructure has been compromised.
