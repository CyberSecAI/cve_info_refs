Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in IBM Jazz Foundation, which allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the web UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI. This could lead to:
  - Altering the intended functionality of the web application.
  - Potential disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by a malicious user who has the ability to post content to the web application.
- The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code which is stored in the application's database and executed by other users who view the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to post or modify content within the affected IBM Jazz Foundation application.
- User interaction is required since the malicious script is executed when the victim views the crafted content.
