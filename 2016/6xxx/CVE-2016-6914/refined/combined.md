RCE Security Advisory

1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        Ubiquiti UniFi Video (Windows)
Vendor URL:     https://www.ubnt.com
Type:           Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
                [CWE-280]
Date found:     2016-05-24
Date published: 2017-12-20
CVSSv3 Score:   7.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
CVE:            CVE-2016-6914

2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.

3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
UniFi Video 3.7.3 (Windows),
UniFi Video 3.7.0 (Windows),
UniFi Video 3.2.2 (Windows),
older versions may be affected too.

4. INTRODUCTION
===============
UniFi Video is a powerful and flexible, integrated IP video management
surveillance system designed to work with Ubiquiti’s UniFi Video Camera product
line. UniFi Video has an intuitive, configurable, and feature‑packed user
interface with advanced features such as motion detection, auto‑discovery,
user-level security, storage management, reporting, and mobile device support.

(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
Ubiquiti UniFi Video for Windows is installed to "C:\ProgramData\unifi-video\"
by default and is also shipped with a service called "Ubiquiti UniFi Video". Its
executable "avService.exe" is placed in the same directory and also runs under
the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM account.

However the default permissions on the "C:\ProgramData\unifi-video" folder are
inherited from "C:\ProgramData" and are not explicitly overridden, which allows
all users, even unprivileged ones, to append and write files to the application
directory:

c:\ProgramData>icacls unifi-video
unifi-video NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(WD,AD,WEA,WA)

Upon start and stop of the service, it tries to load and execute the file at
"C:\ProgramData\unifi-video\taskkill.exe". However this file does not exist in
the application directory by default at all.

By copying an arbitrary "taskkill.exe" to "C:\ProgramData\unifi-video\" as an
unprivileged user, it is therefore possible to escalate privileges and execute
arbitrary code as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM.

6. RISK
=======
To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must already have access
to a system running a vulnerable installation of UniFi video using a
low-privileged user account (i.e. through a password compromise).

The vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges and execute
arbitrary code as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM, which basically means a complete loss of
the system's confidentiality, integrity as well as availability.

7. SOLUTION
===========
Update to v3.8.0

8. REPORT TIMELINE
==================
2016-05-24: Discovery of the vulnerability
2016-05-24: Reported to vendor via HackerOne (#140793)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

4. INTRODUCTION
===============
UniFi Video is a powerful and flexible, integrated IP video management
surveillance system designed to work with Ubiquiti’s UniFi Video Camera product
line. UniFi Video has an intuitive, configurable, and feature‑packed user
interface with advanced features such as motion detection, auto‑discovery,
user-level security, storage management, reporting, and mobile device support.

the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM account.

all users, even unprivileged ones, to append and write files to the application

Upon start and stop of the service, it tries to load and execute the file at
