Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) module of Huawei USG products.
*   The root cause is insufficient validation of a specific field in EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   Insufficient validation of EAP packet fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable Huawei USG products. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, allowing for a wide variety of malicious activities such as data theft, network manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed remotely.
*   The attacker must be able to control a RADIUS server.
*   The attacker sends crafted EAP packets to the USG device through a RADIUS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to control a RADIUS server that has already completed the authentication process with the target USG product. This implies the attacker has gained some initial access or control over the environment in order to be able to make use of the RADIUS server.
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious EAP packets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory provides a CVSS v2 score:
    *   Base Score: 7.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)
    *   Temporal Score: 5.9 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
*   The advisory lists specific affected product versions and the corresponding fixes.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by an internal Huawei tester.
*   Huawei recommends contacting their TAC for software updates to fix the vulnerability.
