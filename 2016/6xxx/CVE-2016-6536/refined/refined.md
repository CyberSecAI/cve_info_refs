- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the web interface of the AVer Information EH6108H+ hybrid DVR not properly validating user input when accessing the `/setup` page. Specifically, the `handle` parameter can be guessed, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication Bypass (CWE-302) due to reliance on predictable or guessable values for access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can bypass access controls, gain access to restricted pages, modify DVR configurations and change user passwords. This can lead to complete compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access via the web interface of the DVR. The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the `/setup` page with guessed `handle` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the DVR and be able to make HTTP requests to it. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
