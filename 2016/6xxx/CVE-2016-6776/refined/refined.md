Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the NVIDIA GPU driver, specifically within the NVMAP component.
*   It stems from referencing memory after it has been freed (use-after-free).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been released.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.
*   **Local Permanent Device Compromise:** This can lead to a permanent compromise of the device. Recovery from such a compromise may require reflashing the device's operating system.
*   **Denial of service:** The vulnerability may also lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring a malicious application to be present on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** An attacker needs the ability to install and execute a malicious application on the vulnerable device.
*   **Privileged Context:** The vulnerability is exploitable from within a privileged context, where an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates the vulnerability was addressed in the December 2016 Android Security Bulletin.
*   The patch for the vulnerability is not publicly available in source code form; it's distributed within the binary driver updates provided by Google.
*   The vulnerability affects the Nexus 9 device.

**Summary of CVE-2016-6776**

CVE-2016-6776 is a critical use-after-free vulnerability within the NVIDIA GPU driver on the Nexus 9 device. It allows a local malicious application to gain kernel-level code execution, resulting in a potential permanent device compromise or denial of service.
