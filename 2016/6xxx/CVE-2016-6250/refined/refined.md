  "CVE-2016-6250": {
    "Description": "The ISO9660 writer in libarchive is subject to integer overflows when verifying the filename size. This can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow and a crash when writing ISO9660 images with 2GB or 4GB filenames. A specially crafted ISO9660 volume with a large filename, specifically with 2 GB or 4 GB filenames, could cause the application to attempt to allocate 20 GB of memory. If this were to succeed, it could lead to an out-of-bounds write on the heap and potential code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow vulnerabilities due to explicit casts from `size_t` to `int` when handling filename lengths, especially when the size of int is smaller than size_t (e.g., on 64-bit systems). Incorrect offset calculation during record writing, based on these manipulated lengths, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow when casting size_t to int",
      "Incorrect bounds check on file names",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect offset calculations"
    ],
    "Impact": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability may lead to a denial of service (crash) or potentially allow code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting an ISO9660 volume with specially constructed long filenames that triggers the integer overflow. This malicious volume has to be processed by an application that uses the vulnerable libarchive library.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the file names that are written into an iso9660 container by the vulnerable libarchive library. The attacker needs to be able to craft filenames that bypass the initial length checks, which is achieved through a combination of a directory entry and a large filename entry. The vulnerability can be triggered on 64-bit systems where `sizeof(int)` is smaller than `sizeof(size_t)`."
