Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the installation procedure of the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper privilege management during the installation process allows for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain *root*-level privileges on the affected Cisco APIC device. This means the attacker gains complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local access (AV:L). This indicates the attacker must have some form of local access to the vulnerable system.
- The attack requires the attacker to be authenticated (Au:S). The attacker needs to be a valid user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials on the Cisco APIC device.
- The attacker must be able to execute commands locally on the system.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **Base Score: 6.8**
    - AV:L (Local access)
    - AC:L (Low complexity)
    - Au:S (Single authentication)
    - C:C (Complete confidentiality impact)
    - I:C (Complete integrity impact)
    - A:C (Complete availability impact)
- **Temporal Score: 5.6**
    - E:F (Functional exploit exists)
    - RL:OF (Official fix available)
    - RC:C (Confirmed)

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
- A software update from Cisco is required to fix this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by an external security researcher.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
