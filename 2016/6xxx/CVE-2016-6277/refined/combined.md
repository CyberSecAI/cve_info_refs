# Security Advisory for CVE-2016-6277, PSV-2016-0245

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

NETGEAR is aware of the security issue CVE-2016-6277 (formerly designated VU #582384) that allows unauthenticated web pages to pass form input directly to the command-line interface. A remote attacker can potentially inject arbitrary commands which are then executed by the system.

**NETGEAR has completed testing on the latest firmware versions of its entire currently shipping WiFi router portfolio for this vulnerability. To NETGEAR’s knowledge, the models below are the only affected models.**

**NETGEAR has tested the following products and confirmed that they are vulnerable**:

All products now have production firmware fixes available.

* R6250
* R6400
* R6700
* R6900
* R7000
* R7100LG
* R7300DST
* R7900
* R8000
* D6220
* D6400

**The D7000 was previously included in a list of models that were affected by this security vulnerability. However, NETGEAR has tested and confirmed that the D7000 *is not affected* by this command injection vulnerability.**

Production firmware is available for all affected models. Even if you have already downloaded the beta firmware fix for your model, NETGEAR strongly recommends that all users download the production firmware as soon as possible. If you do not upgrade your firmware to the production version, the potential for this command injection vulnerability remains.

To download the production firmware, which fixes the command injection vulnerability, visit the firmware release page for your model and follow the instructions:

* [R6250](https://kb.netgear.com/000036749/R6250-Firmware-Version-1-0-4-8)
* [R6400](https://kb.netgear.com/000036952/R6400-Firmware-Version-1-0-1-20)
* [R6700](https://kb.netgear.com/000036748/R6700-Firmware-Version-1-0-1-16)
* [R6900](https://kb.netgear.com/000036747/R6900-Firmware-Version-1-0-1-16)
* [R7000](https://kb.netgear.com/000037100/R7000-Firmware-Version-1-0-7-10)
* [R7100LG](https://kb.netgear.com/000036545/R7100LG-Firmware-Version-1-0-0-28)
* [R7300DST](https://kb.netgear.com/000036551/R7300-Firmware-Version-1-0-0-46)
* [R7900](https://kb.netgear.com/000036754/R7900-Firmware-Version-1-0-1-12)
* [R8000](https://kb.netgear.com/000036746/R8000-Firmware-Version-1-0-3-32)
* [D6220](https://kb.netgear.com/000036548/D6220-Firmware-Version-1-0-0-22)
* [D6400](https://kb.netgear.com/000036555/D6400-Firmware-Version-1-0-0-56)

NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by upgrading to production firmware as recommended in this notification.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Multiple Netgear routers are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection

#### Vulnerability Note VU#582384

Original Release Date: 2016-12-09 | Last Revised: 2017-01-03

---

### Overview

Netgear R6250, R6400, R6700, R6900, R7000, R7100LG, R7300DST, R7900, R8000, D6220, and D6400 routers and possibly other models are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection.

### Description

| [**CWE-77**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**, [**CWE-306**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, and [**CWE-352**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**  R6250, R6400, R6700, R6900, R7000, R7100LG, R7300, R7900, R8000, D6220, and D6400 contain an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability that may be executed directly or via cross-domain requests. Known affected firmware versions include Netgear R7000 version 1.0.7.2\_1.1.93, R6400 version 1.0.1.12\_1.0.11, and R8000 version 1.0.3.4\_1.1.2. Earlier versions may also be affected. The command injection vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2016-6277.By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted web site, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on affected routers. An unauthenticated, LAN-based attacker may do the same by issuing a direct request, e.g. by visiting:http://<router\_IP>/cgi-bin/;COMMANDAn [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40889/) demonstrating these vulnerabilities has been publicly disclosed.[Netgear's advisory](http://kb.netgear.com/000036386/CVE-2016-582384) indicates that the R6250, R6400, R6700, R6900, R7000, R7100LG, R7300DST, R7900, R8000, D6220, and D6400 are vulnerable, though affected firmware versions are not enumerated. The vendor has indicated in their advisory that all listed models now have firmware updates available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted web site, a remote unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on affected routers. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Netgear has released firmware updates for the affected models specified in their [advisory](http://kb.netgear.com/000036386/CVE-2016-582384). Users are strongly encouraged to update as soon as possible. For users unable or unwilling to apply a firmware fix, we recommend the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Disable web server**The very vulnerabilities that exist on affected routers may be used to temporarily disable the vulnerable web server until the device is restarted:http://<router\_IP>/cgi-bin/;killall$IFS'httpd'Note that after performing this step, your router's web administration not be available until the device is restarted. Please see [Bas' Blog](http://www.sj-vs.net/a-temporary-fix-for-cert-vu582384-cwe-77-on-netgear-r7000-and-r6400-routers/) for more details.**Do not enable remote administration**Enabling remote administration allows affected routers to be exploited via direct requests from the WAN. As such, users are strongly advised to leave remote administration disabled, or disable it if is has been enabled previously. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
