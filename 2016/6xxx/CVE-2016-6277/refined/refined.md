{
  "CVE-2016-6277": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the web interface when passing data to the command-line interface.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection (CWE-77)",
      "Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected routers. This allows the attacker to fully compromise the router and potentially the network it is connected to.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By convincing a user to visit a malicious website (CSRF)",
      "By direct request to a vulnerable URL on the router's web interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. For the direct request, the attacker needs network access to the router (either LAN or WAN if remote administration is enabled). For CSRF, the attacker needs to convince a user to visit a specially crafted webpage.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted URL is sent to the router through the cgi-bin interface. This can be done via CSRF or a direct request if the attacker has network access to the router. The attacker can use the vulnerability to execute any shell command."
