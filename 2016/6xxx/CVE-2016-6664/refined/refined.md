Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-6664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure file handling within the `mysqld_safe` script, which is commonly used to start the MySQL database server. Specifically, the script's logic for creating and managing error log files is flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Attack:** The `mysqld_safe` script creates a new error log file (using `touch`), then changes the owner (`chown`) and permissions (`chmod`). An attacker can replace the error log file with a symbolic link to an arbitrary file on the filesystem which will cause the following operations to be performed on the linked file.
*   **Unsafe File Operations**: By manipulating the error log file or its location, an attacker can redirect the `touch`, `chown`, or `chmod` operations to an arbitrary file on the system, allowing for manipulation of files owned by the mysql user and potentially escalating to root privilege.
*   **Incomplete Fixes:** Initial attempts to fix this vulnerability were racy, allowing a determined attacker to still trigger the vulnerability and bypass checks. It was also still possible to set log-error to point to arbitrary file, bypassing symlinks checks, thus allowing arbitrary file corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  A local user with access to the MySQL system account could exploit the vulnerability to gain root-level privileges.  This is done by changing ownership and mode of arbitrary files owned by mysql to files owned by root and being executable with SUID flags, thus achieving privilege escalation to root.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Once root privileges are obtained, an attacker can fully compromise the target server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, by combining this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities, an attacker may be able to run arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** It may be possible to cause a crash or hang the mysql service by writing to log files via symlinks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector involves local access to the system by a user who has the ability to execute commands as the mysql user.
*   **File-based logging:** The vulnerability relies on file-based logging being enabled (which is default), as opposed to syslog.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the MySQL System Account:** The attacker must be able to execute commands as the mysql user. This could be done via a compromised web application or having credentials to the mysql user.
*   **Ability to Create Databases or Tables (for CVE-2016-5483/CVE-2017-3600):** In this case, an attacker could create specially crafted database/table names, with newline characters, so that mysqldump output can be used to execute arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Knowledge of Error Log Location:** The attacker must know or be able to determine the location of the MySQL error log file.
*   **Modify MySQL Configuration Files** (for CVE-2017-3291): To gain root privileges via the `ledir` option.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is triggered by actions the `mysqld_safe` script takes when a mysqld process needs to be restarted (e.g. after a crash or kill signal), as the loop re-creates the error log file.
* Red Hat mentions the vulnerability could be exploited by "an administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges", which suggests the user may not need local shell access, only the ability to execute commands via MySQL queries.
* The vulnerability was found to be exploitable on various MySQL-based databases: MySQL, MariaDB and PerconaDB.
* Red Hat states "the mysql operating system user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root", highlighting the user needs to have shell access to escalate the privileges.

This detailed analysis should provide a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability and its potential implications.
