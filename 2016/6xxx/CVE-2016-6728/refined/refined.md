{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel ION subsystem.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A local malicious application could exploit the vulnerability in the kernel ION subsystem to gain elevated privileges.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel, potentially leading to a local permanent device compromise which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local malicious application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device."
