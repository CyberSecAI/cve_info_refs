  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication in the .NET remoting services. Although encryption is used, the encryption key is negotiated without authentication allowing any attacker to invoke remote methods. The disclosed advisory and exploit code were released after attempts to notify BMC were unsuccessful. The vulnerability is present in version 11.4 and earlier, with older versions being affected by a very similar vulnerability under CVE-2014-4872.",
    "remediation": "Upgrade to BMC Track-It! 11.5 or above."
