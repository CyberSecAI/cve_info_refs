Happy new year!

I was doing some new year cleaning and realised I never released this
advisory properly. Two vulnerabilities in BMC Track-It! 11.4 which were
disclosed by SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure on July 2016.

Posting here because I've seen quite a few of these still in active use,
live and deployed in corporate networks.
The exploit is available in my repo at [3]. It's also interesting to see
how they completely ignored my advice, but I'm used to that. Here it is
in full glory for your reading pleasure.

This advisory and exploit can also be fetched at my github repo
(<https://github.com/pedrib/PoC>) and in the SSD blog at
<https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2713>. A big thanks to
SecuriTeam for helping out as always.

Disclosure: 04/07/2016 / Last updated: 01/01/2017

```

```
BMC Track-It! exposes several .NET remoting services on port 9010. .NET
remoting is a remote method technology similar to Java RMI or CORBA
which allows you to invoke methods remotely and retrieve their result.

These remote methods are used when a technician uses the Track-It!
client console to communicate with the central Track-It! server. A
technician would invoke these methods for obtaining tickets, creating a
new ticket, uploading files to tickets, etc.

On October 2014, two 0 day vulnerabilities for Track-It! 11.3 were
disclosed (under CVE-2014-4872, see [1]). The vulnerabilities were due
to the Track-It! server accepting remote method invocations without any
kind of authentication or encryption. The vulnerabilities were very
severe: one allowed an attacker to execute code on the server as NETWORK
SERVICE or SYSTEM, while the other would allow an attacker to obtain the
domain administrator and SQL server passwords if the Track-It! server
had password reset turned on.

These vulnerabilities were discovered in a trivial manner - simply by
turning Wireshark on and observing the packets one could see the remote
method invocations and objects being passed around. Duplicate and even
triplicate packets would not be rejected by the server, which would
execute whatever action was requested in the packet.

Disclosure was done by the US-CERT, which attempted to contact BMC but
received no response after 45 days. After this period they released the
vulnerability information and I released two Metasploit exploits.

BMC contacted me asking for advice on how to fix the issues, to which I
responded:
"For #1 [file upload] and #2 [domain admin pass disclosure] the fix is
to implement authentication and authorisation. There is no other way to
fix it.
[...] Make sure the auth is done properly. You will have to negotiate
some kind of session key using the user's credential at the start and
use that session key for encryption going forward. Do not use a fixed
key, as this can be reverse engineered.
If you don't implement such mechanism, it's just a question of time
before someone else breaks your protection and finds new vulnerabilities."

On December 9th 2014, BMC released Track-It! 11.4 [2], which they
claimed had fixed the security vulnerabilities.

At first glance, this seemed to be true. Traffic in Wireshark did seem
to be encrypted. However upon further inspection, it became obvious that
while the actual method invocation and its arguments were being
encrypted using a DES key, there was still no authentication being done.
What this means in practice is that anyone can negotiate a new
encryption key with the server and use that from then on to invoke
remote methods without ever authenticating to the server, even for the
initial encryption key exchange.

The code can be inspected by decompiling TrackIt.Utility.Common.dll. The
interesting part is in:
namespace TrackIt.Utility.Common.Remoting
{
    internal enum SecureTransaction
    {
        Uninitialized,
        SendingPublicKey,
        SendingSharedKey,
        SendingEncryptedMessage,
        SendingEncryptedResult,
        UnknownIdentifier,
        UnauthenticatedClient
    }
}
This represents the state machine that the server uses to track client
requests. The initial state is UnauthenticatedClient for any unknown
client. A typical communication would be as follows:
1- Client generates a RSA key, which it shares with the server by
sending a Modulus and an Exponent.
2- Server creates a DES key and sends that key back to the client
3- Client and server now share an encryption key; that key is used to
pass back messages back and forth (states SendingEncryptedMessage and
SendingEncryptedResult).

As it is evident, at no point there is any authentication or credentials
being passed from the client to the server. So while all traffic is
encrypted, anyone can negotiate an encryption key with the server and
invoke any remote method.

```
> ```
> From here on, building an exploit is trivial. All that is needed is to
>
> ```

```
import the library DLL's from the Track-It! client application and
invoke the methods in the code.

A special thanks to SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure (SSD), which have
assisted me in disclosing this vulnerability to BMC. Their advisory can
be found at <https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2713>.

Exploit code for this vulnerability has been released, and can be found
in the same github repository as this advisory [3].

```
#1
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload
CVE-2016-6598
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected versions: 11.4 (versions <= 11.3 are affected by CVE-2014-4872,
which is very similar)

The application exposes an unauthenticated .NET remoting file storage
service (FileStorageService) on port 9010.
This service contains a method that allows uploading a file to an
arbitrary path on the machine that is running Track-It!. This can be
used to upload a file to the web root and achieve code execution as
NETWORK SERVICE or SYSTEM.

#2
Vulnerability: Domain administrator and SQL server user credentials
disclosure
CVE-2016-6599
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected versions: 11.4 (versions <= 11.3 are affected by CVE-2014-4872,
which is very similar)

The application exposes an unauthenticated .NET remoting configuration
service (ConfigurationService) on port 9010.
This service contains a method that can be used to retrieve a
configuration file that contains the application database name, username
and password as well as the domain administrator username and password.
These are encrypted with a fixed key and IV ("NumaraIT") using the DES
algorithm. The domain administrator username and password can only be
obtained if the Self-Service component is enabled, which is the most
common scenario in enterprise deployments.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

>> Background and summaryBMC Track-It! exposes several .NET remoting services on port 9010. .NET remoting is a remote method technology similar to Java RMI or CORBA which allows you to invoke methods remotely and retrieve their result.
These remote methods are used when a technician uses the Track-It! client console to communicate with the central Track-It! server. A technician would invoke these methods for obtaining tickets, creating a new ticket, uploading files to tickets, etc.
On October 2014, two 0 day vulnerabilities for Track-It! 11.3 were disclosed (under CVE-2014-4872, see [1]). The vulnerabilities were dueto the Track-It! server accepting remote method invocations without any kind of authentication or encryption. The vulnerabilities were very severe: one allowed an attacker to execute code on the server as NETWORK SERVICE or SYSTEM, while the other would allow an attacker to obtain the domain administrator and SQL server passwords if the Track-It! server had password reset turned on.
These vulnerabilities were discovered in a trivial manner - simply by turning Wireshark on and observing the packets one could see the remote method invocations and objects being passed around. Duplicate and even triplicate packets would not be rejected by the server, which would execute whatever action was requested in the packet.
Disclosure was done by the US-CERT, which attempted to contact BMC but received no response after 45 days. After this period they released the vulnerability information and I released two Metasploit exploits.
BMC contacted me asking for advice on how to fix the issues, to which I responded:"For #1 [file upload] and #2 [domain admin pass disclosure] the fix is to implement authentication and authorisation. There is no other way to fix it.[...] Make sure the auth is done properly. You will have to negotiate some kind of session key using the user's credential at the start and use that session key for encryption going forward. Do not use a fixed key, as this can be reverse engineered.If you don't implement such mechanism, it's just a question of time before someone else breaks your protection and finds new vulnerabilities."
On December 9th 2014, BMC released Track-It! 11.4 [2], which they claimed had fixed the security vulnerabilities.
At first glance, this seemed to be true. Traffic in Wireshark did seem to be encrypted. However upon further inspection, it became obvious that while the actual method invocation and its arguments were being encrypted using a DES key, there was still no authentication being done.What this means in practice is that anyone can negotiate a new encryption key with the server and use that from then on to invoke remote methods without ever authenticating to the server, even for the initial encryption key exchange.
The code can be inspected by decompiling TrackIt.Utility.Common.dll. The interesting part is in:namespace TrackIt.Utility.Common.Remoting{ internal enum SecureTransaction { Uninitialized, SendingPublicKey, SendingSharedKey, SendingEncryptedMessage, SendingEncryptedResult, UnknownIdentifier, UnauthenticatedClient }}This represents the state machine that the server uses to track client requests. The initial state is UnauthenticatedClient for any unknown client. A typical communication would be as follows:1- Client generates a RSA key, which it shares with the server by sending a Modulus and an Exponent.2- Server creates a DES key and sends that key back to the client3- Client and server now share an encryption key; that key is used to pass back messages back and forth (states SendingEncryptedMessage and SendingEncryptedResult).
As it is evident, at no point there is any authentication or credentials being passed from the client to the server. So while all traffic is encrypted, anyone can negotiate an encryption key with the server and invoke any remote method.
From here on, building an exploit is trivial. All that is needed is to import the library DLL's from the Track-It! client application and invoke the methods in the code.
A special thanks to SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure (SSD), which have assisted me in disclosing this vulnerability to BMC. Their advisory can be found at https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2713.
Exploit code for this vulnerability has been released, and can be found in the same github repository as this advisory [3].
>> Technical details:#1Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file uploadCVE-2016-6598Attack Vector: RemoteConstraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attackerAffected versions: 11.4 (versions <= 11.3 are affected by CVE-2014-4872, which is very similar)
The application exposes an unauthenticated .NET remoting file storage service (FileStorageService) on port 9010. This service contains a method that allows uploading a file to an arbitrary path on the machine that is running Track-It!. This can be used to upload a file to the web root and achieve code execution as NETWORK SERVICE or SYSTEM.
#2Vulnerability: Domain administrator and SQL server user credentials disclosureCVE-2016-6599Attack Vector: RemoteConstraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attackerAffected versions: 11.4 (versions <= 11.3 are affected by CVE-2014-4872, which is very similar)
The application exposes an unauthenticated .NET remoting configuration service (ConfigurationService) on port 9010. This service contains a method that can be used to retrieve a configuration file that contains the application database name, username and password as well as the domain administrator username and password. These are encrypted with a fixed key and IV ("NumaraIT") using the DES algorithm. The domain administrator username and password can only be obtained if the Self-Service component is enabled, which is the most common scenario in enterprise deployments.
>> Fix:Upgrade to BMC Track-It! 11.5 or above.
