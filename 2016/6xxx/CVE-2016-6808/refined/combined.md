Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2016-6808 Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector buffer
 overflow

CVE-2016-6808 Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector buffer overflow

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.41

Description
The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual
host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to
create a virtual host mapping rule. The length checks prior to writing
to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of
the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.
It is not known if this overflow is exploitable.

Mitigation
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.42
- Where available, use IIS configuration to restrict the maximum URI
  length to 4095 - (the length of the longest virtual host name)

Credit:
This issue was discovered by The Apache Tomcat Security Team.

# Nmap Network Scanning

[![Cover of Nmap Network Scanning](https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20)

*Nmap Network Scanning* is
the official guide to the [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/),
a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits
all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Nmap's original author, Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development. It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
([screenshot](https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).
The book is in English, though [several translations](#translations) are in the works.

Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., £34.95 in
the U.K., and €39.95 in Europe. Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see [purchasing
options](#purchase)). It is 468 pages long. The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

About half of the content is [available in the
free online edition](toc.html). Chapters exclusive to the print edition
include “Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems”, “Optimizing Nmap Performance”,
“Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms”, “Host
Discovery (Ping Scanning)”, and more.
The *solution* selections which provide detailed
instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also
exclusive to the printed book. The
[final table of contents](toc.pdf) and [cover art](cover/) are available.

## Updates

Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/). The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate. But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished. The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76. So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the [Nmap changelog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html) and search
in the file for “Nmap 4.76”. Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
## Translations

We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets. If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please let me know. Here are the current or in-progress translations:

* [![Cover of 'Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern'](xlate/nmap-opensourcepress-de-cover-95x125.jpg)](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270)
  [Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270) is the German translation by Open Source Press, released in June 2009 at a list price of €39.90. Translation was performed expertly by Dinu Gherman. They have contributed back their [Nmap Reference Guide German translation](/man/de/).* [![Cover of 'Exame de Redes com NMAP'](xlate/nmap-ciencia-moderna-cover-95x125.jpg)](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778)
    [Exame de Redes com NMAP](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) is the Brazilian Portuguese translation by Editora Ciência Moderna. Translation was done by [Angico](http://www.angico.org) and release was August 26, 2009. You can [buy it directly from the publisher](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) for R$95.20.* [![Cover of '엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝'](xlate/nmap-acornpub-ko-cover-95x125.png)](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap)
      The official Korean translation, entitled [엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap), has been created by [Acorn Publishing Co](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/). The release date was November 16, 2009 at a list price of KRW 35,000.

## Current status

**August 26:** Many Barnes & Noble stores now stock NNS, as described in the [purchasing section](#purchase).

**August 26:** Editora Ciência Moderna released the Brazilian Portuguese translation. See [translations](#translations).

**July 31:** Held a [book signing](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0426.html) at Defcon. All copies sold out in 3 hours.

**July 16:** [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/) released!

**June 11:** The German translation from Open Source Press is [now available](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270). They also contributed back a [German translation of the Nmap Reference Guide.](/man/de/)

**January 30:** Today the Amazon price is back to $32.97 after several days at $37.96. I hope they keep it at this price!

**January 23:** Amazon has raised their prices, so I've added [more purchase options](#purchase), though the cheapest is still only about $4.50 less than Amazon when domestic shipping is taken into account.

**January 21:** NNS receives a [glowing review](http://netsecurity.about.com/od/14/gr/NMapBook.htm) from About.Com.

**January 19:** Translation contracts have been signed for Korean and Brazilian Portuguese editions of Nmap Network Scanning! See the new [Translations](#translations) section for details.

**January 5:** [Acorn Publishing Co.](http://www.acornpub.co.kr) will be publishing the official Korean translation of Nmap Network Scanning! Release is expected in August.

**January 4:** NNS is finally in stock at [Amazon U.K.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0979958717) and [Amazon Germany](http://www.amazon.de/dp/0979958717). Amazon Canada currently still has a [1-3 week backlog](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0979958717).

**December 31, 2008:** NNS makes Richard Bejtlich's TaoSecurity [Top Books of 2008](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html) list.

**December 29, 2008:** A new [Information Week review](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/12/nmap_network_sc.html) is one of the best so far!

**December 19, 2008:** The book is [back in stock on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) after a 10 day dry spell!

**December 10, 2008:** Amazon has now indexed this book as part of
their “Search Inside” program. While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them. You can try this out by visiting
the [Amazon
NNS page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20), scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

**December 9, 2008:** Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany. They say it may take a week or more to ship. Amazon still offers a great price, but for those who can't wait, I've added a [purchasing options](#purchase) section. It includes vendor such as A1Books and Barnes & Noble with NNS in stock now.

**December 9, 2008:** Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on [Amazon's computer book best seller list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20)! Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a [screenshot](img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png) ([larger version](img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).

**December 8, 2008:**
An [excellent
Slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml) causes NNS to rocket into [Amazon's top 10 computer books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20).

**December 6, 2008:** Amazon has [fixed the price](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95. NNS is **in stock and shipping**!

**December 2, 2008:** The book has [an initial page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20). You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95. I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two. Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait. Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping. That may or may not be true.

**November 14, 2008:** The book is finished and submitted to the
printer! The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December. To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic [nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce).

**September 15, 2008:** The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success! All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference. Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales. My
conference presentation video and audio have
been [posted
online](http://insecure.org/presentations/) just in time for
the [Nmap
4.75 release](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html) which includes the new features discussed in that
presentation.

**July 25, 2008**: Defcon Pre-Release announced! We have decided to
launch the book with a limited pre-release version at Defcon 16.

**July 1, 2008**: After years of work, Nmap Network Scanning is nearing completion. You can browse the [current table of contents](toc.pdf) to see what is coming. We recently conducted a test-printing of some prepublication copies:

[![Prepublication test-print of Nmap Network Scanning](images/nns-preprint3-750w.jpg)](images/nns-preprint3-1224x1466.jpg)

### Apache Tomcat JK Connectors vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat Jk Connectors. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat® security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat JK
Connectors the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been
verified list the version with a question mark.

This page has been created from a review of the Apache Tomcat archives
and the CVE list. Please send comments or corrections for these
vulnerabilities to the [Tomcat
Security Team](security.html).

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.50

**Moderate: Information disclosure / Denial of service**
[CVE-2024-46544](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-46544)

Incorrect default permissions for the memory mapped file configured by
the `JkShmFile` directive on Unix like systems allows local
users to view and/or modify the contents of the shared memory containing
mod\_jk configuration and status information. This could result in
information disclosure and/or denial of service.

This was fixed with commit
[d55706e9](https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors/commit/d55706e92b65018c2e4c7ab14014a996b0174966).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat Security Team on 6 August 2024.
The issue was made public on 23 September 2024.

Affects: JK 1.2.9-1.2.49 (mod\_jk on Unix like platforms only)

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.49

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2023-41081](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41081)

In some circumstances, such as when a configuration included
`JkOptions +ForwardDirectories` but the configuration did not
provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod\_jk would
use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker.
Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the
status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As
of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all
mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod\_jk is affected
by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

This was fixed with commit
[0095b6cb](https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors/commit/0095b6cb84f41313ee4c0364b49c766168790792).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 7 July 2023. The
issue was made public on 13 September 2023.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.48 (mod\_jk only)

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.46

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.45
but the release vote for the 1.2.45 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 1.2.46 to obtain a version that
includes the fix for this issue, version 1.2.45 is not included in the
list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2018-11759](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11759)

The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested
path before matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle some edge
cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were
exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed
request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy
that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the
reverse proxy. It was also possible in some configurations for a
specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in
httpd. While there is some overlap between this issue and CVE-2018-1323,
they are not identical.

This was fixed in revisions [1838836](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1838836),
[1838857](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1838857),

[1841463](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1841463).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.44

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.43

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2018-1323](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1323)

The IIS/ISAPI specific code that normalised the requested path before
matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle some edge cases
correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed
via IIS, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to
expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not
intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.

This was fixed in [revision 1825658](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1825658).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.42

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.42

**Moderate: Buffer Overflow**
[CVE-2016-6808](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6808)

The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual
host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to
create a virtual host mapping rule. The length checks prior to writing
to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of
the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.

It is not known if this overflow is exploitable.

This was fixed in [revision 1762057](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1762057).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.41

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.41

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-8111](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8111)

Multiple adjacent slashes in a request URI were not collapsed to a single
slash before comparing the request URI to the configured mount and
unmount patterns. It is therefore possible for an attacker to use a
request URI containing multiple adjacent slashes to bypass the
restrictions of a `JkUnmount` directive. This may expose
application functionality through the reverse proxy that is not intended
for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.

As of mod\_jk 1.2.41, slashes are collapsed by default. The behaviour is
now configurable via a new `JkOption` for httpd (values
`CollapseSlashesAll`, `CollapseSlashesNone` or
`CollapseSlashesUnmount`) and via a new property
`collapse_slashes` for IIS (values `all`,
`none`, `unmount`).

This was fixed in [revision 1647017](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1647017).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.40

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.27

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-5519](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5519)

Situations where faulty clients set Content-Length without providing
data, or where a user submits repeated requests very quickly, may permit
one user to view the response associated with a different user's request.

This was fixed in [revision 702540](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=702540).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.26

Source shipped with Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.27

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.23

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2007-1860](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1860)

The issue is related to
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450), the patch for which was insufficient.

When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat)
process a request, the request URL should not get decoded multiple times
in an iterative way by these components. Otherwise it might be possible
to pass access control rules implemented on front of the last component
by applying multiple URL encoding to the request.

mod\_jk before version 1.2.23 by default decoded request URLs inside Apache
httpd and forwarded the encoded URL to Tomcat, which itself did a second
decoding. This made it possible to pass a prefix JkMount for /someapp,
but actually access /otherapp on Tomcat. Starting with version 1.2.23
by default mod\_jk forwards the original unchanged request URL to Tomcat.
You can achieve the same level of security for older versions by setting
the forwarding option "JkOption ForwardURICompatUnparsed".

Please note, that your configuration might contain a different forwarding
JkOption. In this case, please consult the
[forwarding documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/apache.html#Forwarding) concerning the security implications.
The new default setting is more secure than before, but it breaks
interoperability with mod\_rewrite.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.22 (httpd mod\_jk module only)

Source shipped with Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.23

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.21

**Critical: Arbitrary code execution and denial of service**
[CVE-2007-0774](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0774)

An unsafe memory copy in the URI handler for the native JK connector
could result in a stack overflow condition which could be leveraged to
execute arbitrary code or crash the web server.

Affects: JK 1.2.19-1.2.20

Source shipped with: Tomcat 4.1.34, 5.5.20

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.16

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2006-7197](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7197)

The Tomcat AJP connector contained a bug that sometimes set a too long
length for the chunks delivered by send\_body\_chunks AJP messages. Bugs of
this type can cause mod\_jk to read beyond buffer boundaries and thus
reveal sensitive memory information to a client.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.15

Source shipped with: Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.32, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.16

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release adds the new Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 packages that are part of the JBoss Core Services offering.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.6, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for creating a virtual host mapping rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow. (CVE-2016-6808)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)
* An error was found in protocol parsing logic of mod\_cluster load balancer Apache HTTP Server modules. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process. (CVE-2016-8612)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Bock, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes
described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library
must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

# [SECURITY] CVE-2016-6808 Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector buffer overflow

*From*: Mark Thomas <markt () apache org>

*Date*: Thu, 6 Oct 2016 11:41:56 +0100

CVE-2016-6808 Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector buffer overflow

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.41

Description
The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual
host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to
create a virtual host mapping rule. The length checks prior to writing
to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of
the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.
It is not known if this overflow is exploitable.

Mitigation
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.42
- Where available, use IIS configuration to restrict the maximum URI
  length to 4095 - (the length of the longest virtual host name)

Credit:
This issue was discovered by The Apache Tomcat Security Team.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0194)

## Topic

An update is now available for JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release adds the new Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 packages that are part of the JBoss Core Services offering.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.6 and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for creating a virtual host mapping rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow. (CVE-2016-6808)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)
* An error was found in protocol parsing logic of mod\_cluster load balancer Apache HTTP Server modules. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process. (CVE-2016-8612)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Bock, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1387605#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-21 11:14:29 UTC  ```  There is an error in protocol parsing logic of mod_cluster load balancer Apache HTTP Server modules that allows attacker to cause a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process. The vector is mod_cluster service messages that are used by worker nodes to communicate their status, load and deployed applications to the mod_cluster balancer. With proper production configuration, the VirtualHost accepting these messages is accessible only from an internal network where worker nodes reside. The error cannot be exploited from the Internet by arbitrary clients.  Upstream bug:  <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBCS-193>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1387605#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-15 22:12:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2016:2957 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1387605#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-25 20:06:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:0194 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0194](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0194)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1387605#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-25 20:08:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:0193 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0193](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0193)   ``` |  |

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1382352#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-10-06 12:59:01 UTC  ``` The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to create a virtual host mapping rule. It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.  Upstream patch:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1762057>  External References:  <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-jk.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_JK_Connector_1.2.42>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1382352#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-15 22:12:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2016:2957 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1382352#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-25 20:06:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:0194 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0194](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0194)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1382352#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-25 20:07:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:0193 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0193](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0193)   ``` |  |
