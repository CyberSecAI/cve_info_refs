{
  "cveId": "CVE-2016-6808",
  "vulnerability": {
    "summary": "The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to create a virtual host mapping rule. The length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.",
    "details": "The IIS/ISAPI specific code in the Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector concatenates the virtual host name and URI to create a mapping rule. Length checks before writing to a buffer didn't account for the virtual host name's length, leading to a potential buffer overflow. It's unknown if this overflow is exploitable, but it could cause a denial of service or lead to other unintended consequences.",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector versions 1.2.0 to 1.2.41"
    ],
    "rootCause": "Insufficient length validation when concatenating the virtual host name and the URI within the IIS/ISAPI specific code.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
    "impact": "Potential buffer overflow, may cause denial of service or other unintended consequences.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Crafted requests with long virtual host name and URI"
    ],
   "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.",
    "remediation": "Upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.42 or restrict maximum URI length in IIS configuration to 4095 minus the length of the longest virtual host name."
