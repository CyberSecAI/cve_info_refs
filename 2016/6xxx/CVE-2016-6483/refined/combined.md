=============================================
I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
vBulletin <= 5.2.2 Preauth Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
vBulletin <= 4.2.3
vBulletin <= 3.8.9
II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
vBulletin (vB) is a proprietary Internet forum software package developed by
vBulletin Solutions, Inc., a division of Internet Brands.
https://www.vbulletin.com/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBulletin
A google search for "Powered by vBulletin" returns over 19 million sites
that are hosting a vBulletin forum:
https://www.google.co.uk/?gws\_rd=ssl#q=%22Powered+by+vBulletin%22
III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
vBulletin forum software is affected by a SSRF vulnerability that allows
unauthenticated remote attackers to access internal services (such as mail
servers, memcached, couchDB, zabbix etc.) running on the server hosting
vBulletin as well as services on other servers on the local network that are
accessible from the target.
This advisory provides a PoC exploit that demonstrates how an unauthenticated
attacker could perform a port scan of the internal services as well as execute
arbitrary system commands on a target vBulletin host with a locally installed
Zabbix Agent monitoring service.
IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
vBulletin allows forum users to share media fiels by uploading them to the
remote server. Some pages allow users to specify a URL to a media file
that a user wants to share which will then be retrieved by vBulletin.
The user-provided links are validated to make sure that users can only access
resources from HTTP/HTTPS protocols and that connections are not allowed in to
the localhost.
These restrictions can be found in core/vb/vurl/curl.php source file:
/\*\*
\* Determine if the url is safe to load
\*
\* @param $urlinfo -- The parsed url info from vB\_String::parseUrl -- scheme, port, host
\* @return boolean
\*/
private function validateUrl($urlinfo)
{
// VBV-11823, only allow http/https schemes
if (!isset($urlinfo['scheme']) OR !in\_array(strtolower($urlinfo['scheme']), array('http', 'https')))
{
return false;
}
// VBV-11823, do not allow localhost and 127.0.0.0/8 range by default
if (!isset($urlinfo['host']) OR preg\_match('#localhost|127\.(\d)+\.(\d)+\.(\d)+#i', $urlinfo['host']))
{
return false;
}
if (empty($urlinfo['port']))
{
if ($urlinfo['scheme'] == 'https')
{
$urlinfo['port'] = 443;
}
else
{
$urlinfo['port'] = 80;
}
}
// VBV-11823, restrict detination ports to 80 and 443 by default
// allow the admin to override the allowed ports in config.php (in case they have a proxy server they need to go to).
$config = vB::getConfig();
[...]
HTTP redirects are also prohibited however there is one place in the vBulletin
codebase that accepts redirects from the target server specified in a
user-provided link.
The code is used to upload media files within a logged-in user's profile and
can normally be accessed under a path similar to:
http://forum/vBulletin522/member/1-mike/media
By specifying a link to a malicious server that returns a 301 HTTP redirect to
the URL of http://localhost:3306 for example, an attacker could easily
bypass the restrictions presented above and make a connection to mysql/3306
service listening on the localhost.
This introduces a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
As curl is used to fetch remote resources, in addition to HTTP, attackers could
specify a handful of other protocols to interact with local services.
For instance, by sending a redirect to gopher://localhost:11211/datahere
attackers could send arbitrary traffic to memcached service on 11211 port.
Additionally, depending on the temporary directory location configured within
the forum, attackers could potentially view the service responses as the
download function stores responses within temporary files which could be
viewed if the temporary directory is exposed on the web server.
V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
-------------------------
The exploit code below performs a port scan as well as demonstrates remote
command execution via a popular Zabbix Agent monitoring service which might be
listening on local port of 10050.
The exploit will execute a reverse bash shell on the target if it has the agent
installed and permits remote commands.
The exploit was verified on the following zabbix agent configuration
(/etc/zabbix/zabbix\_agentd.conf):
Server=127.0.0.1,::1
EnableRemoteCommands=1

vBulletin <= 5.2.2 SSRF PoC Exploit (portscan / zabbix agent RCE)
This PoC exploits an SSRF vulnerability in vBulletin to scan internal services

After the scan, the exploit also checks for a Zabbix Agent (10050) port and
gives an option to execute a reverse shell (Remote Commands) that will connect
back to the attacker's host on port 8080 by default.

usage = """
Usage:
The exploit requires that you have an external IP and can start a listener on port 80/443
on the attacking machine.
./vBulletin\_SSRF\_exploit.py our\_external\_IP vBulletin\_base\_url [minimum\_port] [maximum\_port]
Example invocation that starts listener on 192.168.1.40 (port 80) and scans local ports 1-85
on the remote vBulletin target host:
./vBulletin\_SSRF\_exploit.py 192.168.1.40 http://vbulletin-target/forum 1 85
Before exploiting Zabbix Agent, start your netcat listener on 8080 port in a separate shell e.g:
nc -vv -l -p 8080
Disclaimer:
For testing purposes only. Do no harm.
SSL/TLS support needs some tuning. For better results, provide HTTP URL to the vBulletin target.

vBulletin  <= 5.2.2      Preauth Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
vBulletin  <= 4.2.3
vBulletin  <= 3.8.9

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

vBulletin (vB) is a proprietary Internet forum software package developed by
vBulletin Solutions, Inc., a division of Internet Brands.

https://www.vbulletin.com/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBulletin

A google search for "Powered by vBulletin" returns over 19 million sites
that are hosting a vBulletin forum:

https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=%22Powered+by+vBulletin%22

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

vBulletin forum software is affected by a SSRF vulnerability that allows
unauthenticated remote attackers to access internal services (such as mail
servers, memcached, couchDB, zabbix etc.) running on the server hosting
vBulletin as well as services on other servers on the local network that are
accessible from the target.

This advisory provides a PoC exploit that demonstrates how an unauthenticated
attacker could perform a port scan of the internal services as well as execute
arbitrary system commands on a target vBulletin host with a locally installed
Zabbix Agent monitoring service.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

vBulletin allows forum users to share media fiels by uploading them to the
remote server. Some pages allow users to specify a URL to a media file
that a user wants to share which will then be retrieved by vBulletin.
The user-provided links are validated to make sure that users can only access
resources from HTTP/HTTPS protocols and that connections are not allowed in to
the localhost.

These restrictions can be found in core/vb/vurl/curl.php source file:

/**
 *      Determine if the url is safe to load
 *
 *      @param $urlinfo -- The parsed url info from vB_String::parseUrl -- scheme, port, host
 *      @return boolean
 */
private function validateUrl($urlinfo)
{
	// VBV-11823, only allow http/https schemes
	if (!isset($urlinfo['scheme']) OR !in_array(strtolower($urlinfo['scheme']), array('http', 'https')))
	{
		return false;
	}

	// VBV-11823, do not allow localhost and 127.0.0.0/8 range by default
	if (!isset($urlinfo['host']) OR preg_match('#localhost|127\.(\d)+\.(\d)+\.(\d)+#i', $urlinfo['host']))
	{
		return false;
	}

	if (empty($urlinfo['port']))
	{
		if ($urlinfo['scheme'] == 'https')
		{
			$urlinfo['port'] = 443;
		}
		else
		{
			$urlinfo['port'] = 80;
		}
	}
       // VBV-11823, restrict detination ports to 80 and 443 by default
	// allow the admin to override the allowed ports in config.php (in case they have a proxy server they need to go to).
	$config = vB::getConfig();
[...]

HTTP redirects are also prohibited however there is one place in the vBulletin
codebase that accepts redirects from the target server specified in a
user-provided link.
The code is used to upload media files within a logged-in user's profile and
can normally be accessed under a path similar to:

http://forum/vBulletin522/member/1-mike/media

By specifying a link to a malicious server that returns a 301 HTTP redirect to
the URL of http://localhost:3306 for example, an attacker could easily
bypass the restrictions presented above and make a connection to mysql/3306
service listening on the localhost.

This introduces a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

As curl is used to fetch remote resources, in addition to HTTP, attackers could
specify a handful of other protocols to interact with local services.
For instance, by sending a redirect to  gopher://localhost:11211/datahere
attackers could send arbitrary traffic to memcached service on 11211 port.

Additionally, depending on the temporary directory location configured within
the forum, attackers could potentially view the service responses as the
download function stores responses within temporary files which could be
viewed if the temporary directory is exposed on the web server.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
-------------------------

The exploit code below performs a port scan as well as demonstrates remote
command execution via a popular Zabbix Agent monitoring service which might be
listening on local port of 10050.
The exploit will execute a reverse bash shell on the target if it has the agent
installed and permits remote commands.

The exploit was verified on the following zabbix agent configuration
(/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf):

Server=127.0.0.1,::1
EnableRemoteCommands=1

This PoC exploits an SSRF vulnerability in vBulletin to scan internal services
installed on the web server that is hosting the vBulletin forum.

After the scan, the exploit also checks for a Zabbix Agent (10050) port and
gives an option to execute a reverse shell (Remote Commands) that will connect
back to the attacker's host on port 8080 by default.

Coded by:

"""
usage = """
Usage:
The exploit requires that you have an external IP and can start a listener on port 80/443
on the attacking machine.

./vBulletin_SSRF_exploit.py our_external_IP vBulletin_base_url [minimum_port] [maximum_port]

Example invocation that starts listener on 192.168.1.40 (port 80) and scans local ports 1-85
on the remote vBulletin target host:

./vBulletin_SSRF_exploit.py 192.168.1.40 http://vbulletin-target/forum 1 85

Before exploiting Zabbix Agent, start your netcat listener on 8080 port in a separate shell e.g:

nc -vv -l -p 8080

Disclaimer:
For testing purposes only. Do no harm.

SSL/TLS support needs some tuning. For better results, provide HTTP URL to the vBulletin target.

Job done. Exiting

Here is how the netcat session looks like after a sucessful exploitation:

$ nc -vvv -l -p 8080

As we can see reverse shell was executed on the target which sucessfully
connected back to the attacker's netcat listener.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

  ## Security Patch - vBulletin 5.2.0, 5.2.1, 5.2.2

  Mon 1 Aug '16, 5:17pm

  A potential security issue has been reported to the vBulletin team. This issue could allow remote content to compromise your system. To fix this issue, we have created a new security patch.

  You can download the patch for your version here: <http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php>

  To install the patch:

  1) Download the appropriate files for your version of vBulletin 5

  2) Upload all files found within the zip file. Make sure to overwrite the existing files on your server.

  If you are using a version of vBulletin 5 Connect prior to 5.2.1, you are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to protect your content.

  vBulletin Cloud sites have already had this fix applied.

  Patches:

  5.2.2 Patch Level 1

  5.2.1 Patch Level 1

  5.2.0 Patch Level 3

  This issue has been resolved in 5.2.3 Release Candidate 3. Customers using a pre-release copy of 5.2.3 are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.

  ## Security Patch - vBulletin 3.8.7, 3.8.8, 3.8.9, 3.8.10 Beta

  Mon 1 Aug '16, 5:14pm

  A security issue has been reported to the vBulletin team. Potentially, this issue could allow attachment uploads to exploit your system. This issue has been resolved.

  You can download the patch for your version here: <http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php>

  To install the patch:

  1) Download the appropriate files for your version of vBulletin 3

  2) Upload all files found within the zip file. Make sure to overwrite the existing files on your server.

  This should not affect your modified settings.

  If you're using version 3.8.6 or before, then you should upgrade to your installation of vBulletin to 3.8.9.

  In addition to the patches, a new version of vBulletin 3.8.10 Beta is also available. Please perform a regular upgrade if you are using the beta.

  Patches:

  3.8.9 Patch Level 1

  3.8.8 Patch Level 2

  3.8.7 Patch Level 6
