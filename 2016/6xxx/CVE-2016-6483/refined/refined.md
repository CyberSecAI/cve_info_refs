Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from vBulletin's improper handling of HTTP redirects when fetching remote media files. Specifically, while the software attempts to restrict URLs to HTTP/HTTPS protocols and block connections to localhost, it fails to prevent redirects to internal services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core issue is that an attacker can use a malicious server to redirect vBulletin's requests to internal services by exploiting the media upload functionality that accepts redirects.
*   **Bypass of URL restrictions:** The URL validation in `core/vb/vurl/curl.php` can be bypassed using a 301 HTTP redirect. This allows access to restricted resources (e.g., localhost, internal network).
*   **Lack of redirect validation:** The vulnerability arises because the application does not validate redirects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to internal services:** Attackers can access services running on the same server as vBulletin (e.g., MySQL, memcached, Zabbix, etc.) or on the local network.
*   **Port scanning:** Attackers can perform a port scan of the internal network by attempting connections to different ports.
*   **Arbitrary command execution:** By redirecting to a gopher URL, it is possible to send arbitrary commands to services such as memcached.  Also, if the Zabbix agent is installed and remote commands are enabled, the attacker can execute system commands via the Zabbix agent.
*   **Information disclosure:** Depending on the location of the temporary directory configured in vBulletin, responses from internal services might be viewable if that directory is exposed on the web server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS), Data loss and Spam** - By exploiting internal services, attackers can potentially trigger DoS, data loss or spam related to the internal service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Redirect:** Attackers host a malicious server that responds with a 301 HTTP redirect.
*   **Media Upload Functionality:**  The attacker leverages the functionality that allows users to upload/share media files by providing a URL to a media file that will be fetched by vBulletin
*   **Crafted URLs:**  Attackers craft URLs that redirect the vBulletin server to internal services/ports (e.g. `http://localhost:3306` or `gopher://localhost:11211/datahere` or `gopher://localhost:10050/`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated access to vBulletin:** The attacker does not need to log in to exploit this vulnerability, they only need to send a POST request to the `/link/getlinkdata` endpoint with a crafted URL.
*   **External Server:** The attacker must control an external server capable of sending 301 HTTP redirects.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vBulletin server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit code (provided in the content) includes a Python script that sets up a redirect server, performs a port scan, and executes remote commands via the Zabbix agent, if available.
*   The vulnerability affects all vBulletin versions prior to the patches, including versions 5.x, 4.x, and 3.x.
*   Vendor released patches for vBulletin versions 5.2.3, 4.2.4 Beta, and 3.8.10 Beta.

In summary, this is a pre-authentication SSRF vulnerability due to lack of redirect validation. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to access internal services, perform port scanning, and even execute remote commands in some cases.
