Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2016-6310:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the disclosure of the `ENGINE_HTTPS_PKI_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `/var/log/ovirt-engine/engine.log` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive information (the password for the PKI trust store) is being logged in a plain text log file.
- Insecure logging of environment variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the log file can obtain the password for the PKI trust store.
- This could potentially allow the attacker to perform actions requiring access to the trust store, possibly leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access to the `/var/log/ovirt-engine/engine.log` file is required for successful exploitation.
- This could be achieved by an attacker gaining local access to the machine or compromising another service that can read the log file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to read the `/var/log/ovirt-engine/engine.log` file.
- This means they would likely require some form of access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in RHEV 4.0 GA.
- The environment variable `ENGINE_HTTPS_PKI_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD` is set by ovirt-engine.
