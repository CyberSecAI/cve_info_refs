Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of a default, hardcoded password for the "trove" service user in the crowbar-openstack and barclamp-trove projects. This default password was used during the initial setup of the Trove service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded Password:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a static, default password instead of generating a random one during service deployment.
*   **Predictable Credentials:**  The default password could be easily guessed or discovered by an attacker, making the Trove service vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains knowledge of the default password could gain unauthorized access to the Trove service.
*   **Data Breach:** This access could potentially lead to a data breach, where an attacker could access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   **Service Compromise:** The attacker could compromise the Trove service, potentially using it as a stepping stone to access other parts of the system or perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the Trove service would be able to attempt authentication using the default password.
*   **Internal Knowledge:** An attacker with internal knowledge about the crowbar-openstack/barclamp-trove deployment could leverage the default password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access to Trove service:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to reach the Trove service and attempt authentication.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know or discover the default password for the "trove" service user.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes the fix for this vulnerability which is to generate a random password instead of using a hardcoded one. This change is present in the following files:
* chef/data_bags/crowbar/migrate/trove/101_add_service_details.rb
* crowbar_framework/app/models/trove_service.rb
* chef/data\_bags/crowbar/migrate/trove/002\_add\_service\_details.rb (for barclamp-trove)
This change ensures that each Trove deployment will have a unique, unpredictable password.
The commit history shows that the fix was applied in multiple places, both in `crowbar-openstack` and `barclamp-trove` projects.
