Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that SOGo, when configured with "View the Date & Time" restrictions, still exposes the UID and DTSTAMP attributes of calendar entries in the ICS feed. This allows an attacker to correlate appointments of different users by joining on these attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leakage: The UID and DTSTAMP attributes, intended for internal use, are exposed even when permissions are restricted.
- Inadequate Access Control: The "View the Date & Time" permission fails to properly mask sensitive information.
- Lack of Data Sanitization/Obfuscation: The system does not modify or hide these attributes for restricted views.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability to derive meta-information and identify common appointments between users, even when permissions are set to "View the Date & Time" only.
- This can reveal private schedules, potentially exposing sensitive meetings (e.g., an appointment with the workers' council).

**Attack Vectors:**
- CalDAV access to the calendar data.
- Accessing the ICS feed of a user's calendar.
- An attacker could script a process to fetch appointments of all users via CalDAV or the ICS feed and perform joins to identify overlaps.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a user account, from which they can access other user's calendar data with the permission "View the Date & Time".
- Ability to send requests to the CalDAV interface or ICS feed.
- Technical skill to script retrieval of the data and perform correlation analysis.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the system to generate a derived UID based on `sha256(calendar_owner + salt + original_uid)` and by stripping the DTSTAMP attribute when needed.
- The fix was implemented in commit `717f45f640a2866b76a8984139391fae64339225` (for SOGo v2) and `875a4aca3218340fd4d3141950c82c2ff45b343d` (for SOGo v3).
- The fix involves changes to `SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m`, `SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserSettings.h`, and `SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserSettings.m`.
