- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect permission assignment for a security-critical resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager specifies permissions, allowing unintended actors to read or modify a security-critical resource.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized reading or modification of a security-critical resource.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N), low privilege (PR:L) is required and the attacker needs to have high access complexity (AC:H), no user interaction (UI:N) is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system and a low-privileged account on the system. The attack requires high complexity to perform.
