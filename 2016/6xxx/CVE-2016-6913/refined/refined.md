Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/ossim/conf/reload.php` script of AlienVault USM/OSSIM.
*   The script improperly handles user-supplied input provided through the "back" HTTP GET parameter.
*   The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the "back" parameter before using it in the `document.location.href` property in the embedded javascript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS, where the malicious payload is not directly reflected in the server's response but is introduced and executed through client-side JavaScript within the user's browser.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or validate the "back" parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they load the vulnerable page.
*   **User Redirection:** The injected JavaScript can be used to redirect the user to a malicious website.
*   **Browser and Plugin Exploitation:** The attacker could potentially exploit browser vulnerabilities or plugins by embedding relevant script codes.
*   **Administrative Interface Manipulation:** The vulnerability exists within the administrative interface of AlienVault, enabling a wide array of potential attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL by appending a payload to the "back" parameter of the `/ossim/conf/reload.php` script.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick an authenticated user into clicking on the crafted malicious URL, which contains the malicious payload, while that user has an active authenticated session with the AlienVault application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to trick an already authenticated user in order to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create a URL with a malicious payload within the "back" parameter.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to socially engineer the authenticated user to visit the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided Proof-of-Concept URL is: `https://127.0.0.1/ossim/conf/reload.php?what=policies&back=\%27;alert>(/XSS/);//`
*   The vulnerability is in the following javascript block within `/ossim/conf/reload.php`:
    ```javascript
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).ready(function(){
          if (typeof(top.refresh_notifications) == 'function')
          {
            top.refresh_notifications()
          }

         document.location.href = '\\';alert(/XSS/);//';
        });
    </script>
    ```
*   The vulnerable code directly uses the unsanitized `back` parameter within the `document.location.href` property.

**Solution:**
*   Upgrade to AlienVault OSSIM/USM 5.3, where this vulnerability is fixed.
