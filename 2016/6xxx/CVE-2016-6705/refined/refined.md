Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `SoundTrigger` service. The service obtains a pointer to a service interface by value rather than by reference. This allows another thread to clear the service pointer while it is still in use, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** Multiple threads accessing and modifying the service pointer concurrently without proper synchronization.
- **Use-After-Free:** The service pointer is accessed after it has been freed or invalidated, resulting in memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the privileged `Mediaserver` process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local malicious application could exploit the race condition by manipulating the `SoundTrigger` service in a specific manner, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition in the `SoundTrigger` service.
