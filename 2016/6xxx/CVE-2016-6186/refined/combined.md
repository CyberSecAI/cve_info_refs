## Django security releases issued: 1.10 release candidate 1, 1.9.8, and 1.8.14

Posted by **Tim Graham** on July 18, 2016

In accordance with [our security release policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/), the Django team is issuing [Django 1.10 release candidate 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.10/), [Django 1.9.8](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.9.8/) and [1.8.14](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.8.14/). These release addresses a security issue detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch is also updated.

Django 1.10 is now at release candidate stage. This marks the string freeze and the call for translators [to submit translations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/localizing/#translations). Provided no major bugs are discovered that can't be solved in the next two weeks, 1.10 final will be issued on or around August 1. Any delays will be communicated on the [django-developers mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/dbkoVkL81eM/discussion).

### CVE-2016-6186: XSS in admin's add/change related popup

Unsafe usage of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML could result in XSS in the
admin's add/change related popup. Element.textContent is now used to
prevent execution of the data.

The debug view also used innerHTML. Although a security issue wasn't
identified there, out of an abundance of caution it's also updated to use
textContent.

Thanks Vulnerability Laboratory for reporting the issue and Paulo Alvarado for forwarding it to us.

### Affected supported versions

* Django master development branch
* Django 1.10 (now at release candidate status)
* Django 1.9
* Django 1.8

Per our [supported versions policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#supported-versions), Django 1.7 and older are no longer receiving security updates.

### Resolution

Patches to resolve the issues have been applied to Django's master development branch and
the 1.10, 1.9, and 1.8 release branches. The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:

* On the [development master branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/93c538694e6b14a29cb0f52b784a3bfed604fda6)
* On the [1.10 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/6fa150b2f8b601668083042324c4add534143cb1)
* On the [1.9 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/d03bf6fe4e9bf5b07de62c1a271c4b41a7d3d158)
* On the [1.8 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/f68e5a99164867ab0e071a936470958ed867479d)

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.10rc1 ([download Django 1.10rc1](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.10/Django-1.10rc1.tar.gz) | [1.10rc1 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.10rc1.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.9.8 ([download Django 1.9.8](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.9/Django-1.9.8.tar.gz) | [1.9.8 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.9.8.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.8.14 ([download Django 1.8.14](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.8/Django-1.8.14.tar.gz) | [1.8.14 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.8.14.checksum.txt))

The PGP key ID used for these releases is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further
information.

At this time, I'm considering master feature frozen besides the tickets marked "ready for checkin" [1] and those tagged "1.10" [2]. Let me know if I missed anything critical.

I'll continue working with the ticket owners to polish those patches. I'll also continue merging bug fixes until we create the stable/1.10 branch and issue the alpha release, which I'd like to do sometime next week.

Issue: Fixing some new-style SessionMiddleware to process the response even if the view raises an exception.
Status: This is somewhat in design decision needed if anyone would like to take a look and offer feedback. I'll look at it more closely tomorrow.
<https://github.com/django/django/pull/6618>

Issue: Made CSRF tokens change every request.
Status: Awaiting final (trivial, I believe) updates from Shai.
<https://github.com/django/django/pull/5605>

Issue: i18n test failures on Windows
Status: Awaiting someone with interest in Windows i18n to investigate. I'm not considering this a blocker for the release (alpha or otherwise) since we can't guarantee sometime with Windows expertise to fix the issue.
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25677>

I hope to resolve these issues and make the alpha release tomorrow or Friday.![Tim Graham's profile photo](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXliYSW8WRPTgP7pnNvFrY1y1fL5vUyzDdOKSoDeBm4tWFmEu5s=s40-c)

I'm a bit worried about <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26719> which could have security implications for 1.10. To be investigated...

UserCreationForm doesn't call normalize\_email and normalize\_username
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26719>
Status: I sent some final edits to the PR and it should be ready for commit tomorrow.

Other possible blockers:

Different manager for \_base\_manager and related descriptors
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26749>
django-hvad is broken by the manager inheritance refactor and it's unclear if it can be adapted for the new behavior.

Update decorator\_from\_middleware() to work with DEP5 style middleware.
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26626>
Design decision needed, see <https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/hNQIaYcN3xM/discussion>

As long as no new issues pop up by tomorrow, I'm thinking to do the beta release then. We might consider a "beta 2" release around 2 weeks later if we decide to push fixes for the other two issues.![Tim Graham's profile photo](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXliYSW8WRPTgP7pnNvFrY1y1fL5vUyzDdOKSoDeBm4tWFmEu5s=s40-c)

## Django security releases issued: 1.10 release candidate 1, 1.9.8, and 1.8.14

Posted by **Tim Graham** on July 18, 2016

In accordance with [our security release policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/), the Django team is issuing [Django 1.10 release candidate 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.10/), [Django 1.9.8](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.9.8/) and [1.8.14](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.8.14/). These release addresses a security issue detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch is also updated.

Django 1.10 is now at release candidate stage. This marks the string freeze and the call for translators [to submit translations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/localizing/#translations). Provided no major bugs are discovered that can't be solved in the next two weeks, 1.10 final will be issued on or around August 1. Any delays will be communicated on the [django-developers mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/dbkoVkL81eM/discussion).

### CVE-2016-6186: XSS in admin's add/change related popup

Unsafe usage of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML could result in XSS in the
admin's add/change related popup. Element.textContent is now used to
prevent execution of the data.

The debug view also used innerHTML. Although a security issue wasn't
identified there, out of an abundance of caution it's also updated to use
textContent.

Thanks Vulnerability Laboratory for reporting the issue and Paulo Alvarado for forwarding it to us.

### Affected supported versions

* Django master development branch
* Django 1.10 (now at release candidate status)
* Django 1.9
* Django 1.8

Per our [supported versions policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#supported-versions), Django 1.7 and older are no longer receiving security updates.

### Resolution

Patches to resolve the issues have been applied to Django's master development branch and
the 1.10, 1.9, and 1.8 release branches. The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:

* On the [development master branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/93c538694e6b14a29cb0f52b784a3bfed604fda6)
* On the [1.10 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/6fa150b2f8b601668083042324c4add534143cb1)
* On the [1.9 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/d03bf6fe4e9bf5b07de62c1a271c4b41a7d3d158)
* On the [1.8 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/f68e5a99164867ab0e071a936470958ed867479d)

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.10rc1 ([download Django 1.10rc1](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.10/Django-1.10rc1.tar.gz) | [1.10rc1 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.10rc1.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.9.8 ([download Django 1.9.8](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.9/Django-1.9.8.tar.gz) | [1.9.8 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.9.8.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.8.14 ([download Django 1.8.14](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.8/Django-1.8.14.tar.gz) | [1.8.14 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.8.14.checksum.txt))

The PGP key ID used for these releases is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further
information.

Severity Level:
===============
Medium

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Django v3.3.0 Content Management System.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers or privileged user accounts to inject own malicious script codes to the
application-side of the vulnerable modules web context.

The persistent web vulnerability is located in the `Name` value of the `Editors - Code Snippet` module POST method request.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script code to the snippets name input field to provoke a persistent execution.
The injection point is the snippets add module of the editor. The execution point occurs in the `./djangocms_snippet/snippet/`
data listing after the add. The data context is not escaped or parsed on add to select and thus results in an execute of any
payload inside of the option tag.

The attacker vector of the vulnerability is persistent because of the data is stored on add and request method to inject is POST.
The vulnerability can be exploited against other privileged user accounts of the django application by interaction with already
existing snippets on add.

Already added elements become visible for the other user accounts as well on add interaction. The unescaped data is stored in
the database of the web-application but when rendered in the frontend or in the edit mode, it's properly escaped.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Editor - Snippets (Add)

Vulnerable Input(s):
				[+] Name

Parameter(s):
				[+] select

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Snippets Options Listing [./djangocms_snippet/snippet/] - option

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side validation web vulnerability can be exploited by low and high privileged web-application user accounts with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the application-side web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login to your django cms website with version 3.3.0
2. Open the structure module
3. Click to edit a page module
Note: Now the editor opens with the main default plugins
4. Mark a text passage and click to the code snippets plugin that is configured by default installation
5. Click the plus to add a new snippet of code
6. Inject a script code payload in java-script to the input field of the Name
7. Save the entry iva POST method request
8. Now click the box to choose the vulnerable injected payload
9. The script code payload executes in the box listing without secure parse or filter to encode
10. Successful reproduce of the application-side validation vulnerability in the editors snippet module!

Note:
Multiple accounts can be exploited by the inject of snippets. When another privileged user account includes a snippet
the stable saved categories provoke the execution of the payload.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the vulnerable Name input field in the add snippets editor module.
Restrict the input and disallow the usage of special chars. Escape the entries in case of emergency and use plain-text values.
Encode in the snippets module listing the vulnerable box with the name listing to prevent the execution point of the vulnerability.

Resolution:
Patches to resolve the issues have been applied to Django's master development branch and the 1.10, 1.9, and 1.8 release branches.
The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:

-    On the development master branch
-    On the 1.10 release branch
-    On the 1.9 release branch
-    On the 1.8 release branch

The following new releases have been issued:

-    Django 1.10rc1
-    Django 1.9.8
-    Django 1.8.14

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web vulnerability in the django cms is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.5)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

|  |  | Django 1.8.14 release notes |
|  |  | =========================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \*Under development\* |
|  |  | \*July 18, 2016\* |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Django 1.8.14 fixes several bugs in 1.8.13. |
|  |  | Django 1.8.14 fixes a security issue and a bug in 1.8.13. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | XSS in admin's add/change related popup |
|  |  | ======================================= |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Unsafe usage of JavaScript's ``Element.innerHTML`` could result in XSS in the |
|  |  | admin's add/change related popup. ``Element.textContent`` is now used to |
|  |  | prevent execution of the data. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The debug view also used ``innerHTML``. Although a security issue wasn't |
|  |  | identified there, out of an abundance of caution it's also updated to use |
|  |  | ``textContent``. |
|  |  |  |

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Severity Level:

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Django v3.3.0 Content Management
System.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers or privileged user accounts to inject own malicious script codes to
the
application-side of the vulnerable modules web context.

The persistent web vulnerability is located in the `Name` value of the `Editors - Code Snippet` module POST method
request.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script code to the snippets name input field to provoke a persistent
execution.
The injection point is the snippets add module of the editor. The execution point occurs in the
`./djangocms_snippet/snippet/`
data listing after the add. The data context is not escaped or parsed on add to select and thus results in an execute
of any
payload inside of the option tag.

The attacker vector of the vulnerability is persistent because of the data is stored on add and request method to
inject is POST.
The vulnerability can be exploited against other privileged user accounts of the django application by interaction with
already
existing snippets on add.

Already added elements become visible for the other user accounts as well on add interaction. The unescaped data is
stored in
the database of the web-application but when rendered in the frontend or in the edit mode, it's properly escaped.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count
of 3.5.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
                                [+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                [+] Editor - Snippets (Add)

Vulnerable Input(s):
                                [+] Name

Parameter(s):
                                [+] select

Affected Module(s):
                                [+] Snippets Options Listing [./djangocms_snippet/snippet/] - option

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side validation web vulnerability can be exploited by low and high privileged web-application user
accounts with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the application-side web vulnerability follow the provided information and
steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login to your django cms website with version 3.3.0
2. Open the structure module
3. Click to edit a page module
Note: Now the editor opens with the main default plugins
4. Mark a text passage and click to the code snippets plugin that is configured by default installation
5. Click the plus to add a new snippet of code
6. Inject a script code payload in java-script to the input field of the Name
7. Save the entry iva POST method request
8. Now click the box to choose the vulnerable injected payload
9. The script code payload executes in the box listing without secure parse or filter to encode
10. Successful reproduce of the application-side validation vulnerability in the editors snippet module!

Note:
Multiple accounts can be exploited by the inject of snippets. When another privileged user account includes a snippet
the stable saved categories provoke the execution of the payload.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the vulnerable Name input field in the add snippets editor module.
Restrict the input and disallow the usage of special chars. Escape the entries in case of emergency and use plain-text
values.
Encode in the snippets module listing the vulnerable box with the name listing to prevent the execution point of the
vulnerability.

Resolution:
Patches to resolve the issues have been applied to Django's master development branch and the 1.10, 1.9, and 1.8
release branches.
The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:

-    On the development master branch

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

# RHSA-2016:1595 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-django security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1595)

## Topic

An update for python-django is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Security Fix(es):

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Django. An attacker could exploit the unsafe usage of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML to forge content in the admin's add/change related popup. Element.textContent is now used to prevent XSS data execution. (CVE-2016-6186)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-django security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1594)

## Topic

An update for python-django is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 Operational Tools for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Security Fix(es):

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Django. An attacker could exploit the unsafe usage of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML to forge content in the admin's add/change related popup. Element.textContent is now used to prevent XSS data execution. (CVE-2016-6186)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 8 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1355663](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1355663)

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Django v3.3.0 Content Management System.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers or privileged user accounts to inject own malicious script codes to the
application-side of the vulnerable modules web context.
The persistent web vulnerability is located in the `Name` value of the `Editors - Code Snippet` module POST method request.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script code to the snippets name input field to provoke a persistent execution.
The injection point is the snippets add module of the editor. The execution point occurs in the `./djangocms\_snippet/snippet/`
data listing after the add. The data context is not escaped or parsed on add to select and thus results in an execute of any
payload inside of the option tag.
The attacker vector of the vulnerability is persistent because of the data is stored on add and the request method to inject is POST.
The vulnerability can be exploited against other privileged user accounts of the django application by interaction with already
existing snippets on add.
Already added elements become visible for the other user accounts as well on add interaction. The unescaped data is stored in
the database of the web-application but when rendered in the frontend or in the edit mode, it's properly escaped.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side validation web vulnerability can be exploited by low and high privileged web-application user accounts with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the application-side web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login to your django cms website with version 3.3.0
2. Open the structure module
3. Click to edit a page module
Note: Now the editor opens with the main default plugins
4. Mark a text passage and click to the code snippets plugin that is configured by default installation
5. Click the plus to add a new snippet of code
6. Inject a script code payload in java-script to the input field of the Name
7. Save the entry iva POST method request
8. Now click the box to choose the vulnerable injected payload
9. The script code payload executes in the box listing without secure parse or filter to encode
10. Successful reproduce of the application-side validation vulnerability in the editors snippet module!
Note:
Multiple accounts can be exploited by the inject of snippets. When another privileged user account includes a snippet
the stable saved categories provoke the execution of the payload.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the vulnerable Name input field in the add snippets editor module.
Restrict the input and disallow the usage of special chars. Escape the entries in case of emergency and use plain-text values.
Encode in the snippets module listing the vulnerable box with the name listing to prevent the execution point of the vulnerability.
Resolution:
Patches to resolve the issues have been applied to Django's master development branch and the 1.10, 1.9, and 1.8 release branches.
The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:
- On the development master branch
- On the 1.10 release branch
- On the 1.9 release branch
- On the 1.8 release branch
The following new releases have been issued:
- Django 1.10rc1
- Django 1.9.8
- Django 1.8.14

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1596)

## Topic

An update for python-django is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Security Fix(es):

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Django. An attacker could exploit the unsafe usage of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML to forge content in the admin's add/change related popup. Element.textContent is now used to prevent XSS data execution. (CVE-2016-6186)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue.
