  "CVE-2016-6186": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Django. An attacker could exploit the unsafe usage of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML to forge content in the admin's add/change related popup. Element.textContent is now used to prevent XSS data execution.",
    "vulnerability": "XSS vulnerability due to unsafe usage of JavaScript's `Element.innerHTML`.",
    "impact": "An attacker could forge content in the admin's add/change related popup, leading to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious script code into the `Name` field of the `Editors - Code Snippet` module. The injected code is then executed when a user selects this snippet in the admin's add/change related popup.",
    "required_capabilities": "Requires a low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.",
    "root_cause": "The unsafe usage of JavaScript's `Element.innerHTML` allows for the execution of injected script code. The vulnerability occurs because data isn't properly sanitized and escaped.",
      "additional_details": "The debug view also used innerHTML. Although a security issue wasn't identified there, out of an abundance of caution it's also updated to use textContent."
