Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-6385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the Smart Install client feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software. This memory leak is triggered by specially crafted packets sent to TCP port 4786.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The software fails to properly validate the input received on port 4786/TCP, leading to the memory leak.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (CWE-400)**: The continuous leak of memory leads to resource exhaustion on the affected device

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause a memory leak, which eventually leads to a denial of service condition, and may require the device to reload.
*   The device becomes unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted packets over the network to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not require any credentials or prior access to the affected device.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted device and must be able to send packets to port 4786.
*   **Low to Medium Skill:**  An attacker with low to medium skills is capable of exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Smart Install client feature, which is enabled by default on Cisco IOS switches.
*   The Smart Install feature is used for zero-touch deployment of new switches.
*   Devices configured as Smart Install directors are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   A workaround involves disabling the Smart Install client feature using the `no vstack` command on vulnerable releases that support it.
*   Cisco has released free software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a support case.
*   There were no known public exploits at the time of the advisory.
*   Rockwell Automation's Allen-Bradley Stratix industrial switches are also affected by this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS v2 score for this vulnerability is 7.8 (Base) and 6.4 (Temporal).
*   The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 8.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)
