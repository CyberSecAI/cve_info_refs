Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-6602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a weak obfuscation algorithm used to store user passwords in the `securitydbData.xml` file within the WebNMS WEB-INF directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak Obfuscation:** The passwords are not properly encrypted, but "obfuscated" using a simple algorithm easily reversible.
- **Credentials Storage:** Usernames and obfuscated passwords stored in a single file (`securitydbData.xml`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve usernames and plaintext passwords for all user accounts on the system.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With valid credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the WebNMS Framework Server and perform actions based on the compromised user's privileges.
- **Combined Attack:** This vulnerability can be combined with the directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2016-6601) to directly download the `securitydbData.xml` file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** Requires network access to the vulnerable WebNMS server.

**Additional Details:**
- The `securitydbData.xml` file contains entries with usernames and their corresponding obfuscated passwords.
- The provided example shows that the user `guest` has the obfuscated password `e8c89O1f` (actual password is `guest`) and the user `root` has `d7963B4t` (actual password is `admin`).
- A Metasploit module has been developed to automate the deobfuscation process.
- The vulnerability affects at least WebNMS Framework Server versions 5.2 and 5.2 SP1.

In summary, CVE-2016-6602 is a credential disclosure vulnerability due to weak obfuscation of passwords, which can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
