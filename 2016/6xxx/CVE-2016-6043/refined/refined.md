- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Session expiration is not enforced in Tivoli Storage Manager Operations Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate session management leading to potential session hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can take over a previously logged-in user's session. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and needs to be present when a legitimate user has logged into the application and left the session open. The attacker could then potentially resume the existing session without authentication.
