- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Wi-Fi driver of certain Huawei smartphones due to a lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to missing parameter checks in the Wi-Fi driver.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to system crashes or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application on their smartphone. The malicious app then sends crafted parameters to the Wi-Fi driver to trigger the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious app to the targeted users and convince them to install it. This requires social engineering or other forms of application distribution.
