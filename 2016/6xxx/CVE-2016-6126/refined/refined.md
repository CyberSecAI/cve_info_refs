- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing directory traversal using "dot dot" sequences (/../) in URL requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted URL request containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending the crafted URL request. The attacker needs to have some level of access to send requests to the system. The CVSS vector indicates that low privileges are required (PR:L), but the text does not indicate if this is an authenticated or unauthenticated context.
