Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `ident` value within the `kevent` system call handler in the OpenBSD kernel. An overly large `ident` value can lead to a large calculated `size` within the `kevent` system call, which in turn triggers an assertion failure within the `mallocarray()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow/Unchecked Size:** The core weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking on the user-supplied `ident` value before using it to calculate the allocation size.
*   **Kernel Panic:** This condition can lead to a kernel panic, causing a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation leads to a kernel panic, causing the system to become unresponsive.
*  **System Crash**: The kernel panic crashes the whole system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by making a crafted `kevent` system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** Any local user on the system can exploit this vulnerability since the `kevent` system call is available to all users.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
*  The provided information includes specific details on how the vulnerability is triggered through the `kevent` system call and how the lack of validation leads to the crash.
* The content also includes a link to the commit diff related to the fix: `http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/kern/kern_event.c.diff?r1=1.72&r2=1.73`.
