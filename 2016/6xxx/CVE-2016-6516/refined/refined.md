Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A double-fetch vulnerability was introduced when code related to file deduplication was moved from the Btrfs filesystem to the generic Virtual File System (VFS) layer. This occurred in commit `54dbc1517237`.
- The vulnerability stems from fetching a size value from user-space twice, potentially allowing a malicious user to manipulate the size between the first and second fetch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double Fetch:** The core issue is the double fetching of the `count` variable from user space.
- **Undersized Allocation:**  By manipulating the value of `count` between the fetches, an attacker can cause the kernel to allocate a smaller buffer than is needed.
- **Heap Overflow:** After the undersized buffer is allocated, the kernel will then attempt to copy more data into it than it can hold, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Heap Overflow:**  The most direct impact is the corruption of heap memory, which can be used to overwrite other kernel objects.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution with root privileges. The provided information mentions an attempt to overwrite a pointer to point to userland memory, though this was unsuccessful.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **ioctl System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `ioctl` system call when using the `FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE` operation.
- **User Space Control:** The attacker controls the data and the size that are passed via user space to the `ioctl` system call.
- **Manipulated Size:** The attacker exploits the double fetch by changing the value of `count` between fetches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:**  The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to make `ioctl` system calls and open files that support the `FILE_DEDUPE_RANGE` operation.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** An attacker needs to be aware of the double-fetch vulnerability and how to exploit it by manipulating the size between the two fetches.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `10eec60ce79187686e052092e5383c99b4420a20`.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) was created, and while a full exploit wasn't created by the reporter, the potential for a user-to-root exploit was identified.
- The overflow occurs on a cache that can be controlled by the user.
- The vulnerability was reported in the Linux kernel versions 4.5 and later before the patch.

In summary, CVE-2016-6516 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Linux kernel caused by a double fetch during the file deduplication ioctl operation. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution by a local user.
