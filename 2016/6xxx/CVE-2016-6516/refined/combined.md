vfs: ioctl: prevent double-fetch in dedupe ioctlThis prevents a double-fetch from user space that can lead to to an
undersized allocation and heap overflow.

Message-ID: <579E6CC0.2020509@plzdonthack.me>

Subject: CVE Request: Linux >= 4.5 double fetch leading to heap overflow

Good afternoon,

For Mitre:

Some code was moved from btrfs to the generic vfs ioctl:
(<https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/fs/ioctl.c?h=v4.5&id=54dbc15172375641ef03399e8f911d7165eb90fb>).

During the port a double fetch with userland was introduced which can lead to an undersized allocation and subsequent heap overflow
with potentially controlled data. It has been patched in upstream here:

<https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=10eec60ce79187686e052092e5383c99b4420a20>

For OSS-sec:

attached is a PoC. I attempted to write an exploit for this but that's not really my forte. I feel like this bug
has the potential for a workable user->root exploit but I couldn't do it.

1: You can control which cache the overflow happens on. I picked the same cache as the File struct.
2: the code writes 2 different width zeros past the allocation, one 32 bit and the other 64 bit.
3: I attempted to overflow and write the 32 bit 0 to the top half of a pointer so it would point to userland,
but I couldn't find a suitable structure to overflow into.

So if anyone plays around with this and gets a workable exploit please share the details as I'm looking to expand my exploitation knowledge, and techniques.

Thank you,
--Scott

For the poc:

This prevents a double-fetch from user space that can lead to to an
undersized allocation and heap overflow.
