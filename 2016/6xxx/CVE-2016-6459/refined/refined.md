Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a local command injection flaw in Cisco TelePresence endpoints running either CE or TC software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The system allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected device.
*   The impact is rated as "Complete" for Confidentiality, "None" for Integrity, and "None" for Availability according to the CVSS score. This suggests an attacker could gain access to sensitive information but not modify data or disrupt service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Low Access Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
*   **Single Authentication (Au:S):** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the affected Cisco TelePresence endpoint.
*   No specific exploit is needed; the CVSS indicates "Functional" exploit code is available.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all TelePresence endpoints running CE or TC software prior to the first fix.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.6, and a temporal score of 4.4, with the following vector: AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C
