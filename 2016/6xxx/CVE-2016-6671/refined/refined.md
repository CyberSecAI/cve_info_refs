Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6671

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `raw_decode` function within `libavcodec/rawdec.c` of FFmpeg.
- Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when handling palette data within a SWF file.
- The `memcpy` operation copies data from `pal` to `context->palette->data` without proper size checks leading to overflow if `avpkt->size - vid_size` is larger than `AVPALETTE_SIZE` when  `context->is_nut_pal8` is set and no palette side data is available.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The provided backtrace shows that the overflow leads to a crash, which is a denial-of-service.
- **Potential for RCE:** While the immediate impact is a crash, a heap-based overflow can, under certain circumstances, be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if exploited maliciously.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SWF File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted SWF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Access:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted SWF file to a system that uses the vulnerable version of FFmpeg.
- **No privilege required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user without any special privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** FFmpeg versions 3.1.1 and earlier.
- **Fixed Version:** FFmpeg version 3.1.2
- The patch adds a size check and a guard to prevent the overflow, ensuring the `memcpy` operation does not write beyond the allocated memory for the palette.
