{
  "CVE-2016-6261": {
    "Description": "The idna_to_ascii_4i function in lib/idna.c in libidn before 1.33 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) via 64 bytes of input.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `idna_to_ascii_4i` function of the `libidn` library. When the input string to this function is exactly 64 bytes long, the code does not null-terminate the output buffer before calculating its length, leading to a read beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful attack results in a denial of service due to a crash caused by the out-of-bounds read. The attacker can also potentially read sensitive memory information.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted 64-byte string to the vulnerable `idna_to_ascii_4i` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide the crafted input string to a vulnerable application or service using the libidn library. This does not require any special privileges or user interaction, making it remotely exploitable."
