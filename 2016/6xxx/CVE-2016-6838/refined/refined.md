The content is related to CVE-2016-6838.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of users to select security encryption algorithms on certain Huawei servers. If an insecure encryption algorithm is chosen, an attacker can potentially decrypt ciphertext data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of insecure encryption algorithms.
- Information leak vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to the decryption of ciphertext data, resulting in information leaks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access is required.
- The attacker exploits the ability to select an insecure encryption algorithm.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the network where the affected Huawei servers are located.
- The attacker needs to know that the insecure algorithm was selected.

**Additional details:**
