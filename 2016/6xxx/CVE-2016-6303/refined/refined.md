Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-6303 from the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   An integer overflow occurs in the `MDC2_Update()` function within the OpenSSL crypto library when handling very large amounts of input data after a previous call to `EVP_EncryptUpdate()` with a partial block. This leads to an incorrect length check calculation, causing memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** A flaw in the calculation of the input data length allows it to exceed the maximum allowed value, leading to an overflow condition.
*   **Heap Corruption:** The integer overflow bypasses the correct length check which results in a heap buffer overflow due to incorrect memory management.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap corruption leads to application crashes.
*   **Potential for other unspecified impacts:** There may be additional exploitable consequences of the heap corruption that are not fully understood.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a remote attacker.
*   The attacker needs to supply an excessive amount of input data after a previous partial-block encryption operation.
*   The attack is through the OpenSSL `MDC2_Update()` or `EVP_DigestUpdate()` functions using MDC2.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send a large quantity of crafted input data to an application that uses OpenSSL, triggering the overflow condition after a partial `EVP_EncryptUpdate` call. This typically requires control over the content of a network message.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges beyond the ability to send network data to an affected application or server.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0.
*   The Tenable advisory TNS-2016-16 addresses this and several other vulnerabilities
*   The vulnerability is also mentioned in relation to FreeBSD and Tenable's LCE and PVS products
*   RedHat bugzilla indicates that the vulnerability is not exploitable on RedHat due to the lack of MDC-2 support
*   The nodejs advisory indicates the vulnerability as "OOB write in MDC2\_Update()", but rates it as *very low* severity for Node.js users due to the impracticalities of exploiting it and the very low usage of MDC-2.
*   Siemens advisory indicates the vulnerability affects SCALANCE X-200RNA switch devices prior to V3.2.7
*   The Tenable advisory for PVS indicates a worst-case scenario CVSSv2 score and notes there has been no known exploit of this issue in their products.
*   Tenable's advisory for LCE notes these issues may not impact LCE at all due to integration.

In summary, this CVE involves a heap buffer overflow triggered by an integer overflow in OpenSSL's MDC2 digest processing. This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause DoS or other undefined behavior in applications that use OpenSSL and process untrusted input. The attack requires sending very large amounts of data after a prior partial block encryption.
