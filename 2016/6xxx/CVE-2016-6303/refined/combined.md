0. Revision history
v1.0 2016-09-23 Initial release.
v1.1 2016-09-26 Revised patch to address a regression in CVE-2016-2182 fix.
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension.
If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status
Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the
server. [CVE-2016-6304]
An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or through
the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply
very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate()
with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap
corruption. [CVE-2016-6303]
If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a
DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will
ultimately crash. [CVE-2016-6302]
The function BN\_bn2dec() does not check the return value of BN\_div\_word().
This can cause an OOB write if an application uses this function with an
overly large BIGNUM. This could be a problem if an overly large certificate
or CRL is printed out from an untrusted source. TLS is not affected because
record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.
[CVE-2016-2182]
The function TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() misuses OBJ\_obj2txt(): the return value is
the total length the OID text representation would use and not the amount
of data written. This will result in OOB reads when large OIDs are presented.
[CVE-2016-2180]
Some calculations of limits in OpenSSL have used undefined pointer arithmetic.
This could cause problems with some malloc implementations. [CVE-2016-2177]
Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to
avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that
a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. [CVE-2016-2178]
In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those
messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later
use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages
do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed.
An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when
they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS
connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore
the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection.
[CVE-2016-2179]
A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that
arrive for future epochs update the replay protection "window" before the MAC
for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by
sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a
valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent
legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific
DTLS connection. [CVE-2016-2181]
In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in
OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical
DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms.
[CVE-2016-6306]
III. Impact
A remote attacker can cause OpenSSL server, regardless whether OCSP is supported,
to have unbounded memory growth, and eventually lead to a Denial of Service.
[CVE-2016-6304]
If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous
call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow
resulting in a heap corruption. [CVE-2016-6303]
An attacker who can send a malformed ticket to the server can cause an OOB read
which will ultimately lead to a crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.
[CVE-2016-6302]
A local attacker can cause an application that parses overly large certificate or
CRL to crash. TLS is not affected. [CVE-2016-2182]
A local attacker who can create a specially-crafted time stamp file and pass it
through the "ts" command of openssl(1) can cause it to crash. This functionality
is not used by the SSL/TLS implementation. [CVE-2016-2180]
Some OpenSSL code is questionable to integer overflow, which may lead to heap
corruption. [CVE-2016-2177]
An attacker may recover the private DSA key by conducting timing attack.
[CVE-2016-2178]
A remote attacker may cause a DTLS server to exhaust memory, resulting in a
Denial of Service. [CVE-2016-2179]
A remote attacker who can send DTLS records can cause the server to drop all
subsequent packets for a specific connection. [CVE-2016-2181]
A remote attacker can, in theory, cause OOB reads if the server enabled client
authentication. [CVE-2016-6306]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 10.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:26/openssl-10.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:26/openssl-10.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.3.patch.asc

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:26/openssl-fix.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:26/openssl-fix.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-fix.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .

# [R2] LCE 4.8.2 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

LCE 4.8.1 is possibly impacted by multiple vulnerabilities reported in third-party libraries. Tenable has not investigated each one to determine if it is exploitable or the vulnerable code path can be reached. Instead, Dev has upgraded the impacted libraries as a faster and safer alternative. Due to the number of library upgrades and the potential for any of these issues to impact LCE users, we strongly encourage you to upgrade. In some cases, older versions than 4.8.0 may be impacted by a subset of these issues.

The following vulnerabilities have been resolved with the updated libraries. Note that several of these issues do not have a CVE assigned.

* SQLite ATTACH / DETACH Statement Handling NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* curl IDNA Puny Code Translation Incorrect Host Resolution Weakness
* curl tool\_urlglob.c Globbing Feature Out-of-bounds Access Issues
* curl lib/escape.c curl\_easy\_unescape() Function URL Unescape Integer Truncation Heap Buffer Overflow
* curl lib/url.c ConnectionExists() Function Connection Reuse Case-insensitive Password Comparison Remote Weakness
* curl lib/parsedate.c parsedate() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* curl lib/cookie.c Shared Cookies Handling Use-after-free Information Disclosure
* curl lib/mprintf.c alloc\_addbyter() Function Double-free DoS
* curl lib/url.c parseurlandfillconn() Function Authority Component Invalid URL Parsing Host Connection Issue
* curl lib/cookie.c Curl\_cookie\_init() Function Arbitrary Cookie Injection
* curl lib/security.c read\_data() Function Kerberos Authentication Handling Double-free Unspecified Issue
* curl lib/base64.c base64\_encode() Function Integer Overflow Heap Buffer Overflow
* curl lib/escape.c Multiple Functions String Length Handling Integer Overflow Heap Buffer Overflow
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the cURL / libcurl integration into LCE and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact LCE at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that LCE be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Log Correlation Engine (LCE) 4.8.2 has been released, which updates the linked OpenSSL, cURL / libcurl, and SQLite libraries. The new version [can be obtained on the Tenable Support Portal](https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=180).

# [R3] PVS 5.2.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable's Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) uses third-party libraries to provide certain standardized functionality. Four of these libraries were found to contain vulnerabilities and were fixed upstream. Those fixes have been integrated despite there being no known exploitation scenarios related to PVS.

* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* SQLite Insecure Temporary Directory Usage Local Issue
* Expat XML Parser Input Document Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c XML\_GetBuffer() Function Compressed XML Content Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c generate\_hash\_secret\_salt() Function PRNG Non-random Output Generation Weakness
* Expat xmlparse.c Hash Table Collision DoS
* jQuery UI dialog() Function closeText Parameter XSS

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the OpenSSL integration into PVS and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact PVS at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that PVS be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

Additionally, a reflected XSS vulnerability affecting the PVS Web GUI was fixed in the HTML 1.7.1 and Web Server 1.8.0 updates delivered via the plugin feed on November 14, 2016. A default install of PVS 5.2.0 includes these fixes. This issue was reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

### Solution

Tenable has released version 5.2.0 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), jQuery UI (1.12.0), Expat (2.2.0), and SQLite (3.13.0), which are not affected. The new version is available at:

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Security updates for all active release lines, September 2016
## [*(Update 27-September-2016)* Releases available](#update-27-september-2016-releases-available)

Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. These include the recently published versions of OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 as well as fixes for some Node.js-specific security-related defects.

The OpenSSL security fixes included in these updates that impact Node.js are:

* [CVE-2016-6304](#CVE-2016-6304): "OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth"
* [CVE-2016-2183](#CVE-2016-2183): "SWEET32 Mitigation"
* [CVE-2016-6303](#CVE-2016-6303): "OOB write in MDC2\_Update()"
* [CVE-2016-2178](#CVE-2016-2178): "Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing"
* [CVE-2016-6306](#CVE-2016-6306): "Certificate message OOB reads"

Details on each of these can be found in the original post below.

Additionally, OpenSSL 1.0.2j was released yesterday and included a fix for [CVE-2016-7052](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-7052). This flaw was introduced in last week's 1.0.2i release, and therefore does not directly impact Node.js.

## [Node.js-specific security flaws](#nodejs-specific-security-flaws)

Also included, are a number of fixes unrelated to the recent OpenSSL releases.

### [CVE-2016-7099: Wildcard certificates not properly validated](#cve-2016-7099-wildcard-certificates-not-properly-validated)

This is a high severity defect that would allow a malicious TLS server to serve an invalid wildcard certificate for its hostname and be improperly validated by a Node.js client. This is due to a flaw in the validation of `*.` in the wildcard name string.

Originally reported by Alexander Minozhenko and James Bunton (Atlassian).

All versions of Node.js are **affected**.

### [CVE-2016-5325: `reason` argument in `ServerResponse#writeHead()` not properly validated](#cve-2016-5325-reason-argument-in-serverresponsewritehead-not-properly-validated)

This is a low severity security defect that may make [HTTP response splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting) possible under certain circumstances. If user-input is passed to the `reason` argument to `writeHead()` on an HTTP response, a new-line character may be used to inject additional responses.

The fix for this defect introduces a new case where `throw` may occur when configuring HTTP responses. Users should already be adopting try/catch here.

This was originally reported independently by Evan Lucas and Romain Gaucher.

All versions of Node.js are **affected**.

### [Remove support for loading dynamic third-party engine modules](#remove-support-for-loading-dynamic-third-party-engine-modules)

This is a low severity security defect. By default, OpenSSL will load a list of third-party engine modules when the `ENGINE_load_builtin_engines()` function is used. These are normally not present on a user's system. An attacker may be able to make Node.js load malicious code by masquerading it as one of the dynamic engine modules.

This defect primarily impacts Windows due to the standard DLL search paths. However, Unix users may also be at risk with a poorly configured `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable or /etc/ld.so.conf path list.

Originally reported by Ahmed Zaki (Skype).

* Node.js v6 (Current) ***is affected***
* Node.js v4 (LTS "Argon") ***is affected***
* Node.js v0.12 (Maintenance) ***is affected***
* Node.js v0.10 (Maintenance) ***is not affected***

### [Downloads](#downloads)

* [Node.js v6.7.0](/en/blog/release/v6.7.0/)
* [Node.js v4.6.0 (LTS "Argon")](/en/blog/release/v4.6.0/)
* [Node.js v0.12.16 (Maintenance)](/en/blog/release/v0.12.16/)
* [Node.js v0.10.47 (Maintenance)](/en/blog/release/v0.10.47/)

Please note that this may be the final release of the v0.10 line as support ends in October. Please upgrade to v4 or above if you have not already done so.

***Original post is included below***

---

The Node.js project has scheduled updates for all of its active release lines to patch a number of security flaws. These flaws include some of those [announced](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt) by the OpenSSL project as well as a number of Node.js-specific issues. We do not consider any of these updates to be critical. However, it is strongly recommended that all production instances of Node.js be upgraded when the releases are made available.

We intend to make releases available on or soon after the evening of **Tuesday, the 27th of September, 2016, UTC** (midday US time).

We consider some of the patches in these releases to be API *breaking* changes which would normally warrant an increase in the major-version number of Node.js. However, in accordance with our security procedures, we will be delivering these changes in minor-version increases (the *y* in *x.y.z*) where appropriate, and patch-version increases in v0.10 an v0.12 releases.

These are the expected version numbers for the releases:

* Node.js v6.7.0 (Current)
* Node.js v4.6.0 (LTS "Argon")
* Node.js v0.12.16 (Maintenance)
* Node.js v0.10.47 (Maintenance)

Additional notes:

* As per our [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS), support for Node.js v0.10 will cease in October. Therefore, this may be the final release of Node.js v0.10. If you are still using v0.10 in production, it is essential that you plan for a migration to v4 (LTS "Argon") or v6 (LTS to be announced in October) as soon as possible.
* In accordance with our security release procedures, we will be limiting changes included in the LTS and Maintenance lines (v4, v0.12, and v0.10) *for these updates* to only security-related and other critical fixes that provide for maximum stability for users.

## [Node.js-specific security flaws](#nodejs-specific-security-flaws-1)

Included in these releases will be a number of fixes unrelated to the recent OpenSSL releases. These include:

* A high-severity flaw relating to the processing of TLS certificates, impacting all versions of Node.js
* A low-severity native code injection vulnerability on Windows, impacting all versions of Node.js
* A low-severity HTTP validation error, impacting all versions of Node.js

Full disclosure of fixed vulnerabilities will be provided after all releases are made available for download.

## [September OpenSSL Releases](#september-openssl-releases)

The OpenSSL project has [announced](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt) the general availability of versions [1.0.2i](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.0.2-notes.html) (to be included in Node.js v4 and above) and [1.0.1u](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.0.1-notes.html) (to be included in Node.js v0.10 and v0.12). Our crypto team (Shigeki Ohtsu, Fedor Indutny, and Ben Noordhuis) have performed an analysis of the defects addressed in the OpenSSL releases to determine their impact on Node.js. The results of this analysis are included below.

### [[CVE-2016-6304](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6304): OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth](#cve-2016-6304-ocsp-status-request-extension-unbounded-memory-growth)

A malicious client can exhaust a server's memory, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) by sending very large OCSP Status Request extensions in a single session.

This flaw is labelled *high* severity due to the ease of use for a DoS attack and Node.js servers using TLS are vulnerable.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6305](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6305): SSL\_peek() hang on empty record](#cve-2016-6305-ssl_peek-hang-on-empty-record)

OpenSSL 1.1.0 SSL/TLS will hang during a call to `SSL_peek()` if the peer sends an empty record.

Node.js is not yet dependent on OpenSSL 1.1.0 so it is not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2183](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2183): SWEET32 Mitigation](#cve-2016-2183-sweet32-mitigation)

[SWEET32](https://sweet32.info) is a new attack on older block cipher algorithms that use a block size of 64 bits.

As mitigation, OpenSSL has moved DES-based ciphers from the `HIGH` to `MEDIUM` group. As Node.js includes `HIGH`, but not `MEDIUM`, in its default suite, affected ciphers are no longer included unless the default suite is not used. Node's default TLS cipher suite can be found in the [API documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_modifying_the_default_tls_cipher_suite).

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6303](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6303): OOB write in MDC2\_Update()](#cve-2016-6303-oob-write-in-mdc2_update)

An overflow can occur in `MDC2_Update()` under certain circumstances resulting in an out of bounds (OOB) error. This attack is impractical on most platforms due to the size of data required to trigger the OOB error.

Node.js is impacted by this flaw but due to the impracticalities of exploiting it and the very low usage of MDC-2, it is *very low* severity for Node.js users.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6302](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6302): Malformed SHA512 ticket DoS](#cve-2016-6302-malformed-sha512-ticket-dos)

If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC, it is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack via crash upon receiving a malformed ticket.

Node.js does not use SHA512 for session tickets and is therefore not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2182](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2182): OOB write in BN\_bn2dec()](#cve-2016-2182-oob-write-in-bn_bn2dec)

An out of bounds (OOB) write can occur in `BN_bn2dec()` if an application uses this function with an overly large `BIGNUM`. TLS is not affected because record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2180](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2180): OOB read in TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio()](#cve-2016-2180-oob-read-in-ts_obj_print_bio)

An out of bounds (OOB) read can occur when large OIDs are presented via `TS_OBJ_print_bio()`.

Node.js does not make use of the Time Stamp Authority functionality in OpenSSL and is therefore believed to be unaffected by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2177](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2177): Pointer arithmetic undefined behavior](#cve-2016-2177-pointer-arithmetic-undefined-behavior)

This programming flaw is described in the post at <https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/06/27/undefined-pointer-arithmetic/>.

It is unlikely that Node.js users are directly impacted by this.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2178](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2178): Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing](#cve-2016-2178-constant-time-flag-not-preserved-in-dsa-signing)

A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.

This is *very low* severity for Node.js users due to the difficulty in taking advantage of this attack and because DSA is very rarely used.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2179](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2179): DTLS buffered message DoS](#cve-2016-2179-dtls-buffered-message-dos)

In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order, those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.

As Node.js does not support DTLS, users are not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2179](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2179): DTLS replay protection DoS](#cve-2016-2179-dtls-replay-protection-dos)

A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism that would allow an attacker to force a server to drop legitimate packets for a DTLS connection, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) for that connection.

As Node.js does not support DTLS, users are not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6306](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6306): Certificate message OOB reads](#cve-2016-6306-certificate-message-oob-reads)

Some missing message length checks can result in out of bounds (OOB) reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical denial of service (DoS) risk. This only impacts a client or a server which enables client authentication.

Node.js is impacted by this *low* severity flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6307](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6307): Excessive allocation of memory in tls\_get\_message\_header()](#cve-2016-6307-excessive-allocation-of-memory-in-tls_get_message_header)

Excessive allocation of memory in OpenSSL 1.1.0 can be achieved by manipulating the length component of a TLS header.

Node.js is not yet dependent on OpenSSL 1.1.0 so it is not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6308](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6308): Excessive allocation of memory in dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment()](#cve-2016-6308-excessive-allocation-of-memory-in-dtls1_preprocess_fragment)

A flaw that is similar to CVE-2016-6307 but impacting DTLS.

Node.js is not yet dependent on OpenSSL 1.1.0, nor does it implement DTLS, so it is not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

#### Description

The XML parser (xmlparse.c) in expat before 2.1.0 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with many identifiers with the same value.

Therefore, this issue can not affect those packages.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1370146#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-20 20:25:35 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of openssl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and 7, as they did not include support for MDC-2.   ``` |  |

## TLS (SSL)[#](#tls-ssl)

[Stability: 2](documentation.html#stability-index) - Stable

**Source Code:** [lib/tls.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v23.6.1/lib/tls.js)

The `node:tls` module provides an implementation of the Transport Layer Security
(TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols that is built on top of OpenSSL.
The module can be accessed using:

```
import tls from 'node:tls';const tls = require('node:tls');copy
```
### Determining if crypto support is unavailable[#](#determining-if-crypto-support-is-unavailable)

It is possible for Node.js to be built without including support for the
`node:crypto` module. In such cases, attempting to `import` from `tls` or
calling `require('node:tls')` will result in an error being thrown.

When using CommonJS, the error thrown can be caught using try/catch:

```
let tls;
try {
  tls = require('node:tls');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('tls support is disabled!');
} copy
```

When using the lexical ESM `import` keyword, the error can only be
caught if a handler for `process.on('uncaughtException')` is registered
*before* any attempt to load the module is made (using, for instance,
a preload module).

When using ESM, if there is a chance that the code may be run on a build
of Node.js where crypto support is not enabled, consider using the
[`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) function instead of the lexical `import` keyword:

```
let tls;
try {
  tls = await import('node:tls');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('tls support is disabled!');
} copy
```
### TLS/SSL concepts[#](#tlsssl-concepts)

TLS/SSL is a set of protocols that rely on a public key infrastructure (PKI) to
enable secure communication between a client and a server. For most common
cases, each server must have a private key.

Private keys can be generated in multiple ways. The example below illustrates
use of the OpenSSL command-line interface to generate a 2048-bit RSA private
key:

```
openssl genrsa -out ryans-key.pem 2048 copy
```

With TLS/SSL, all servers (and some clients) must have a *certificate*.
Certificates are *public keys* that correspond to a private key, and that are
digitally signed either by a Certificate Authority or by the owner of the
private key (such certificates are referred to as "self-signed"). The first
step to obtaining a certificate is to create a *Certificate Signing Request*
(CSR) file.

The OpenSSL command-line interface can be used to generate a CSR for a private
key:

```
openssl req -new -sha256 -key ryans-key.pem -out ryans-csr.pem copy
```

Once the CSR file is generated, it can either be sent to a Certificate
Authority for signing or used to generate a self-signed certificate.

Creating a self-signed certificate using the OpenSSL command-line interface
is illustrated in the example below:

```
openssl x509 -req -in ryans-csr.pem -signkey ryans-key.pem -out ryans-cert.pem copy
```

Once the certificate is generated, it can be used to generate a `.pfx` or
`.p12` file:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -in ryans-cert.pem -inkey ryans-key.pem \
      -certfile ca-cert.pem -out ryans.pfx copy
```

Where:

* `in`: is the signed certificate
* `inkey`: is the associated private key
* `certfile`: is a concatenation of all Certificate Authority (CA) certs into
  a single file, e.g. `cat ca1-cert.pem ca2-cert.pem > ca-cert.pem`

#### Perfect forward secrecy[#](#perfect-forward-secrecy)

The term *[forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy)* or *perfect forward secrecy* describes a feature
of key-agreement (i.e., key-exchange) methods. That is, the server and client
keys are used to negotiate new temporary keys that are used specifically and
only for the current communication session. Practically, this means that even
if the server's private key is compromised, communication can only be decrypted
by eavesdroppers if the attacker manages to obtain the key-pair specifically
generated for the session.

Perfect forward secrecy is achieved by randomly generating a key pair for
key-agreement on every TLS/SSL handshake (in contrast to using the same key for
all sessions). Methods implementing this technique are called "ephemeral".

Currently two methods are commonly used to achieve perfect forward secrecy (note
the character "E" appended to the traditional abbreviations):

* [ECDHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman): An ephemeral version of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
  key-agreement protocol.
* [DHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange): An ephemeral version of the Diffie-Hellman key-agreement protocol.

Perfect forward secrecy using ECDHE is enabled by default. The `ecdhCurve`
option can be used when creating a TLS server to customize the list of supported
ECDH curves to use. See [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener) for more info.

DHE is disabled by default but can be enabled alongside ECDHE by setting the
`dhparam` option to `'auto'`. Custom DHE parameters are also supported but
discouraged in favor of automatically selected, well-known parameters.

Perfect forward secrecy was optional up to TLSv1.2. As of TLSv1.3, (EC)DHE is
always used (with the exception of PSK-only connections).

#### ALPN and SNI[#](#alpn-and-sni)

ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension) and
SNI (Server Name Indication) are TLS handshake extensions:

* ALPN: Allows the use of one TLS server for multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTP/2)
* SNI: Allows the use of one TLS server for multiple hostnames with different
  certificates.

#### Pre-shared keys[#](#pre-shared-keys)

TLS-PSK support is available as an alternative to normal certificate-based
authentication. It uses a pre-shared key instead of certificates to
authenticate a TLS connection, providing mutual authentication.
TLS-PSK and public key infrastructure are not mutually exclusive. Clients and
servers can accommodate both, choosing either of them during the normal cipher
negotiation step.

TLS-PSK is only a good choice where means exist to securely share a
key with every connecting machine, so it does not replace the public key
infrastructure (PKI) for the majority of TLS uses.
The TLS-PSK implementation in OpenSSL has seen many security flaws in
recent years, mostly because it is used only by a minority of applications.
Please consider all alternative solutions before switching to PSK ciphers.
Upon generating PSK it is of critical importance to use sufficient entropy as
discussed in [RFC 4086](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4086). Deriving a shared secret from a password or other
low-entropy sources is not secure.

PSK ciphers are disabled by default, and using TLS-PSK thus requires explicitly
specifying a cipher suite with the `ciphers` option. The list of available
ciphers can be retrieved via `openssl ciphers -v 'PSK'`. All TLS 1.3
ciphers are eligible for PSK and can be retrieved via
`openssl ciphers -v -s -tls1_3 -psk`.
On the client connection, a custom `checkServerIdentity` should be passed
because the default one will fail in the absence of a certificate.

According to the [RFC 4279](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4279), PSK identities up to 128 bytes in length and
PSKs up to 64 bytes in length must be supported. As of OpenSSL 1.1.0
maximum identity size is 128 bytes, and maximum PSK length is 256 bytes.

The current implementation doesn't support asynchronous PSK callbacks due to the
limitations of the underlying OpenSSL API.

To use TLS-PSK, client and server must specify the `pskCallback` option,
a function that returns the PSK to use (which must be compatible with
the selected cipher's digest).

It will be called first on the client:

* hint: [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) optional message sent from the server to help the client
  decide which identity to use during negotiation.
  Always `null` if TLS 1.3 is used.
* Returns: [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) in the form
  `{ psk: <Buffer|TypedArray|DataView>, identity: <string> }` or `null`.

Then on the server:

* socket: [<tls.TLSSocket>](tls.html#class-tlstlssocket) the server socket instance, equivalent to `this`.
* identity: [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) identity parameter sent from the client.
* Returns: [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<TypedArray>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) | [<DataView>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) the PSK (or `null`).

A return value of `null` stops the negotiation process and sends an
`unknown_psk_identity` alert message to the other party.
If the server wishes to hide the fact that the PSK identity was not known,
the callback must provide some random data as `psk` to make the connection
fail with `decrypt_error` before negotiation is finished.

#### Client-initiated renegotiation attack mitigation[#](#client-initiated-renegotiation-attack-mitigation)

The TLS protocol allows clients to renegotiate certain aspects of the TLS
session. Unfortunately, session renegotiation requires a disproportionate amount
of server-side resources, making it a potential vector for denial-of-service
attacks.

To mitigate the risk, renegotiation is limited to three times every ten minutes.
An `'error'` event is emitted on the [`tls.TLSSocket`](#class-tlstlssocket) instance when this
threshold is exceeded. The limits are configurable:

* `tls.CLIENT_RENEG_LIMIT` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Specifies the number of renegotiation
  requests. **Default:** `3`.
* `tls.CLIENT_RENEG_WINDOW` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Specifies the time renegotiation window
  in seconds. **Default:** `600` (10 minutes).

The default renegotiation limits should not be modified without a full
understanding of the implications and risks.

TLSv1.3 does not support renegotiation.

#### Session resumption[#](#session-resumption)

Establishing a TLS session can be relatively slow. The process can be sped
up by saving and later reusing the session state. There are several mechanisms
to do so, discussed here from oldest to newest (and preferred).

##### Session identifiers[#](#session-identifiers)

Servers generate a unique ID for new connections and
send it to the client. Clients and servers save the session state. When
reconnecting, clients send the ID of their saved session state and if the server
also has the state for that ID, it can agree to use it. Otherwise, the server
will create a new session. See [RFC 2246](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt) for more information, page 23 and
30.

Resumption using session identifiers is supported by most web browsers when
making HTTPS requests.

For Node.js, clients wait for the [`'session'`](#event-session) event to get the session data,
and provide the data to the `session` option of a subsequent [`tls.connect()`](#tlsconnectoptions-callback)
to reuse the session. Servers must
implement handlers for the [`'newSession'`](#event-newsession) and [`'resumeSession'`](#event-resumesession) events
to save and restore the session data using the session ID as the lookup key to
reuse sessions. To reuse sessions across load balancers or cluster workers,
servers must use a shared session cache (such as Redis) in their session
handlers.

##### Session tickets[#](#session-tickets)

The servers encrypt the entire session state and send it
to the client as a "ticket". When reconnecting, the state is sent to the server
in the initial connection. This mechanism avoids the need for a server-side
session cache. If the server doesn't use the ticket, for any reason (failure
to decrypt it, it's too old, etc.), it will create a new session and send a new
ticket. See [RFC 5077](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077) for more information.

Resumption using session tickets is becoming commonly supported by many web
browsers when making HTTPS requests.

For Node.js, clients use the same APIs for resumption with session identifiers
as for resumption with session tickets. For debugging, if
[`tls.TLSSocket.getTLSTicket()`](#tlssocketgettlsticket) returns a value, the session data contains a
ticket, otherwise it contains client-side session state.

With TLSv1.3, be aware that multiple tickets may be sent by the server,
resulting in multiple `'session'` events, see [`'session'`](#event-session) for more
information.

Single process servers need no specific implementation to use session tickets.
To use session tickets across server restarts or load balancers, servers must
all have the same ticket keys. There are three 16-byte keys internally, but the
tls API exposes them as a single 48-byte buffer for convenience.

It's possible to get the ticket keys by calling [`server.getTicketKeys()`](#servergetticketkeys) on
one server instance and then distribute them, but it is more reasonable to
securely generate 48 bytes of secure random data and set them with the
`ticketKeys` option of [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener). The keys should be regularly
regenerated and server's keys can be reset with
[`server.setTicketKeys()`](#serversetticketkeyskeys).

Session ticket keys are cryptographic keys, and they ***must be stored
securely***. With TLS 1.2 and below, if they are compromised all sessions that
used tickets encrypted with them can be decrypted. They should not be stored
on disk, and they should be regenerated regularly.

If clients advertise support for tickets, the server will send them. The
server can disable tickets by supplying
`require('node:constants').SSL_OP_NO_TICKET` in `secureOptions`.

Both session identifiers and session tickets timeout, causing the server to
create new sessions. The timeout can be configured with the `sessionTimeout`
option of [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener).

For all the mechanisms, when resumption fails, servers will create new sessions.
Since failing to resume the session does not cause TLS/HTTPS connection
failures, it is easy to not notice unnecessarily poor TLS performance. The
OpenSSL CLI can be used to verify that servers are resuming sessions. Use the
`-reconnect` option to `openssl s_client`, for example:

```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -reconnect copy
```

Read through the debug output. The first connection should say "New", for
example:

```
New, TLSv1.2, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 copy
```

Subsequent connections should say "Reused", for example:

```
Reused, TLSv1.2, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 copy
```
### Modifying the default TLS cipher suite[#](#modifying-the-default-tls-cipher-suite)

Node.js is built with a default suite of enabled and disabled TLS ciphers. This
default cipher list can be configured when building Node.js to allow
distributions to provide their own default list.

The following command can be used to show the default cipher suite:

```
node -p crypto.constants.defaultCoreCipherList | tr ':' '\n'
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256
DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384
DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256
DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256
HIGH
!aNULL
!eNULL
!EXPORT
!DES
!RC4
!MD5
!PSK
!SRP
!CAMELLIA copy
```

This default can be replaced entirely using the [`--tls-cipher-list`](cli.html#--tls-cipher-listlist)
command-line switch (directly, or via the [`NODE_OPTIONS`](cli.html#node_optionsoptions) environment
variable). For instance, the following makes `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4`
the default TLS cipher suite:

```
node --tls-cipher-list='ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4' server.js

export NODE_OPTIONS=--tls-cipher-list='ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4'
node server.js copy
```

To verify, use the following command to show the set cipher list, note the
difference between `defaultCoreCipherList` and `defaultCipherList`:

```
node --tls-cipher-list='ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!RC4' -p crypto.constants.defaultCipherList | tr ':' '\n'
ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
!RC4 copy
```

i.e. the `defaultCoreCipherList` list is set at compilation time and the
`defaultCipherList` is set at runtime.

To modify the default cipher suites from within the runtime, modify the
`tls.DEFAULT_CIPHERS` variable, this must be performed before listening on any
sockets, it will not affect sockets already opened. For example:

```
// Remove Obsolete CBC Ciphers and RSA Key Exchange based Ciphers as they don't provide Forward Secrecy
tls.DEFAULT_CIPHERS +=
  ':!ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:!ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:!ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:!ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384' +
  ':!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384' +
  ':!kRSA'; copy
```

The default can also be replaced on a per client or server basis using the
`ciphers` option from [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions), which is also available
in [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener), [`tls.connect()`](#tlsconnectoptions-callback), and when creating new
[`tls.TLSSocket`](#class-tlstlssocket)s.

The ciphers list can contain a mixture of TLSv1.3 cipher suite names, the ones
that start with `'TLS_'`, and specifications for TLSv1.2 and below cipher
suites. The TLSv1.2 ciphers support a legacy specification format, consult
the OpenSSL [cipher list format](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT) documentation for details, but those
specifications do *not* apply to TLSv1.3 ciphers. The TLSv1.3 suites can only
be enabled by including their full name in the cipher list. They cannot, for
example, be enabled or disabled by using the legacy TLSv1.2 `'EECDH'` or
`'!EECDH'` specification.

Despite the relative order of TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2 cipher suites, the TLSv1.3
protocol is significantly more secure than TLSv1.2, and will always be chosen
over TLSv1.2 if the handshake indicates it is supported, and if any TLSv1.3
cipher suites are enabled.

The default cipher suite included within Node.js has been carefully
selected to reflect current security best practices and risk mitigation.
Changing the default cipher suite can have a significant impact on the security
of an application. The `--tls-cipher-list` switch and `ciphers` option should by
used only if absolutely necessary.

The default cipher suite prefers GCM ciphers for [Chrome's 'modern
cryptography' setting](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/education/tls#TOC-Cipher-Suites) and also prefers ECDHE and DHE ciphers for perfect
forward secrecy, while offering *some* backward compatibility.

Old clients that rely on insecure and deprecated RC4 or DES-based ciphers
(like Internet Explorer 6) cannot complete the handshaking process with
the default configuration. If these clients *must* be supported, the
[TLS recommendations](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) may offer a compatible cipher suite. For more details
on the format, see the OpenSSL [cipher list format](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT) documentation.

There are only five TLSv1.3 cipher suites:

* `'TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384'`
* `'TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256'`
* `'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'`
* `'TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256'`
* `'TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256'`

The first three are enabled by default. The two `CCM`-based suites are supported
by TLSv1.3 because they may be more performant on constrained systems, but they
are not enabled by default since they offer less security.

### OpenSSL security level[#](#openssl-security-level)

The OpenSSL library enforces security levels to control the minimum acceptable
level of security for cryptographic operations. OpenSSL's security levels range
from 0 to 5, with each level imposing stricter security requirements. The default
security level is 1, which is generally suitable for most modern applications.
However, some legacy features and protocols, such as TLSv1, require a lower
security level (`SECLEVEL=0`) to function properly. For more detailed information,
please refer to the [OpenSSL documentation on security levels](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR).

#### Setting security levels[#](#setting-security-levels)

To adjust the security level in your Node.js application, you can include `@SECLEVEL=X`
within a cipher string, where `X` is the desired security level. For example,
to set the security level to 0 while using the default OpenSSL cipher list, you could use:

```
import { createServer, connect } from 'node:tls';
const port = 443;

createServer({ ciphers: 'DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=0', minVersion: 'TLSv1' }, function(socket) {
  console.log('Client connected with protocol:', socket.getProtocol());
  socket.end();
  this.close();
})
.listen(port, () => {
  connect(port, { ciphers: 'DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=0', maxVersion: 'TLSv1' });
});const { createServer, connect } = require('node:tls');
const port = 443;

createServer({ ciphers: 'DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=0', minVersion: 'TLSv1' }, function(socket) {
  console.log('Client connected with protocol:', socket.getProtocol());
  socket.end();
  this.close();
})
.listen(port, () => {
  connect(port, { ciphers: 'DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=0', maxVersion: 'TLSv1' });
});copy
```

This approach sets the security level to 0, allowing the use of legacy features while still
leveraging the default OpenSSL ciphers.

#### Using [`--tls-cipher-list`](cli.html#--tls-cipher-listlist)[#](#using---tls-cipher-list)

You can also set the security level and ciphers from the command line using the
`--tls-cipher-list=DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=X` as described in [Modifying the default TLS cipher suite](#modifying-the-default-tls-cipher-suite).
However, it is generally discouraged to use the command line option for setting ciphers and it is
preferable to configure the ciphers for individual contexts within your application code,
as this approach provides finer control and reduces the risk of globally downgrading the security level.

### X509 certificate error codes[#](#x509-certificate-error-codes)

Multiple functions can fail due to certificate errors that are reported by
OpenSSL. In such a case, the function provides an [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) via its callback that
has the property `code` which can take one of the following values:

* `'UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT'`: Unable to get issuer certificate.
* `'UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL'`: Unable to get certificate CRL.
* `'UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CERT_SIGNATURE'`: Unable to decrypt certificate's
  signature.
* `'UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CRL_SIGNATURE'`: Unable to decrypt CRL's signature.
* `'UNABLE_TO_DECODE_ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY'`: Unable to decode issuer public key.
* `'CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE'`: Certificate signature failure.
* `'CRL_SIGNATURE_FAILURE'`: CRL signature failure.
* `'CERT_NOT_YET_VALID'`: Certificate is not yet valid.
* `'CERT_HAS_EXPIRED'`: Certificate has expired.
* `'CRL_NOT_YET_VALID'`: CRL is not yet valid.
* `'CRL_HAS_EXPIRED'`: CRL has expired.
* `'ERROR_IN_CERT_NOT_BEFORE_FIELD'`: Format error in certificate's notBefore
  field.
* `'ERROR_IN_CERT_NOT_AFTER_FIELD'`: Format error in certificate's notAfter
  field.
* `'ERROR_IN_CRL_LAST_UPDATE_FIELD'`: Format error in CRL's lastUpdate field.
* `'ERROR_IN_CRL_NEXT_UPDATE_FIELD'`: Format error in CRL's nextUpdate field.
* `'OUT_OF_MEM'`: Out of memory.
* `'DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT'`: Self signed certificate.
* `'SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN'`: Self signed certificate in certificate chain.
* `'UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY'`: Unable to get local issuer certificate.
* `'UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE'`: Unable to verify the first certificate.
* `'CERT_CHAIN_TOO_LONG'`: Certificate chain too long.
* `'CERT_REVOKED'`: Certificate revoked.
* `'INVALID_CA'`: Invalid CA certificate.
* `'PATH_LENGTH_EXCEEDED'`: Path length constraint exceeded.
* `'INVALID_PURPOSE'`: Unsupported certificate purpose.
* `'CERT_UNTRUSTED'`: Certificate not trusted.
* `'CERT_REJECTED'`: Certificate rejected.
* `'HOSTNAME_MISMATCH'`: Hostname mismatch.
### Class: `tls.CryptoStream`[#](#class-tlscryptostream)

Added in: v0.3.4Deprecated since: v0.11.3
[Stability: 0](documentation.html#stability-index) - Deprecated: Use [`tls.TLSSocket`](#class-tlstlssocket) instead.

The `tls.CryptoStream` class represents a stream of encrypted data. This class
is deprecated and should no longer be used.

#### `cryptoStream.bytesWritten`[#](#cryptostreambyteswritten)

Added in: v0.3.4Deprecated since: v0.11.3

The `cryptoStream.bytesWritten` property returns the total number of bytes
written to the underlying socket *including* the bytes required for the
implementation of the TLS protocol.

### Class: `tls.SecurePair`[#](#class-tlssecurepair)

Added in: v0.3.2Deprecated since: v0.11.3
[Stability: 0](documentation.html#stability-index) - Deprecated: Use [`tls.TLSSocket`](#class-tlstlssocket) instead.

Returned by [`tls.createSecurePair()`](#tlscreatesecurepaircontext-isserver-requestcert-rejectunauthorized-options).

#### Event: `'secure'`[#](#event-secure)

Added in: v0.3.2Deprecated since: v0.11.3

The `'secure'` event is emitted by the `SecurePair` object once a secure
connection has been established.

As with checking for the server
[`'secureConnection'`](#event-secureconnection)
event, `pair.cleartext.authorized` should be inspected to confirm whether the
certificate used is properly authorized.

### Class: `tls.Server`[#](#class-tlsserver)

Added in: v0.3.2

* Extends: [<net.Server>](net.html#class-netserver)

Accepts encrypted connections using TLS or SSL.

#### Event: `'connection'`[#](#event-connection)

Added in: v0.3.2

* `socket` [<stream.Duplex>](stream.html#class-streamduplex)

This event is emitted when a new TCP stream is established, before the TLS
handshake begins. `socket` is typically an object of type [`net.Socket`](net.html#class-netsocket) but
will not receive events unlike the socket created from the [`net.Server`](net.html#class-netserver)
`'connection'` event. Usually users will not want to access this event.

This event can also be explicitly emitted by users to inject connections
into the TLS server. In that case, any [`Duplex`](stream.html#class-streamduplex) stream can be passed.

#### Event: `'keylog'`[#](#event-keylog)

Added in: v12.3.0, v10.20.0

* `line` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) Line of ASCII text, in NSS `SSLKEYLOGFILE` format.
* `tlsSocket` [<tls.TLSSocket>](tls.html#class-tlstlssocket) The `tls.TLSSocket` instance on which it was
  generated.

The `keylog` event is emitted when key material is generated or received by
a connection to this server (typically before handshake has completed, but not
necessarily). This keying material can be stored for debugging, as it allows
captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. It may be emitted multiple times for
each socket.

A typical use case is to append received lines to a common text file, which
is later used by software (such as Wireshark) to decrypt the traffic:

```
const logFile = fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/ssl-keys.log', { flags: 'a' });
// ...
server.on('keylog', (line, tlsSocket) => {
  if (tlsSocket.remoteAddress !== '...')
    return; // Only log keys for a particular IP
  logFile.write(line);
}); copy
```
#### Event: `'newSession'`[#](#event-newsession)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v0.11.12 | The `callback` argument is now supported. |
| v0.9.2 | Added in: v0.9.2 |

The `'newSession'` event is emitted upon creation of a new TLS session. This may
be used to store sessions in external storage. The data should be provided to
the [`'resumeSession'`](#event-resumesession) callback.

The listener callback is passed three arguments when called:

* `sessionId` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) The TLS session identifier
* `sessionData` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) The TLS session data
* `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) A callback function taking no arguments that must be
  invoked in order for data to be sent or received over the secure connection.

Listening for this event will have an effect only on connections established
after the addition of the event listener.

#### Event: `'OCSPRequest'`[#](#event-ocsprequest)

Added in: v0.11.13

The `'OCSPRequest'` event is emitted when the client sends a certificate status
request. The listener callback is passed three arguments when called:

* `certificate` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) The server certificate
* `issuer` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) The issuer's certificate
* `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) A callback function that must be invoked to provide
  the results of the OCSP request.

The server's current certificate can be parsed to obtain the OCSP URL
and certificate ID; after obtaining an OCSP response, `callback(null, resp)` is
then invoked, where `resp` is a `Buffer` instance containing the OCSP response.
Both `certificate` and `issuer` are `Buffer` DER-representations of the
primary and issuer's certificates. These can be used to obtain the OCSP
certificate ID and OCSP endpoint URL.

Alternatively, `callback(null, null)` may be called, indicating that there was
no OCSP response.

Calling `callback(err)` will result in a `socket.destroy(err)` call.

The typical flow of an OCSP request is as follows:

1. Client connects to the server and sends an `'OCSPRequest'` (via the status
   info extension in ClientHello).
2. Server receives the request and emits the `'OCSPRequest'` event, calling the
   listener if registered.
3. Server extracts the OCSP URL from either the `certificate` or `issuer` and
   performs an [OCSP request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) to the CA.
4. Server receives `'OCSPResponse'` from the CA and sends it back to the client
   via the `callback` argument
5. Client validates the response and either destroys the socket or performs a
   handshake.

The `issuer` can be `null` if the certificate is either self-signed or the
issuer is not in the root certificates list. (An issuer may be provided
via the `ca` option when establishing the TLS connection.)

Listening for this event will have an effect only on connections established
after the addition of the event listener.

An npm module like [asn1.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asn1.js) may be used to parse the certificates.

#### Event: `'resumeSession'`[#](#event-resumesession)

Added in: v0.9.2

The `'resumeSession'` event is emitted when the client requests to resume a
previous TLS session. The listener callback is passed two arguments when
called:

* `sessionId` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) The TLS session identifier
* `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) A callback function to be called when the prior session
  has been recovered: `callback([err[, sessionData]])`
  + `err` [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)
  + `sessionData` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer)

The event listener should perform a lookup in external storage for the
`sessionData` saved by the [`'newSession'`](#event-newsession) event handler using the given
`sessionId`. If found, call `callback(null, sessionData)` to resume the session.
If not found, the session cannot be resumed. `callback()` must be called
without `sessionData` so that the handshake can continue and a new session can
be created. It is possible to call `callback(err)` to terminate the incoming
connection and destroy the socket.

Listening for this event will have an effect only on connections established
after the addition of the event listener.

The following illustrates resuming a TLS session:

```
const tlsSessionStore = {};
server.on('newSession', (id, data, cb) => {
  tlsSessionStore[id.toString('hex')] = data;
  cb();
});
server.on('resumeSession', (id, cb) => {
  cb(null, tlsSessionStore[id.toString('hex')] || null);
}); copy
```
#### Event: `'secureConnection'`[#](#event-secureconnection)

Added in: v0.3.2

The `'secureConnection'` event is emitted after the handshaking process for a
new connection has successfully completed. The listener callback is passed a
single argument when called:

* `tlsSocket` [<tls.TLSSocket>](tls.html#class-tlstlssocket) The established TLS socket.

The `tlsSocket.authorized` property is a `boolean` indicating whether the
client has been verified by one of the supplied Certificate Authorities for the
server. If `tlsSocket.authorized` is `false`, then `socket.authorizationError`
is set to describe how authorization failed. Depending on the settings
of the TLS server, unauthorized connections may still be accepted.

The `tlsSocket.alpnProtocol` property is a string that contains the selected
ALPN protocol. When ALPN has no selected protocol because the client or the
server did not send an ALPN extension, `tlsSocket.alpnProtocol` equals `false`.

The `tlsSocket.servername` property is a string containing the server name
requested via SNI.

#### Event: `'tlsClientError'`[#](#event-tlsclienterror)

Added in: v6.0.0

The `'tlsClientError'` event is emitted when an error occurs before a secure
connection is established. The listener callback is passed two arguments when
called:

* `exception` [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) The `Error` object describing the error
* `tlsSocket` [<tls.TLSSocket>](tls.html#class-tlstlssocket) The `tls.TLSSocket` instance from which the
  error originated.

#### `server.addContext(hostname, context)`[#](#serveraddcontexthostname-context)

Added in: v0.5.3

* `hostname` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) A SNI host name or wildcard (e.g. `'*'`)
* `context` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) | [<tls.SecureContext>](tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) An object containing any of the possible
  properties from the [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) `options` arguments
  (e.g. `key`, `cert`, `ca`, etc), or a TLS context object created with
  [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) itself.

The `server.addContext()` method adds a secure context that will be used if
the client request's SNI name matches the supplied `hostname` (or wildcard).

When there are multiple matching contexts, the most recently added one is
used.

#### `server.address()`[#](#serveraddress)

Added in: v0.6.0

* Returns: [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

Returns the bound address, the address family name, and port of the
server as reported by the operating system. See [`net.Server.address()`](net.html#serveraddress) for
more information.

#### `server.close([callback])`[#](#serverclosecallback)

Added in: v0.3.2

* `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) A listener callback that will be registered to listen
  for the server instance's `'close'` event.
* Returns: [<tls.Server>](tls.html#class-tlsserver)

The `server.close()` method stops the server from accepting new connections.

This function operates asynchronously. The `'close'` event will be emitted
when the server has no more open connections.

#### `server.getTicketKeys()`[#](#servergetticketkeys)

Added in: v3.0.0

* Returns: [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) A 48-byte buffer containing the session ticket keys.

Returns the session ticket keys.

See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.

#### `server.listen()`[#](#serverlisten)

Starts the server listening for encrypted connections.
This method is identical to [`server.listen()`](net.html#serverlisten) from [`net.Server`](net.html#class-netserver).

#### `server.setSecureContext(options)`[#](#serversetsecurecontextoptions)

Added in: v11.0.0

* `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) An object containing any of the possible properties from
  the [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) `options` arguments (e.g. `key`, `cert`,
  `ca`, etc).

The `server.setSecureContext()` method replaces the secure context of an
existing server. Existing connections to the server are not interrupted.

#### `server.setTicketKeys(keys)`[#](#serversetticketkeyskeys)

Added in: v3.0.0

* `keys` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<TypedArray>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) | [<DataView>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) A 48-byte buffer containing the session
  ticket keys.

Sets the session ticket keys.

Changes to the ticket keys are effective only for future server connections.
Existing or currently pending server connections will use the previous keys.

See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.

### Class: `tls.TLSSocket`[#](#class-tlstlssocket)

Added in: v0.11.4

* Extends: [<net.Socket>](net.html#class-netsocket)

Performs transparent encryption of written data and all required TLS
negotiation.

Instances of `tls.TLSSocket` implement the duplex [Stream](stream.html#stream) interface.

Methods that return TLS connection metadata (e.g.
[`tls.TLSSocket.getPeerCertificate()`](#tlssocketgetpeercertificatedetailed)) will only return data while the
connection is open.

#### `new tls.TLSSocket(socket[, options])`[#](#new-tlstlssocketsocket-options)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v12.2.0 | The `enableTrace` option is now supported. |
| v5.0.0 | ALPN options are supported now. |
| v0.11.4 | Added in: v0.11.4 |

* `socket` [<net.Socket>](net.html#class-netsocket) | [<stream.Duplex>](stream.html#class-streamduplex)
  On the server side, any `Duplex` stream. On the client side, any
  instance of [`net.Socket`](net.html#class-netsocket) (for generic `Duplex` stream support
  on the client side, [`tls.connect()`](#tlsconnectoptions-callback) must be used).
* `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
  + `enableTrace`: See [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener)
  + `isServer`: The SSL/TLS protocol is asymmetrical, TLSSockets must know if
    they are to behave as a server or a client. If `true` the TLS socket will be
    instantiated as a server. **Default:** `false`.
  + `server` [<net.Server>](net.html#class-netserver) A [`net.Server`](net.html#class-netserver) instance.
  + `requestCert`: Whether to authenticate the remote peer by requesting a
    certificate. Clients always request a server certificate. Servers
    (`isServer` is true) may set `requestCert` to true to request a client
    certificate.
  + `rejectUnauthorized`: See [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener)
  + `ALPNProtocols`: See [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener)
  + `SNICallback`: See [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener)
  + `session` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) A `Buffer` instance containing a TLS session.
  + `requestOCSP` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If `true`, specifies that the OCSP status request
    extension will be added to the client hello and an `'OCSPResponse'` event
    will be emitted on the socket before establishing a secure communication
  + `secureContext`: TLS context object created with
    [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions). If a `secureContext` is *not* provided, one
    will be created by passing the entire `options` object to
    `tls.createSecureContext()`.
  + ...: [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) options that are used if the
    `secureContext` option is missing. Otherwise, they are ignored.

Construct a new `tls.TLSSocket` object from an existing TCP socket.

#### Event: `'keylog'`[#](#event-keylog_1)

Added in: v12.3.0, v10.20.0

* `line` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) Line of ASCII text, in NSS `SSLKEYLOGFILE` format.

The `keylog` event is emitted on a `tls.TLSSocket` when key material
is generated or received by the socket. This keying material can be stored
for debugging, as it allows captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. It may
be emitted multiple times, before or after the handshake completes.

A typical use case is to append received lines to a common text file, which
is later used by software (such as Wireshark) to decrypt the traffic:

```
const logFile = fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/ssl-keys.log', { flags: 'a' });
// ...
tlsSocket.on('keylog', (line) => logFile.write(line)); copy
```
#### Event: `'OCSPResponse'`[#](#event-ocspresponse)

Added in: v0.11.13

The `'OCSPResponse'` event is emitted if the `requestOCSP` option was set
when the `tls.TLSSocket` was created and an OCSP response has been received.
The listener callback is passed a single argument when called:

* `response` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) The server's OCSP response

Typically, the `response` is a digitally signed object from the server's CA that
contains information about server's certificate revocation status.

#### Event: `'secureConnect'`[#](#event-secureconnect)

Added in: v0.11.4

The `'secureConnect'` event is emitted after the handshaking process for a new
connection has successfully completed. The listener callback will be called
regardless of whether or not the server's certificate has been authorized. It
is the client's responsibility to check the `tlsSocket.authorized` property to
determine if the server certificate was signed by one of the specified CAs. If
`tlsSocket.authorized === false`, then the error can be found by examining the
`tlsSocket.authorizationError` property. If ALPN was used, the
`tlsSocket.alpnProtocol` property can be checked to determine the negotiated
protocol.

The `'secureConnect'` event is not emitted when a [<tls.TLSSocket>](tls.html#class-tlstlssocket) is created
using the `new tls.TLSSocket()` constructor.

#### Event: `'session'`[#](#event-session)

Added in: v11.10.0

* `session` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer)

The `'session'` event is emitted on a client `tls.TLSSocket` when a new session
or TLS ticket is available. This may or may not be before the handshake is
complete, depending on the TLS protocol version that was negotiated. The event
is not emitted on the server, or if a new session was not created, for example,
when the connection was resumed. For some TLS protocol versions the event may be
emitted multiple times, in which case all the sessions can be used for
resumption.

On the client, the `session` can be provided to the `session` option of
[`tls.connect()`](#tlsconnectoptions-callback) to resume the connection.

See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.

For TLSv1.2 and below, [`tls.TLSSocket.getSession()`](#tlssocketgetsession) can be called once
the handshake is complete. For TLSv1.3, only ticket-based resumption is allowed
by the protocol, multiple tickets are sent, and the tickets aren't sent until
after the handshake completes. So it is necessary to wait for the
`'session'` event to get a resumable session. Applications
should use the `'session'` event instead of `getSession()` to ensure
they will work for all TLS versions. Applications that only expect to
get or use one session should listen for this event only once:

```
tlsSocket.once('session', (session) => {
  // The session can be used immediately or later.
  tls.connect({
    session: session,
    // Other connect options...
  });
}); copy
```
#### `tlsSocket.address()`[#](#tlssocketaddress)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v18.4.0 | The `family` property now returns a string instead of a number. |
| v18.0.0 | The `family` property now returns a number instead of a string. |
| v0.11.4 | Added in: v0.11.4 |

* Returns: [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

Returns the bound `address`, the address `family` name, and `port` of the
underlying socket as reported by the operating system:
`{ port: 12346, family: 'IPv4', address: '127.0.0.1' }`.

#### `tlsSocket.authorizationError`[#](#tlssocketauthorizationerror)

Added in: v0.11.4

Returns the reason why the peer's certificate was not been verified. This
property is set only when `tlsSocket.authorized === false`.

#### `tlsSocket.authorized`[#](#tlssocketauthorized)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

This property is `true` if the peer certificate was signed by one of the CAs
specified when creating the `tls.TLSSocket` instance, otherwise `false`.

#### `tlsSocket.disableRenegotiation()`[#](#tlssocketdisablerenegotiation)

Added in: v8.4.0

Disables TLS renegotiation for this `TLSSocket` instance. Once called, attempts
to renegotiate will trigger an `'error'` event on the `TLSSocket`.

#### `tlsSocket.enableTrace()`[#](#tlssocketenabletrace)

Added in: v12.2.0

When enabled, TLS packet trace information is written to `stderr`. This can be
used to debug TLS connection problems.

The format of the output is identical to the output of
`openssl s_client -trace` or `openssl s_server -trace`. While it is produced by
OpenSSL's `SSL_trace()` function, the format is undocumented, can change
without notice, and should not be relied on.

#### `tlsSocket.encrypted`[#](#tlssocketencrypted)

Added in: v0.11.4

Always returns `true`. This may be used to distinguish TLS sockets from regular
`net.Socket` instances.

#### `tlsSocket.exportKeyingMaterial(length, label[, context])`[#](#tlssocketexportkeyingmateriallength-label-context)

Added in: v13.10.0, v12.17.0

* `length` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) number of bytes to retrieve from keying material
* `label` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) an application specific label, typically this will be a
  value from the
  [IANA Exporter Label Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#exporter-labels).
* `context` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) Optionally provide a context.
* Returns: [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) requested bytes of the keying material

Keying material is used for validations to prevent different kind of attacks in
network protocols, for example in the specifications of IEEE 802.1X.

Example

```
const keyingMaterial = tlsSocket.exportKeyingMaterial(
  128,
  'client finished');

/*
 Example return value of keyingMaterial:
 <Buffer 76 26 af 99 c5 56 8e 42 09 91 ef 9f 93 cb ad 6c 7b 65 f8 53 f1 d8 d9

*/ copy
```

See the OpenSSL [`SSL_export_keying_material`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_export_keying_material.html) documentation for more
information.

#### `tlsSocket.getCertificate()`[#](#tlssocketgetcertificate)

Added in: v11.2.0

* Returns: [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

Returns an object representing the local certificate. The returned object has
some properties corresponding to the fields of the certificate.

See [`tls.TLSSocket.getPeerCertificate()`](#tlssocketgetpeercertificatedetailed) for an example of the certificate
structure.

If there is no local certificate, an empty object will be returned. If the
socket has been destroyed, `null` will be returned.

#### `tlsSocket.getCipher()`[#](#tlssocketgetcipher)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v13.4.0, v12.16.0 | Return the IETF cipher name as `standardName`. |
| v12.0.0 | Return the minimum cipher version, instead of a fixed string (`'TLSv1/SSLv3'`). |
| v0.11.4 | Added in: v0.11.4 |

* Returns: [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
  + `name` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) OpenSSL name for the cipher suite.
  + `standardName` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) IETF name for the cipher suite.
  + `version` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The minimum TLS protocol version supported by this cipher
    suite. For the actual negotiated protocol, see [`tls.TLSSocket.getProtocol()`](#tlssocketgetprotocol).

Returns an object containing information on the negotiated cipher suite.

For example, a TLSv1.2 protocol with AES256-SHA cipher:

```
{
    "name": "AES256-SHA",
    "standardName": "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA",
    "version": "SSLv3"
} copy
```

See
[SSL\_CIPHER\_get\_name](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CIPHER_get_name.html)
for more information.

#### `tlsSocket.getEphemeralKeyInfo()`[#](#tlssocketgetephemeralkeyinfo)

Added in: v5.0.0

* Returns: [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

Returns an object representing the type, name, and size of parameter of
an ephemeral key exchange in [perfect forward secrecy](#perfect-forward-secrecy) on a client
connection. It returns an empty object when the key exchange is not
ephemeral. As this is only supported on a client socket; `null` is returned
if called on a server socket. The supported types are `'DH'` and `'ECDH'`. The
`name` property is available only when type is `'ECDH'`.

For example: `{ type: 'ECDH', name: 'prime256v1', size: 256 }`.

#### `tlsSocket.getFinished()`[#](#tlssocketgetfinished)

Added in: v9.9.0

* Returns: [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<undefined>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Undefined_type) The latest `Finished` message that has been
  sent to the socket as part of a SSL/TLS handshake, or `undefined` if
  no `Finished` message has been sent yet.

As the `Finished` messages are message digests of the complete handshake
(with a total of 192 bits for TLS 1.0 and more for SSL 3.0), they can
be used for external authentication procedures when the authentication
provided by SSL/TLS is not desired or is not enough.

Corresponds to the `SSL_get_finished` routine in OpenSSL and may be used
to implement the `tls-unique` channel binding from [RFC 5929](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5929).

#### `tlsSocket.getPeerCertificate([detailed])`[#](#tlssocketgetpeercertificatedetailed)

Added in: v0.11.4

* `detailed` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Include the full certificate chain if `true`, otherwise
  include just the peer's certificate.
* Returns: [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) A certificate object.

Returns an object representing the peer's certificate. If the peer does not
provide a certificate, an empty object will be returned. If the socket has been
destroyed, `null` will be returned.

If the full certificate chain was requested, each certificate will include an
`issuerCertificate` property containing an object representing its issuer's
certificate.

##### Certificate object[#](#certificate-object)

  has one (not all well-known curves have been assigned names by NIST). Example:
  `'P-256'`.

#### `tlsSocket.getPeerFinished()`[#](#tlssocketgetpeerfinished)

Added in: v9.9.0

* Returns: [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<undefined>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Undefined_type) The latest `Finished` message that is expected
  or has actually been received from the socket as part of a SSL/TLS handshake,
  or `undefined` if there is no `Finished` message so far.

As the `Finished` messages are message digests of the complete handshake
(with a total of 192 bits for TLS 1.0 and more for SSL 3.0), they can
be used for external authentication procedures when the authentication
provided by SSL/TLS is not desired or is not enough.

Corresponds to the `SSL_get_peer_finished` routine in OpenSSL and may be used
to implement the `tls-unique` channel binding from [RFC 5929](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5929).

#### `tlsSocket.getPeerX509Certificate()`[#](#tlssocketgetpeerx509certificate)

Added in: v15.9.0

* Returns: [<X509Certificate>](crypto.html#class-x509certificate)

Returns the peer certificate as an [<X509Certificate>](crypto.html#class-x509certificate) object.

If there is no peer certificate, or the socket has been destroyed,
`undefined` will be returned.

#### `tlsSocket.getProtocol()`[#](#tlssocketgetprotocol)

Added in: v5.7.0

* Returns: [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<null>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Null_type)

Returns a string containing the negotiated SSL/TLS protocol version of the
current connection. The value `'unknown'` will be returned for connected
sockets that have not completed the handshaking process. The value `null` will
be returned for server sockets or disconnected client sockets.

Protocol versions are:

* `'SSLv3'`
* `'TLSv1'`
* `'TLSv1.1'`
* `'TLSv1.2'`
* `'TLSv1.3'`

See the OpenSSL [`SSL_get_version`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_get_version.html) documentation for more information.

#### `tlsSocket.getSession()`[#](#tlssocketgetsession)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer)

Returns the TLS session data or `undefined` if no session was
negotiated. On the client, the data can be provided to the `session` option of
[`tls.connect()`](#tlsconnectoptions-callback) to resume the connection. On the server, it may be useful
for debugging.

See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.

Note: `getSession()` works only for TLSv1.2 and below. For TLSv1.3, applications
must use the [`'session'`](#event-session) event (it also works for TLSv1.2 and below).

#### `tlsSocket.getSharedSigalgs()`[#](#tlssocketgetsharedsigalgs)

Added in: v12.11.0

* Returns: [<Array>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) List of signature algorithms shared between the server and
  the client in the order of decreasing preference.

See
[SSL\_get\_shared\_sigalgs](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_get_shared_sigalgs.html)
for more information.

#### `tlsSocket.getTLSTicket()`[#](#tlssocketgettlsticket)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer)

For a client, returns the TLS session ticket if one is available, or
`undefined`. For a server, always returns `undefined`.

It may be useful for debugging.

See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.

#### `tlsSocket.getX509Certificate()`[#](#tlssocketgetx509certificate)

Added in: v15.9.0

* Returns: [<X509Certificate>](crypto.html#class-x509certificate)

Returns the local certificate as an [<X509Certificate>](crypto.html#class-x509certificate) object.

If there is no local certificate, or the socket has been destroyed,
`undefined` will be returned.

#### `tlsSocket.isSessionReused()`[#](#tlssocketissessionreused)

Added in: v0.5.6

* Returns: [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) `true` if the session was reused, `false` otherwise.

See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.

#### `tlsSocket.localAddress`[#](#tlssocketlocaladdress)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

Returns the string representation of the local IP address.

#### `tlsSocket.localPort`[#](#tlssocketlocalport)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<integer>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type)

Returns the numeric representation of the local port.

#### `tlsSocket.remoteAddress`[#](#tlssocketremoteaddress)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

Returns the string representation of the remote IP address. For example,
`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`.

#### `tlsSocket.remoteFamily`[#](#tlssocketremotefamily)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

Returns the string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.

#### `tlsSocket.remotePort`[#](#tlssocketremoteport)

Added in: v0.11.4

* [<integer>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type)

Returns the numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `443`.

#### `tlsSocket.renegotiate(options, callback)`[#](#tlssocketrenegotiateoptions-callback)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v18.0.0 | Passing an invalid callback to the `callback` argument now throws `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` instead of `ERR_INVALID_CALLBACK`. |
| v0.11.8 | Added in: v0.11.8 |

* `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

  + `rejectUnauthorized` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If not `false`, the server certificate is
    verified against the list of supplied CAs. An `'error'` event is emitted if
    verification fails; `err.code` contains the OpenSSL error code. **Default:**
    `true`.
  + `requestCert`
* `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) If `renegotiate()` returned `true`, callback is
  attached once to the `'secure'` event. If `renegotiate()` returned `false`,
  `callback` will be called in the next tick with an error, unless the
  `tlsSocket` has been destroyed, in which case `callback` will not be called
  at all.
* Returns: [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) `true` if renegotiation was initiated, `false` otherwise.

The `tlsSocket.renegotiate()` method initiates a TLS renegotiation process.
Upon completion, the `callback` function will be passed a single argument
that is either an `Error` (if the request failed) or `null`.

This method can be used to request a peer's certificate after the secure
connection has been established.

When running as the server, the socket will be destroyed with an error after
`handshakeTimeout` timeout.

For TLSv1.3, renegotiation cannot be initiated, it is not supported by the
protocol.

#### `tlsSocket.setKeyCert(context)`[#](#tlssocketsetkeycertcontext)

Added in: v22.5.0, v20.17.0

* `context` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) | [<tls.SecureContext>](tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) An object containing at least `key` and
  `cert` properties from the [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) `options`, or a
  TLS context object created with [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) itself.

The `tlsSocket.setKeyCert()` method sets the private key and certificate to use
for the socket. This is mainly useful if you wish to select a server certificate
from a TLS server's `ALPNCallback`.

#### `tlsSocket.setMaxSendFragment(size)`[#](#tlssocketsetmaxsendfragmentsize)

Added in: v0.11.11

* `size` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) The maximum TLS fragment size. The maximum value is `16384`.
  **Default:** `16384`.
* Returns: [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

The `tlsSocket.setMaxSendFragment()` method sets the maximum TLS fragment size.
Returns `true` if setting the limit succeeded; `false` otherwise.

Smaller fragment sizes decrease the buffering latency on the client: larger
fragments are buffered by the TLS layer until the entire fragment is received
and its integrity is verified; large fragments can span multiple roundtrips
and their processing can be delayed due to packet loss or reordering. However,
smaller fragments add extra TLS framing bytes and CPU overhead, which may
decrease overall server throughput.

### `tls.checkServerIdentity(hostname, cert)`[#](#tlscheckserveridentityhostname-cert)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v17.3.1, v16.13.2, v14.18.3, v12.22.9 | Support for `uniformResourceIdentifier` subject alternative names has been disabled in response to CVE-2021-44531. |
| v0.8.4 | Added in: v0.8.4 |

* `hostname` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The host name or IP address to verify the certificate
  against.
* `cert` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) A [certificate object](#certificate-object) representing the peer's certificate.
* Returns: [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) | [<undefined>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Undefined_type)

Verifies the certificate `cert` is issued to `hostname`.

Returns [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object, populating it with `reason`, `host`, and `cert` on
failure. On success, returns [<undefined>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Undefined_type).

This function is intended to be used in combination with the
`checkServerIdentity` option that can be passed to [`tls.connect()`](#tlsconnectoptions-callback) and as
such operates on a [certificate object](#certificate-object). For other purposes, consider using
[`x509.checkHost()`](crypto.html#x509checkhostname-options) instead.

This function can be overwritten by providing an alternative function as the
`options.checkServerIdentity` option that is passed to `tls.connect()`. The
overwriting function can call `tls.checkServerIdentity()` of course, to augment
the checks done with additional verification.

This function is only called if the certificate passed all other checks, such as
being issued by trusted CA (`options.ca`).

Earlier versions of Node.js incorrectly accepted certificates for a given
`hostname` if a matching `uniformResourceIdentifier` subject alternative name
was present (see [CVE-2021-44531](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44531)). Applications that wish to accept
`uniformResourceIdentifier` subject alternative names can use a custom
`options.checkServerIdentity` function that implements the desired behavior.

### `tls.connect(options[, callback])`[#](#tlsconnectoptions-callback)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v15.1.0, v14.18.0 | Added `onread` option. |
| v14.1.0, v13.14.0 | The `highWaterMark` option is accepted now. |
| v13.6.0, v12.16.0 | The `pskCallback` option is now supported. |
| v12.9.0 | Support the `allowHalfOpen` option. |
| v12.4.0 | The `hints` option is now supported. |
| v12.2.0 | The `enableTrace` option is now supported. |
| v11.8.0, v10.16.0 | The `timeout` option is supported now. |
| v8.0.0 | The `lookup` option is supported now. |
| v8.0.0 | The `ALPNProtocols` option can be a `TypedArray` or `DataView` now. |
| v5.0.0 | ALPN options are supported now. |
| v5.3.0, v4.7.0 | The `secureContext` option is supported now. |
| v0.11.3 | Added in: v0.11.3 |

* `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
  + `enableTrace`: See [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener)
  + `host` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Host the client should connect to. **Default:**
    `'localhost'`.
  + `port` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Port the client should connect to.
  + `path` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Creates Unix socket connection to path. If this option is
    specified, `host` and `port` are ignored.
  + `socket` [<stream.Duplex>](stream.html#class-streamduplex) Establish secure connection on a given socket
    rather than creating a new socket. Typically, this is an instance of
    [`net.Socket`](net.html#class-netsocket), but any `Duplex` stream is allowed.
    If this option is specified, `path`, `host`, and `port` are ignored,
    except for certificate validation. Usually, a socket is already connected
    when passed to `tls.connect()`, but it can be connected later.
    Connection/disconnection/destruction of `socket` is the user's
    responsibility; calling `tls.connect()` will not cause `net.connect()` to be
    called.
  + `allowHalfOpen` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If set to `false`, then the socket will
    automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. If the
    `socket` option is set, this option has no effect. See the `allowHalfOpen`
    option of [`net.Socket`](net.html#class-netsocket) for details. **Default:** `false`.
  + `rejectUnauthorized` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If not `false`, the server certificate is
    verified against the list of supplied CAs. An `'error'` event is emitted if
    verification fails; `err.code` contains the OpenSSL error code. **Default:**
    `true`.
  + `pskCallback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) For TLS-PSK negotiation, see [Pre-shared keys](#pre-shared-keys).
  + `ALPNProtocols`: [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer[]>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<TypedArray[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) | [<DataView[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<TypedArray>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) | [<DataView>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView)
    An array of strings, `Buffer`s, `TypedArray`s, or `DataView`s, or a
    single `Buffer`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView` containing the supported ALPN
    protocols. `Buffer`s should have the format `[len][name][len][name]...`
    e.g. `'\x08http/1.1\x08http/1.0'`, where the `len` byte is the length of the
    next protocol name. Passing an array is usually much simpler, e.g.
    `['http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`. Protocols earlier in the list have higher
    preference than those later.
  + `servername`: [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS
    extension. It is the name of the host being connected to, and must be a host
    name, and not an IP address. It can be used by a multi-homed server to
    choose the correct certificate to present to the client, see the
    `SNICallback` option to [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener).
  + `checkServerIdentity(servername, cert)` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) A callback function
    to be used (instead of the builtin `tls.checkServerIdentity()` function)
    when checking the server's host name (or the provided `servername` when
    explicitly set) against the certificate. This should return an [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) if
    verification fails. The method should return `undefined` if the `servername`
    and `cert` are verified.
  + `session` [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) A `Buffer` instance, containing TLS session.
  + `minDHSize` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Minimum size of the DH parameter in bits to accept a
    TLS connection. When a server offers a DH parameter with a size less
    than `minDHSize`, the TLS connection is destroyed and an error is thrown.
    **Default:** `1024`.
  + `highWaterMark`: [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Consistent with the readable stream `highWaterMark` parameter.
    **Default:** `16 * 1024`.
  + `secureContext`: TLS context object created with
    [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions). If a `secureContext` is *not* provided, one
    will be created by passing the entire `options` object to
    `tls.createSecureContext()`.
  + `onread` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) If the `socket` option is missing, incoming data is
    stored in a single `buffer` and passed to the supplied `callback` when
    data arrives on the socket, otherwise the option is ignored. See the
    `onread` option of [`net.Socket`](net.html#class-netsocket) for details.
  + ...: [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) options that are used if the
    `secureContext` option is missing, otherwise they are ignored.
  + ...: Any [`socket.connect()`](net.html#socketconnectoptions-connectlistener) option not already listed.
* `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)
* Returns: [<tls.TLSSocket>](tls.html#class-tlstlssocket)

The `callback` function, if specified, will be added as a listener for the
[`'secureConnect'`](#event-secureconnect) event.

`tls.connect()` returns a [`tls.TLSSocket`](#class-tlstlssocket) object.

Unlike the `https` API, `tls.connect()` does not enable the
SNI (Server Name Indication) extension by default, which may cause some
servers to return an incorrect certificate or reject the connection
altogether. To enable SNI, set the `servername` option in addition
to `host`.

The following illustrates a client for the echo server example from
[`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener):

```
// Assumes an echo server that is listening on port 8000.
import { connect } from 'node:tls';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { stdin } from 'node:process';

const options = {
  // Necessary only if the server requires client certificate authentication.
  key: readFileSync('client-key.pem'),
  cert: readFileSync('client-cert.pem'),

  // Necessary only if the server uses a self-signed certificate.
  ca: [ readFileSync('server-cert.pem') ],

  // Necessary only if the server's cert isn't for "localhost".
  checkServerIdentity: () => { return null; },
};

const socket = connect(8000, options, () => {
  console.log('client connected',
              socket.authorized ? 'authorized' : 'unauthorized');
  stdin.pipe(socket);
  stdin.resume();
});
socket.setEncoding('utf8');
socket.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
socket.on('end', () => {
  console.log('server ends connection');
});// Assumes an echo server that is listening on port 8000.
const { connect } = require('node:tls');
const { readFileSync } = require('node:fs');

const options = {
  // Necessary only if the server requires client certificate authentication.
  key: readFileSync('client-key.pem'),
  cert: readFileSync('client-cert.pem'),

  // Necessary only if the server uses a self-signed certificate.
  ca: [ readFileSync('server-cert.pem') ],

  // Necessary only if the server's cert isn't for "localhost".
  checkServerIdentity: () => { return null; },
};

const socket = connect(8000, options, () => {
  console.log('client connected',
              socket.authorized ? 'authorized' : 'unauthorized');
  process.stdin.pipe(socket);
  process.stdin.resume();
});
socket.setEncoding('utf8');
socket.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
socket.on('end', () => {
  console.log('server ends connection');
});copy
```

To generate the certificate and key for this example, run:

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost' \
  -keyout client-key.pem -out client-cert.pem copy
```

Then, to generate the `server-cert.pem` certificate for this example, run:

```
openssl pkcs12 -certpbe AES-256-CBC -export -out server-cert.pem \
  -inkey client-key.pem -in client-cert.pem copy
```

* `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
  + `allowPartialTrustChain` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Treat intermediate (non-self-signed)
    certificates in the trust CA certificate list as trusted.
  + `ca` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<Buffer[]>](buffer.html#class-buffer) Optionally override the trusted CA
    certificates. Default is to trust the well-known CAs curated by Mozilla.
    Mozilla's CAs are completely replaced when CAs are explicitly specified
    using this option. The value can be a string or `Buffer`, or an `Array` of
    strings and/or `Buffer`s. Any string or `Buffer` can contain multiple PEM
    CAs concatenated together. The peer's certificate must be chainable to a CA
    trusted by the server for the connection to be authenticated. When using
    certificates that are not chainable to a well-known CA, the certificate's CA
    must be explicitly specified as a trusted or the connection will fail to
    authenticate.
    If the peer uses a certificate that doesn't match or chain to one of the
    default CAs, use the `ca` option to provide a CA certificate that the peer's
    certificate can match or chain to.
    For self-signed certificates, the certificate is its own CA, and must be
    provided.
    For PEM encoded certificates, supported types are "TRUSTED CERTIFICATE",
    "X509 CERTIFICATE", and "CERTIFICATE".
    See also [`tls.rootCertificates`](#tlsrootcertificates).
  + `cert` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<Buffer[]>](buffer.html#class-buffer) Cert chains in PEM format. One
    cert chain should be provided per private key. Each cert chain should
    consist of the PEM formatted certificate for a provided private `key`,
    followed by the PEM formatted intermediate certificates (if any), in order,
    and not including the root CA (the root CA must be pre-known to the peer,
    see `ca`). When providing multiple cert chains, they do not have to be in
    the same order as their private keys in `key`. If the intermediate
    certificates are not provided, the peer will not be able to validate the
    certificate, and the handshake will fail.
  + `sigalgs` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Colon-separated list of supported signature algorithms.
    The list can contain digest algorithms (`SHA256`, `MD5` etc.), public key
    algorithms (`RSA-PSS`, `ECDSA` etc.), combination of both (e.g
    'RSA+SHA384') or TLS v1.3 scheme names (e.g. `rsa_pss_pss_sha512`).
    See [OpenSSL man pages](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set1_sigalgs_list.html)
    for more info.
  + `ciphers` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Cipher suite specification, replacing the default. For
    more information, see [Modifying the default TLS cipher suite](#modifying-the-default-tls-cipher-suite). Permitted
    ciphers can be obtained via [`tls.getCiphers()`](#tlsgetciphers). Cipher names must be
    uppercased in order for OpenSSL to accept them.
  + `clientCertEngine` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Name of an OpenSSL engine which can provide the
    client certificate. **Deprecated.**
  + `crl` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<Buffer[]>](buffer.html#class-buffer) PEM formatted CRLs (Certificate
    Revocation Lists).
  + `dhparam` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) `'auto'` or custom Diffie-Hellman parameters,
    required for non-ECDHE [perfect forward secrecy](#perfect-forward-secrecy). If omitted or invalid,
    the parameters are silently discarded and DHE ciphers will not be available.
    [ECDHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)-based [perfect forward secrecy](#perfect-forward-secrecy) will still be available.
  + `ecdhCurve` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) A string describing a named curve or a colon separated
    list of curve NIDs or names, for example `P-521:P-384:P-256`, to use for
    ECDH key agreement. Set to `auto` to select the
    curve automatically. Use [`crypto.getCurves()`](crypto.html#cryptogetcurves) to obtain a list of
    available curve names. On recent releases, `openssl ecparam -list_curves`
    will also display the name and description of each available elliptic curve.
    **Default:** [`tls.DEFAULT_ECDH_CURVE`](#tlsdefault_ecdh_curve).
  + `honorCipherOrder` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Attempt to use the server's cipher suite
    preferences instead of the client's. When `true`, causes
    `SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE` to be set in `secureOptions`, see
    [OpenSSL Options](crypto.html#openssl-options) for more information.
  + `key` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<Buffer[]>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<Object[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) Private keys in PEM
    format. PEM allows the option of private keys being encrypted. Encrypted
    keys will be decrypted with `options.passphrase`. Multiple keys using
    different algorithms can be provided either as an array of unencrypted key
    strings or buffers, or an array of objects in the form
    `{pem: <string|buffer>[, passphrase: <string>]}`. The object form can only
    occur in an array. `object.passphrase` is optional. Encrypted keys will be
    decrypted with `object.passphrase` if provided, or `options.passphrase` if
    it is not.
  + `privateKeyEngine` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Name of an OpenSSL engine to get private key
    from. Should be used together with `privateKeyIdentifier`. **Deprecated.**
  + `privateKeyIdentifier` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Identifier of a private key managed by
    an OpenSSL engine. Should be used together with `privateKeyEngine`.
    Should not be set together with `key`, because both options define a
    private key in different ways. **Deprecated.**
  + `maxVersion` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Optionally set the maximum TLS version to allow. One
    of `'TLSv1.3'`, `'TLSv1.2'`, `'TLSv1.1'`, or `'TLSv1'`. Cannot be specified
    along with the `secureProtocol` option; use one or the other.
    **Default:** [`tls.DEFAULT_MAX_VERSION`](#tlsdefault_max_version).
  + `minVersion` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Optionally set the minimum TLS version to allow. One
    of `'TLSv1.3'`, `'TLSv1.2'`, `'TLSv1.1'`, or `'TLSv1'`. Cannot be specified
    along with the `secureProtocol` option; use one or the other. Avoid
    setting to less than TLSv1.2, but it may be required for
    interoperability. Versions before TLSv1.2 may require downgrading the [OpenSSL Security Level](#openssl-security-level).
    **Default:** [`tls.DEFAULT_MIN_VERSION`](#tlsdefault_min_version).
  + `passphrase` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Shared passphrase used for a single private key and/or
    a PFX.
  + `pfx` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<Buffer[]>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<Object[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) PFX or PKCS12 encoded
    private key and certificate chain. `pfx` is an alternative to providing
    `key` and `cert` individually. PFX is usually encrypted, if it is,
    `passphrase` will be used to decrypt it. Multiple PFX can be provided either
    as an array of unencrypted PFX buffers, or an array of objects in the form
    `{buf: <string|buffer>[, passphrase: <string>]}`. The object form can only
    occur in an array. `object.passphrase` is optional. Encrypted PFX will be
    decrypted with `object.passphrase` if provided, or `options.passphrase` if
    it is not.
  + `secureOptions` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Optionally affect the OpenSSL protocol behavior,
    which is not usually necessary. This should be used carefully if at all!
    Value is a numeric bitmask of the `SSL_OP_*` options from
    [OpenSSL Options](crypto.html#openssl-options).
  + `secureProtocol` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Legacy mechanism to select the TLS protocol
    version to use, it does not support independent control of the minimum and
    maximum version, and does not support limiting the protocol to TLSv1.3. Use
    `minVersion` and `maxVersion` instead. The possible values are listed as
    [SSL\_METHODS](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man7/ssl.html#Dealing-with-Protocol-Methods), use the function names as strings. For example,
    use `'TLSv1_1_method'` to force TLS version 1.1, or `'TLS_method'` to allow
    any TLS protocol version up to TLSv1.3. It is not recommended to use TLS
    versions less than 1.2, but it may be required for interoperability.
    **Default:** none, see `minVersion`.
  + `sessionIdContext` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Opaque identifier used by servers to ensure
    session state is not shared between applications. Unused by clients.
  + `ticketKeys`: [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) 48-bytes of cryptographically strong pseudorandom
    data. See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.
  + `sessionTimeout` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) The number of seconds after which a TLS session
    created by the server will no longer be resumable. See
    [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information. **Default:** `300`.

[`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener) sets the default value of the `honorCipherOrder` option
to `true`, other APIs that create secure contexts leave it unset.

[`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener) uses a 128 bit truncated SHA1 hash value generated
from `process.argv` as the default value of the `sessionIdContext` option, other
APIs that create secure contexts have no default value.

The `tls.createSecureContext()` method creates a `SecureContext` object. It is
usable as an argument to several `tls` APIs, such as [`server.addContext()`](#serveraddcontexthostname-context),
but has no public methods. The [`tls.Server`](#class-tlsserver) constructor and the
[`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener) method do not support the `secureContext` option.

A key is *required* for ciphers that use certificates. Either `key` or
`pfx` can be used to provide it.

If the `ca` option is not given, then Node.js will default to using
[Mozilla's publicly trusted list of CAs](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt).

Custom DHE parameters are discouraged in favor of the new `dhparam: 'auto'`
option. When set to `'auto'`, well-known DHE parameters of sufficient strength
will be selected automatically. Otherwise, if necessary, `openssl dhparam` can
be used to create custom parameters. The key length must be greater than or
equal to 1024 bits or else an error will be thrown. Although 1024 bits is
permissible, use 2048 bits or larger for stronger security.

* `context` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) A secure context object as returned by
  `tls.createSecureContext()`
* `isServer` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) `true` to specify that this TLS connection should be
  opened as a server.
* `requestCert` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) `true` to specify whether a server should request a
  certificate from a connecting client. Only applies when `isServer` is `true`.
* `rejectUnauthorized` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If not `false` a server automatically reject

  + `isServer`: If `true` the TLS socket will be instantiated in server-mode.
    **Default:** `false`.
  + `server` [<net.Server>](net.html#class-netserver) A [`net.Server`](net.html#class-netserver) instance
  + `requestCert`: See [`tls.createServer()`](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener)

    extension will be added to the client hello and an `'OCSPResponse'` event
    will be emitted on the socket before establishing a secure communication.

Creates a new secure pair object with two streams, one of which reads and writes
the encrypted data and the other of which reads and writes the cleartext data.
Generally, the encrypted stream is piped to/from an incoming encrypted data
stream and the cleartext one is used as a replacement for the initial encrypted
stream.

`tls.createSecurePair()` returns a `tls.SecurePair` object with `cleartext` and
`encrypted` stream properties.

Using `cleartext` has the same API as [`tls.TLSSocket`](#class-tlstlssocket).

The `tls.createSecurePair()` method is now deprecated in favor of
`tls.TLSSocket()`. For example, the code:

```
pair = tls.createSecurePair(/* ... */);
pair.encrypted.pipe(socket);
socket.pipe(pair.encrypted); copy
```

can be replaced by:

```
secureSocket = tls.TLSSocket(socket, options); copy
```

where `secureSocket` has the same API as `pair.cleartext`.

### `tls.createServer([options][, secureConnectionListener])`[#](#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v22.4.0, v20.16.0 | The `clientCertEngine` option depends on custom engine support in OpenSSL which is deprecated in OpenSSL 3. |
| v19.0.0 | If `ALPNProtocols` is set, incoming connections that send an ALPN extension with no supported protocols are terminated with a fatal `no_application_protocol` alert. |
| v20.4.0, v18.19.0 | The `options` parameter can now include `ALPNCallback`. |
| v12.3.0 | The `options` parameter now supports `net.createServer()` options. |
| v9.3.0 | The `options` parameter can now include `clientCertEngine`. |
| v8.0.0 | The `ALPNProtocols` option can be a `TypedArray` or `DataView` now. |
| v5.0.0 | ALPN options are supported now. |
| v0.3.2 | Added in: v0.3.2 |

* `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
  + `ALPNProtocols`: [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<Buffer[]>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<TypedArray[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) | [<DataView[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) | [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) | [<TypedArray>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) | [<DataView>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView)
    An array of strings, `Buffer`s, `TypedArray`s, or `DataView`s, or a single
    `Buffer`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView` containing the supported ALPN
    protocols. `Buffer`s should have the format `[len][name][len][name]...`
    e.g. `0x05hello0x05world`, where the first byte is the length of the next
    protocol name. Passing an array is usually much simpler, e.g.
    `['hello', 'world']`. (Protocols should be ordered by their priority.)
  + `ALPNCallback`: [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) If set, this will be called when a
    client opens a connection using the ALPN extension. One argument will
    be passed to the callback: an object containing `servername` and
    `protocols` fields, respectively containing the server name from
    the SNI extension (if any) and an array of ALPN protocol name strings. The
    callback must return either one of the strings listed in
    `protocols`, which will be returned to the client as the selected
    ALPN protocol, or `undefined`, to reject the connection with a fatal alert.
    If a string is returned that does not match one of the client's ALPN
    protocols, an error will be thrown. This option cannot be used with the
    `ALPNProtocols` option, and setting both options will throw an error.
  + `clientCertEngine` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) Name of an OpenSSL engine which can provide the
    client certificate. **Deprecated.**
  + `enableTrace` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If `true`, [`tls.TLSSocket.enableTrace()`](#tlssocketenabletrace) will be
    called on new connections. Tracing can be enabled after the secure
    connection is established, but this option must be used to trace the secure
    connection setup. **Default:** `false`.
  + `handshakeTimeout` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Abort the connection if the SSL/TLS handshake
    does not finish in the specified number of milliseconds.
    A `'tlsClientError'` is emitted on the `tls.Server` object whenever
    a handshake times out. **Default:** `120000` (120 seconds).
  + `rejectUnauthorized` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If not `false` the server will reject any
    connection which is not authorized with the list of supplied CAs. This
    option only has an effect if `requestCert` is `true`. **Default:** `true`.
  + `requestCert` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If `true` the server will request a certificate from
    clients that connect and attempt to verify that certificate. **Default:**
    `false`.
  + `sessionTimeout` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) The number of seconds after which a TLS session
    created by the server will no longer be resumable. See
    [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information. **Default:** `300`.
  + `SNICallback(servername, callback)` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) A function that will be
    called if the client supports SNI TLS extension. Two arguments will be
    passed when called: `servername` and `callback`. `callback` is an
    error-first callback that takes two optional arguments: `error` and `ctx`.
    `ctx`, if provided, is a `SecureContext` instance.
    [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) can be used to get a proper `SecureContext`.
    If `callback` is called with a falsy `ctx` argument, the default secure
    context of the server will be used. If `SNICallback` wasn't provided the
    default callback with high-level API will be used (see below).
  + `ticketKeys`: [<Buffer>](buffer.html#class-buffer) 48-bytes of cryptographically strong pseudorandom
    data. See [Session Resumption](#session-resumption) for more information.
  + `pskCallback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) For TLS-PSK negotiation, see [Pre-shared keys](#pre-shared-keys).
  + `pskIdentityHint` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) optional hint to send to a client to help
    with selecting the identity during TLS-PSK negotiation. Will be ignored
    in TLS 1.3. Upon failing to set pskIdentityHint `'tlsClientError'` will be
    emitted with `'ERR_TLS_PSK_SET_IDENTITY_HINT_FAILED'` code.
  + ...: Any [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) option can be provided. For
    servers, the identity options (`pfx`, `key`/`cert`, or `pskCallback`)
    are usually required.
  + ...: Any [`net.createServer()`](net.html#netcreateserveroptions-connectionlistener) option can be provided.
* `secureConnectionListener` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)
* Returns: [<tls.Server>](tls.html#class-tlsserver)

Creates a new [`tls.Server`](#class-tlsserver). The `secureConnectionListener`, if provided, is
automatically set as a listener for the [`'secureConnection'`](#event-secureconnection) event.

The `ticketKeys` options is automatically shared between `node:cluster` module
workers.

The following illustrates a simple echo server:

```
import { createServer } from 'node:tls';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const options = {
  key: readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
  cert: readFileSync('server-cert.pem'),

  // This is necessary only if using client certificate authentication.
  requestCert: true,

  // This is necessary only if the client uses a self-signed certificate.
  ca: [ readFileSync('client-cert.pem') ],
};

const server = createServer(options, (socket) => {
  console.log('server connected',
              socket.authorized ? 'authorized' : 'unauthorized');
  socket.write('welcome!\n');
  socket.setEncoding('utf8');
  socket.pipe(socket);
});
server.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log('server bound');
});const { createServer } = require('node:tls');
const { readFileSync } = require('node:fs');

const options = {
  key: readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
  cert: readFileSync('server-cert.pem'),

  // This is necessary only if using client certificate authentication.
  requestCert: true,

  // This is necessary only if the client uses a self-signed certificate.
  ca: [ readFileSync('client-cert.pem') ],
};

const server = createServer(options, (socket) => {
  console.log('server connected',
              socket.authorized ? 'authorized' : 'unauthorized');
  socket.write('welcome!\n');
  socket.setEncoding('utf8');
  socket.pipe(socket);
});
server.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log('server bound');
});copy
```

To generate the certificate and key for this example, run:

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost' \
  -keyout server-key.pem -out server-cert.pem copy
```

Then, to generate the `client-cert.pem` certificate for this example, run:

```
openssl pkcs12 -certpbe AES-256-CBC -export -out client-cert.pem \
  -inkey server-key.pem -in server-cert.pem copy
```

The server can be tested by connecting to it using the example client from
[`tls.connect()`](#tlsconnectoptions-callback).

### `tls.getCiphers()`[#](#tlsgetciphers)

Added in: v0.10.2

* Returns: [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

Returns an array with the names of the supported TLS ciphers. The names are
lower-case for historical reasons, but must be uppercased to be used in
the `ciphers` option of [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions).

Not all supported ciphers are enabled by default. See
[Modifying the default TLS cipher suite](#modifying-the-default-tls-cipher-suite).

Cipher names that start with `'tls_'` are for TLSv1.3, all the others are for
TLSv1.2 and below.

```
console.log(tls.getCiphers()); // ['aes128-gcm-sha256', 'aes128-sha', ...] copy
```
### `tls.rootCertificates`[#](#tlsrootcertificates)

Added in: v12.3.0

* [<string[]>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

An immutable array of strings representing the root certificates (in PEM format)
from the bundled Mozilla CA store as supplied by the current Node.js version.

The bundled CA store, as supplied by Node.js, is a snapshot of Mozilla CA store
that is fixed at release time. It is identical on all supported platforms.

### `tls.DEFAULT_ECDH_CURVE`[#](#tlsdefault_ecdh_curve)

History

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| v10.0.0 | Default value changed to `'auto'`. |
| v0.11.13 | Added in: v0.11.13 |

The default curve name to use for ECDH key agreement in a tls server. The
default value is `'auto'`. See [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions) for further
information.

### `tls.DEFAULT_MAX_VERSION`[#](#tlsdefault_max_version)

Added in: v11.4.0

* [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The default value of the `maxVersion` option of
  [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions). It can be assigned any of the supported TLS
  protocol versions, `'TLSv1.3'`, `'TLSv1.2'`, `'TLSv1.1'`, or `'TLSv1'`.
  **Default:** `'TLSv1.3'`, unless changed using CLI options. Using
  `--tls-max-v1.2` sets the default to `'TLSv1.2'`. Using `--tls-max-v1.3` sets
  the default to `'TLSv1.3'`. If multiple of the options are provided, the
  highest maximum is used.
### `tls.DEFAULT_MIN_VERSION`[#](#tlsdefault_min_version)

Added in: v11.4.0

* [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The default value of the `minVersion` option of

  protocol versions, `'TLSv1.3'`, `'TLSv1.2'`, `'TLSv1.1'`, or `'TLSv1'`.
  Versions before TLSv1.2 may require downgrading the [OpenSSL Security Level](#openssl-security-level).
  **Default:** `'TLSv1.2'`, unless changed using CLI options. Using
  `--tls-min-v1.0` sets the default to `'TLSv1'`. Using `--tls-min-v1.1` sets
  the default to `'TLSv1.1'`. Using `--tls-min-v1.3` sets the default to
  `'TLSv1.3'`. If multiple of the options are provided, the lowest minimum is
  used.
### `tls.DEFAULT_CIPHERS`[#](#tlsdefault_ciphers)

Added in: v19.8.0, v18.16.0

* [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The default value of the `ciphers` option of
  [`tls.createSecureContext()`](#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions). It can be assigned any of the supported
  OpenSSL ciphers. Defaults to the content of
  `crypto.constants.defaultCoreCipherList`, unless changed using CLI options
  using `--tls-default-ciphers`.

#### Description

The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.

Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
the severity of this vulnerability is Low.

Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we’re aware of, either only “named
curves” are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can’t represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an “exotic”
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC\_GROUP\_new\_curve\_GF2m(), EC\_GROUP\_new\_from\_params(),
and various supporting BN\_GF2m\_\*() functions.

Applications working with “exotic” explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, …) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don’t perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain. So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL\_select\_next\_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL\_select\_next\_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL\_select\_next\_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client\_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client\_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a “no overlap”
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function is accidentally called with a
client\_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_free\_buffers may cause
memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL\_free\_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not
vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by
applications.

The SSL\_free\_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used
when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected
to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have
been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the
network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.
In this case calling SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though a record has only
been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has
been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of
this data. Again a call to SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though the buffer
is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check()
or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded
memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL\_OP\_NO\_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early\_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12\_parse(),
PKCS12\_unpack\_p7data(), PKCS12\_unpack\_p7encdata(), PKCS12\_unpack\_authsafes()
and PKCS12\_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME\_write\_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take
a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
with the ‘-pubin’ and ‘-check’ options on untrusted data.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.

Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_generate\_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications
that use DH\_check\_pub\_key(), DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

While DH\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),
DH\_check\_pub\_key() doesn’t make any of these checks, and is therefore
vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.

Likewise, while DH\_generate\_key() performs a check for an excessively large
P, it doesn’t check for an excessively large Q.

An application that calls DH\_generate\_key() or DH\_check\_pub\_key() and
supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

DH\_generate\_key() and DH\_check\_pub\_key() are also called by a number of
other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other
functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this
are DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex(), EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check(), and EVP\_PKEY\_generate().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the
“-pubcheck” option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() or
EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() the provided OSSL\_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length,
via the “keylen” parameter or the IV length, via the “ivlen” parameter,
within the OSSL\_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST’s SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the
Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86\_64 processors supporting the
AVX512-IFMA instructions.

Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker
can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does
not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform
when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to
the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their
previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\_64 processors
supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so
the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,
if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent
calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD
cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using
OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of
any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we
consider this a Low severity security issue.

As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at
runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\_ia32cap:

OPENSSL\_ia32cap=:~0x200000

The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,
if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is
unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
The other functions affected by this are DH\_check\_ex() and
EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the “-check” option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those
checks confirms that the modulus (‘p’ parameter) is not too large. Trying to use
a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which
is over 10,000 bits in length.

However the DH\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters
that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value
even if it has already been found to be too large.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.

Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as
a consequence.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to
authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing,
adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL
implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.

The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
application has to call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP\_CipherUpdate()) with
NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call
instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
The empty data thus will not be authenticated.

As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and
we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or
data containing them may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ\_obj2txt() directly, or use any of
the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message
size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those
messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.

An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -
most of which have no size limit. OBJ\_obj2txt() may be used to translate
an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL
type ASN1\_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the
sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by
periods.

When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large
(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds
of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long
time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with ’n’ being the size of the
sub-identifiers in bytes (\*).

With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /
identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching
algorithms.

Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure
AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify
what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or
decrypt, or digest passed data.

Applications that call OBJ\_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are
affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose
of display, the severity is considered low.

In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,
CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509
certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.

The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a
100KiB limit on the peer’s certificate chain. Additionally, this only
impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
authentication.

In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,
such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way
that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered
not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
and the severity is therefore considered low.

Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM
platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,
leading to a crash.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM
platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually
used for disk encryption.

The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read
past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16
byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext
buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of
service.

If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue
a Low severity one.

The function X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was
decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy()
function.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate
policy check need to use X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_policies() or explicitly
enable the policy check by calling X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set\_flags() with
the X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK flag argument.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not
commonly used by applications.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be
vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by
OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.
A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies
in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.

The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS
enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading
the legacy provider.

PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
not call these functions however third party applications would be
affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
data.

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL\_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp as an ASN1\_TYPE rather than an
ASN1\_STRING.

When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network.

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() function. This will most likely lead
to an application crash. This function can be called on public
keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker
to cause a denial of service attack.

The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function
but applications might call the function if there are additional
security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the
d2i\_PKCS7(), d2i\_PKCS7\_bio() or d2i\_PKCS7\_fp() functions.

The result of the dereference is an application crash which could
lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL
does not call this function however third party applications might
call these functions on untrusted data.

The public API function BIO\_new\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
end user applications.

The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\_f\_asn1 filter
BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
to call BIO\_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
likely result in a crash.

This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\_write\_ASN1() which
may cause BIO\_new\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\_pop() on
the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
PEM\_write\_bio\_ASN1\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_CMS\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_PKCS7\_stream,
SMIME\_write\_ASN1, SMIME\_write\_CMS and SMIME\_write\_PKCS7.

Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
i2d\_ASN1\_bio\_stream, BIO\_new\_CMS, BIO\_new\_PKCS7, i2d\_CMS\_bio\_stream and
i2d\_PKCS7\_bio\_stream.

The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.

The function PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
decodes the “name” (e.g. “CERTIFICATE”), any header data and the payload data.
If the function succeeds then the “name\_out”, “header” and “data” arguments are
populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The
caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a
PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\_read\_bio\_ex()
will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer
to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer
then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM
files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.

The functions PEM\_read\_bio() and PEM\_read() are simple wrappers around
PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.

These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
functions including PEM\_X509\_INFO\_read\_bio\_ex() and
SSL\_CTX\_use\_serverinfo\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal
uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the
header argument if PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
include the PEM\_read\_bio\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in
OpenSSL 3.0.

The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker
would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for
decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an
encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a
sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
application data sent over that connection.

A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs
after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a
CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
to a trusted issuer.

The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to
a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure
of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext)
although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory
contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.

In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
client authentication and a malicious client connects.

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy
processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
to be a common setup.

Policy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy`
argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() and EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID\_undef as this value in the call to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). When NID\_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() using NID\_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86\_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86\_64 architecture are affected by this issue.

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasnât written. In the special case of âin placeâ encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.

In addition to the c\_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c\_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

The OPENSSL\_LH\_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common.

The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP\_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP\_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL âocspâ application. When verifying an ocsp response with the â-no\_cert\_checksâ option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.

The c\_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

The BN\_mod\_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN\_mod\_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022.

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021, and the release of 1.0.2zc on the 22nd of February 2022. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms.

Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509\_verify\_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL\_connect() or SSL\_do\_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL\_get\_error() to return the value SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL\_CTX\_set\_cert\_verify\_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY return value from SSL\_get\_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509\_verify\_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1\_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSLâs own âd2iâ functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1\_STRING\_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1\_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1\_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the âdataâ and âlengthâ fields in the ASN1\_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1\_STRING\_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1\_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1\_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the âdataâ field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1\_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509\_get1\_email(), X509\_REQ\_get1\_email() and X509\_get1\_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1\_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the âoutâ parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the âoutlenâ parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the âoutâ parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a âpurposeâ has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named âpurposeâ values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSLâs s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the â-crl\_downloadâ option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSLâs parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked.

The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue.

Server or client applications that call the SSL\_check\_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the âsignature\_algorithms\_certâ TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d.

In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS\_decrypt or PKCS7\_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt.

If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable ânon-stitchedâ ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted.

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the âprefix / âopenssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be â/usr/localâ. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of âC:/usr/localâ, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSLâs default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, â/usr/local/sslâ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own âprefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

There is an overflow bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN\_mod\_exp may be affected if they use BN\_FLG\_CONSTTIME.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL\_init\_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL\_INIT\_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used.

ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.

During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.

There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an âerror stateâ mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL\_do\_handshake(), SSL\_accept() and SSL\_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL\_read() or SSL\_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attackerâs direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

Applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.

This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a, released on 22nd September 2016. The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.

A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms. The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.

A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the âno-ocspâ build time option are not affected. Servers using OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in a default configuration, instead only if an application explicitly enables OCSP stapling support.

An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE\_MAX which is impractical on most platforms.

Because DES (and triple-DES) has only a 64-bit block size, birthday attacks are a real concern. For example, with the ability to run Javascript in a browser, it is possible to send enough traffic to cause a collision, and then use that information to recover something like a session Cookie. Triple-DES, which shows up as âDES-CBC3â in an OpenSSL cipher string, is still used on the Web, and major browsers are not yet willing to completely disable it. If you run a server, you should disable triple-DES. This is generally a configuration issue. If you run an old server that doesnât support any better ciphers than DES or RC4, you should upgrade. For 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, we removed the triple-DES ciphers from the âHIGHâ keyword and put them into âMEDIUM.â Note that we did not remove them from the âDEFAULTâ keyword. For the 1.1.0 release, we treat triple-DES just like we are treating RC4. It is not compiled by default; you have to use âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ as a config option. Even when those ciphers are compiled, triple-DES is only in the âMEDIUMâ keyword. In addition we also removed it from the âDEFAULTâ keyword.

The function BN\_bn2dec() does not check the return value of BN\_div\_word(). This can cause an OOB write if an application uses this function with an overly large BIGNUM. This could be a problem if an overly large certificate or CRL is printed out from an untrusted source. TLS is not affected because record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.

A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that arrive for future epochs update the replay protection âwindowâ before the MAC for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific DTLS connection.

In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simulataneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.

Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid side channel attacks.

Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: âp + len > limitâ Where âpâ points to some mallocâd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE âlenâ here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message). The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that âp + lenâ is only well defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour. For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for âpâ such that âp + lenâ actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len < limit.

This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of the bug was not known at the time. In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in i2c\_ASN1\_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create ânegative zeroesâ when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug. However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i\_ASN1\_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY structures. Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations. Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSLâs default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.

A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP\_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP\_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP\_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP\_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Internally to OpenSSL the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM\_write\_bio\* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM\_write\_bio\* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).

A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if theyâve not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time. Builds that are not configured with âenable-ssl2â will not support SSLv2. Even if âenable-ssl2â is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23\_method() will need to explicitly call either of: SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options(ctx, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); or SSL\_clear\_options(ssl, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2\_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured with âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ will not provide any âEXPORTâ or âLOWâ strength ciphers.

The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a â%sâ format string in the BIO\_\*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally the internal |doapr\_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT\_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long â%sâ format string. Memory leaks can also occur. The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

The SRP user database lookup method SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user had confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in constant time.

In the BN\_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value |i|. Later |bn\_expand| is called with a value of |i \* 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn\_expand| not allocating any memory because |i \* 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i \* 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN\_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.

If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation.

Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on âsafeâ primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be âsafeâ. Where an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not âsafeâ then an attacker could use this fact to find a peerâs private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS serverâs private DH exponent if itâs reusing the private DH exponent or itâs using a static DH ciphersuite. OpenSSL provides the option SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk. OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if: - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh() is used and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not set. - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used, and both the parameters and the key are set and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not used. This is an undocumted feature and parameter files donât contain the key. - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2. It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if: - SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is set - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used and the callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is almost always used like this. Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using: - genpkey with the dh\_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file including the prime-order subgroup size âqâ. This is supported since the 1.0.2 version. Older versions canât read files generated in this way. - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as requiring the single use. The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a âqâ parameter is available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. This could have some performance impact. Additionally the SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

Multiblock corrupted pointer. OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the âmultiblockâ performance improvement. This feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of âmultiblockâ can cause OpenSSLâs internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking IO. Typically, when the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connection.

OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature algorithm and signature encodings. OpenSSL also does not enforce a match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned portions of the certificate. By modifying the contents of the signature algorithm or the encoding of the signature, it is possible to change the certificateâs fingerprint. This does not allow an attacker to forge certificates, and does not affect certificate verification or OpenSSL servers/clients in any other way. It also does not affect common revocation mechanisms. Only custom applications that rely on the uniqueness of the fingerprint (e.g. certificate blacklists) may be affected.

Bignum squaring (BN\_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, including x86\_64. This bug occurs at random with a very low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been determined: \*) The probability of BN\_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. \*) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. \*) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected. \*) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.

* [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20031104.txt)

A flaw in OpenSSL 0.9.6k (only) would cause certain ASN.1 sequences to trigger a large recursion. On platforms such as Windows this large recursion cannot be handled correctly and so the bug causes OpenSSL to crash. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw if they can send arbitrary ASN.1 sequences which would cause OpenSSL to crash. This could be performed for example by sending a client certificate to a SSL/TLS enabled server which is configured to accept them.

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

# [R7] Nessus 6.9 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus is potentially impacted by several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (20160926) that were recently disclosed and fixed. Note that due to the time involved in doing a full analysis of each issue, Tenable has opted to upgrade the included version of OpenSSL as a precaution, and to save time. These vulnerabilities may impact Nessus and include:

* CVE-2016-6308 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6305 - OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6304 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6306 - OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* CVE-2016-6307 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6303 - OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* CVE-2016-6329 - Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* CVE-2016-6302 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2179 - OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2181 - OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2182 - OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* CVE-2016-2180 - OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* CVE-2016-2178 - OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* CVE-2016-2177 - OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* CVE-2016-6309 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* CVE-2016-7052 - OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS

Additionally, Nessus and Tenable's managed Nessus Cloud offering were found to be impacted by an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue reported to us by Noriaki Iwasaki (CVE-2016-9260). Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us and giving us time to resolve the issue. Tenable would also like to thank JPCERT/CC for the coordination of their advisory on this issue.

Notes and caveats:

1. Nessus Agents are not affected by these issues, as they do not act as an SSL server.
2. The CVSSv2 score reflects CVE-2016-6302 and other remote DoS issues.
3. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that Nessus be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus version 6.9 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), which is not affected, and addresses the XSS issue.

To update your Nessus installation, follow these steps:

* Download the appropriate installation file to the system hosting Nessus Professional or Nessus Manager, available at the Tenable Support Portal (<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=200>)
* Stop the Nessus service.
* Install according to your operating system procedures.
* Restart the Nessus service.
