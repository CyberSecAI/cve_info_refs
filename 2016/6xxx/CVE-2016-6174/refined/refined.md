{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user input passed through the `content_class` request parameter. This unsanitized input is used in a call to the `class_exists()` function in `/applications/core/modules/front/system/content.php`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized user input",
      "PHP code injection",
	  "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious `content_class` parameter in a HTTP request to the vulnerable script.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "exploit_details": "The exploit leverages an autoloading function in `/applications/cms/Application.php` which uses `eval()` to define a class based on user-controlled input. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code within the class definition.",
	"affected_versions": "IPS Community Suite versions 4.1.12.3 and prior are affected.",
	"solution": "Update to version 4.1.13 or later.",
	"poc": "A proof of concept URL is provided, demonstrating how to inject code using the `content_class` parameter: http://[host]/[ips]/index.php?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=cms\\Fields1{}phpinfo();/*",
    "php_version_dependency": "Successful exploitation requires the application to run on PHP versions prior to 5.4.24 or 5.5.8.",
