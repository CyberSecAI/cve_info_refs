Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-6299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `mock` package's `scm` plugin parsed a given spec file with root privileges. This parsing was done by the `rpm.ts.parseSpec()` function which executes with root privileges, thus allowing for the manipulation of the process and its privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows a user with limited privileges inside the mock environment to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Insecure Spec File Parsing:** The `scm` plugin parsed spec files with root privileges, creating a vulnerability where a malicious spec file could be used to escape the chroot and gain system-level access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Chroot Escape:** An attacker could craft a malicious spec file that, when parsed by the vulnerable `mock` plugin, would execute arbitrary code with root privileges, allowing the attacker to escape the chroot environment created by `mock`.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to a full system compromise, as the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Spec File:** The attack vector involves using a specially crafted spec file that exploits the vulnerable parsing mechanism.
*   **Triggering Mock Build:** The attacker needs the ability to initiate an rpm build within the `mock` environment using the crafted spec file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Limited Access within Mock:** The attacker needs to have the ability to initiate a build process within a `mock` environment.
*   **Crafting Spec File:** The attacker needs the skills to craft a malicious spec file that can trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the `scm.py` file of the `mock` package.
*   The issue was fixed by applying a patch to avoid parsing the spec file as root.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Martin Prpiƒç from Red Hat Product Security, and acknowledged by Florian Weimer.
*   Red Hat assigned bug number 1375490 to track this issue and issued security updates for Fedora 23, 24 and 25.
*   The fix involved modifying the plugin to not run the parsing with root permissions, thereby preventing the privilege escalation.
