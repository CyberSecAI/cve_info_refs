Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6809:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Apache Tika's MATLAB parser handles serialized Java objects embedded within MATLAB files. The parser uses native deserialization, which is inherently unsafe if not handled properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization of Java objects: The core issue is the native deserialization of Java objects. This is vulnerable to exploitation if the deserialized data is attacker-controlled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By crafting a malicious MATLAB file, an attacker can inject arbitrary code. When this file is parsed by a vulnerable version of Apache Tika, the injected code will be executed on the system processing the file.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious MATLAB file: The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted MATLAB file containing malicious serialized Java objects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify a MATLAB file: An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a MATLAB file to embed malicious serialized data.
- Ability to get victim to parse the malicious file: The attacker needs to get the victim to process the malicious MATLAB file with a vulnerable version of Apache Tika.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache Tika versions 1.6 to 1.13.
- The issue was discovered by Pierre Ernst of salesforce.com.
- Mitigation involves either upgrading to Tika 1.14 or disabling MATLAB file parsing.
