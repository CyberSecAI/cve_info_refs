Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) server functionality within Cisco IOS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to access data from a packet buffer that was previously used. This indicates a memory leak or improper handling of memory buffers.
- The information disclosure is due to the improper handling of the local name of a VPDN group during PPTP negotiations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can potentially access sensitive information contained in the packet buffer.
- The confidentiality of the system is partially compromised, as the attacker can potentially get access to data previously used.
- The impact is information disclosure only and does not affect integrity or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based and can be exploited remotely.
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable PPTP server.
- No special privileges or prior authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
- A workaround is available: configure a 64-character local name for any Virtual Private Dialup Network (VPDN) group enabled for PPTP. This prevents content from being leaked from the memory.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N), with a temporal score of 4.5
- The exploit is functional and confirmed.
