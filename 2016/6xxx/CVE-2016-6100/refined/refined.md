- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "notice confirmation" functionality in IBM Disposal and Governance Management for IT and IBM Global Retention Policy and Schedule Management is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can use CSRF to execute unauthorized actions by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into performing an action that they did not intend to. This can be achieved through social engineering.
