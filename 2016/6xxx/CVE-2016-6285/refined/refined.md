Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the `/includes/decorators/global-translations.jsp` file of Atlassian Jira Server. Specifically, the application directly incorporates the `Host` header from the HTTP request into the HTML response without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects the unsanitized `Host` header directly in the HTML response.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input, the `Host` header in this case, before incorporating it into the web page.
- **Cache Poisoning (Indirectly):** While not directly a cache poisoning vulnerability, the report mentions that the vulnerability is "somewhat hard to exploit but still doable when it comes to cache poisoning". This is because the XSS payload is reflected in a response that can be cached, potentially affecting other users accessing the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal the user's session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify data displayed on the page.
- **Phishing:**  The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious site disguised as the legitimate application.
- **Malware distribution:** The attacker can redirect to a site that distributes malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `/includes/decorators/global-translations.jsp` with a crafted XSS payload embedded within the `Host` header.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker would need to trick the user into visiting the crafted URL. This is especially true for cache poisoning related attacks, where a user might visit a cached page after the attacker poisoned it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Jira server.
- **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Headers:** The attacker must be able to modify the `Host` header within an HTTP request.
- **Some Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to induce the user to trigger the XSS by clicking a manipulated link.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Jira Server (6.0, 6.3, 6.4, 7.0.0, 7.1.0, 7.1.7 and archived Cloud versions).
- The vulnerability is fixed in Jira version 7.2.2.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" priority, but it's marked with "cvss-medium" which aligns with the nature of an XSS vulnerability.
- The issue is also present in Jira Cloud, reported as JRACLOUD-61888.
