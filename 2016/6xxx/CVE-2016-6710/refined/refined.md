{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the download manager due to the use of 'my_downloads' paths instead of 'all_downloads' paths when handling shared URIs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Inadequate access control"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application could bypass operating system protections designed to isolate application data, gaining access to download paths of other applications.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability by requesting access to download paths using the vulnerable download manager component.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device."
  },
  "additional_details": "The fix involves switching to the 'all_downloads' URI, which correctly applies permission grants to third-party apps, and issuing narrow grants towards the owner of each download both at device boot and when new downloads are started. This change prevents unauthorized access to download paths."
