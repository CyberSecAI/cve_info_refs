Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper parsing of user-supplied XML documents within the Hyper Management Module (HMM) of the Huawei E9000 Chassis. Specifically, it's an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the presence of an XXE vulnerability. This allows an attacker to control or inject external entities within an XML document, leading to the processing of these external entities by the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to:
    - Read arbitrary files from the system.
    - Cause a denial of service (DoS) of the web service by disrupting its normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the submission of maliciously crafted XML documents to the HMM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have normal user permissions on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to submit malicious XML documents to the vulnerable HMM interface.
