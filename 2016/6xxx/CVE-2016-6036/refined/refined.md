The provided content is related to CVE-2016-6036.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. This could alter the intended functionality and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web UI of the IBM Rational Quality Manager. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through user-supplied input fields or by other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a user of the affected application and have the ability to inject the malicious code into the web UI. This suggests the attacker requires at least a low-privileged user account. The attacker also needs to induce a different user to interact with the injected script.
