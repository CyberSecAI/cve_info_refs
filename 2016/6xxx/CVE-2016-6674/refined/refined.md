Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-6674:

**Root Cause:**
- An unspecified elevation of privilege vulnerability exists within the `system_server` component of the Android operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
- This is due to a flaw in how `system_server` handles certain operations, allowing for unauthorized code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker (a malicious application) to gain elevated capabilities, which are not normally accessible to third-party applications.
- This could potentially lead to a complete compromise of the device, giving the attacker control over sensitive data, system functions, and potentially persistent access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the malicious application needs to be installed on the device.
- No specific attack details are mentioned, but the vulnerability is within the `system_server` and the attack involves gaining unauthorized code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the targeted device.
- The attacker must also have the technical knowledge to craft an exploit that takes advantage of the vulnerability in `system_server`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The patch for this vulnerability is not publicly available. The fix is included in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices, available from the Google Developer site.
- This vulnerability is considered high severity as it provides access to elevated capabilities of the OS.
- The CVE is listed in the Android Security Bulletin for October 2016.
- The bulletin also notes that the vulnerability is addressed with the 2016-10-05 security patch level.
