Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `corewindow` parameter in Nagios. This parameter allows users to specify a URL, which is then used as the `src` attribute of an iframe embedded in Nagios web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `corewindow` parameter, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser when they access the Nagios interface.
*   **Phishing:** The ability to control the iframe's source allows an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious website that mimics the Nagios interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Deface the Nagios interface.
    *   Redirect the user to another website.
*   **Phishing:** By redirecting the user to a fake login page, an attacker could steal their credentials.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can potentially take advantage of concurrent cookies/sessions and perform CSRF attacks against other OpenStack components like Horizon, if they are open in the same browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that exploit the vulnerable `corewindow` parameter.
*   An attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious URL pointing to the Nagios instance. This could be done through phishing emails or other social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs.
*   The attacker needs to convince a target user to click on the malicious URL while logged into a vulnerable Nagios instance.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered due to the lack of proper input validation/sanitization of the `corewindow` parameter.
*   The provided example URL demonstrates the injection of a javascript payload:
    ```
    http://jdoe:jdoe@nagioscore.demos.nagios.com/nagios/index.php?corewindow=javascript://zz%0a;onload=alert(document.domain)//
    ```
*   The vulnerability is present on all Nagios pages.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was marked as "WONTFIX" in the provided Bugzilla report, suggesting that a fix may not be available.
