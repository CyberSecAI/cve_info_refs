Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an attempted use of an uninitialized pointer within the `dissect_nds_request` function in the NDS dissector of Wireshark.
- Specifically, a pointer variable `ptvc` is initialized to NULL at the start of the `dissect_nds_request` function. Under certain conditions, the code that would normally assign a valid memory address to `ptvc` is not executed. Consequently, the function attempts to free memory using the null pointer leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is the dereference of a null pointer (`ptvc`) when `ptvcursor_free()` is called.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the Wireshark application. This effectively denies the user the ability to analyze network traffic or packet capture files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a specially crafted (malformed) NDS packet onto the network, causing the vulnerable code path in Wireshark to be triggered.
- **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can create a malicious packet capture file containing a malformed NDS packet and then trick a user into opening it using Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either:
  - Inject malformed packets onto the network that is being monitored by Wireshark
  - Convince a Wireshark user to open a specially crafted capture file.
-  The attacker does not need any special access to the system or Wireshark itself.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using AFL (American Fuzzy Lop), a fuzzer tool.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.12
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark version 1.12.13.
- The affected code is located in `epan/dissectors/packet-ncp2222.inc`.
