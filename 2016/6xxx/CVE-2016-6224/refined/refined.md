  "CVE-2016-6224": {
    "description": "ecryptfs-setup-swap improperly configures encrypted swap when using GPT partitioning on a NVMe or MMC drive.",
    "extracted_information": {
      "root_cause": "The ecryptfs-setup-swap script fails to properly handle GPT swap partitions located on NVMe or MMC drives. Specifically, it doesn't mark these partitions as 'no-auto', causing them to be automatically mounted by systemd as unencrypted swap, while the intended encrypted swap is not used.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of GPT partitioned swap devices on NVMe/MMC drives.",
        "Failure to set the 'no-auto' flag on the unencrypted swap partition.",
        "Use of a regular expression that does not match NVMe or MMC device paths.",
        "Post-install script does not properly identify affected swap partitions on systems where the fix should apply (using /dev/sd* instead of /dev/nvme*n*p* or /dev/mmcblk*p*)"
      ],
      "impact": "Exposes sensitive information in unencrypted swap partition on systems configured to use encrypted swap.  This also causes a usability issue prompting users for a password to unlock their swap partition during boot and when installing packages.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system during boot or when a package is installed or upgraded",
        "Physical access to the device after it has been shutdown and left with an unencrypted swap partition"
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs only access to the physical device or local account access to install or update packages. A successful exploit can expose sensitive data stored in memory."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided information includes details on the patch, including the specific line changes in `src/utils/ecryptfs-setup-swap` that caused this vulnerability, along with details of the fix. The fix involves setting the no-auto flag to prevent systemd from automatically mounting the unencrypted partition, and fixes the regular expression used to identify NVMe and MMC drives."
