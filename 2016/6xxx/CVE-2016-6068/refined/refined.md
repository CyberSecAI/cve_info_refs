- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the way IBM UrbanCode Deploy handles access to secured role properties via API and CLI getResource endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control allows authenticated users with access to REST endpoints to retrieve secured role properties which they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with valid user credentials could gain unauthorized access to sensitive role properties, which could potentially lead to further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through network access to the vulnerable REST API endpoints or via CLI, using a valid user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a valid user account with access to the REST endpoints or CLI interface of the affected IBM UrbanCode Deploy instance.
