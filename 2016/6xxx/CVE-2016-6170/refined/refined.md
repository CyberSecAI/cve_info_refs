Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper restrictions on zone sizes during zone transfers in DNS server implementations. Specifically, BIND, NSD, knot DNS and PowerDNS were found to be vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Restriction of Zone Size:** DNS server implementations do not enforce reasonable limits on the size of zone data received during zone transfers (AXFR).
- This allows a malicious primary DNS server to send extremely large zone data to a secondary DNS server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious primary server can send oversized zone data to a secondary DNS server, causing the secondary server to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting service for other zones hosted on that server.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Secondary servers may experience resource exhaustion (e.g., disk space in /tmp) due to the transfer of large zone data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Primary DNS Server:** An attacker needs to control or compromise a primary DNS server that is explicitly configured to be a master for a zone.
- **Zone Transfer (AXFR):** The attack relies on the zone transfer mechanism where a secondary DNS server requests zone data from its primary server.
- **Lack of Zone Size Restrictions**: The vulnerability relies on the absence of proper restrictions on the size of zone data during transfer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have control over a primary DNS server.
- The attacker needs to be able to configure the primary server to serve an extremely large zone.
- The target must be a secondary DNS server configured to perform zone transfers (AXFR) from the attacker's malicious primary server.
- No authentication required.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple DNS server software, including BIND, NSD, knot DNS and PowerDNS.
- Patches have been proposed that introduce a new configuration option to limit the maximum size of zone data that a DNS server will accept during a transfer.
- The issue is considered an oversight in the DNS protocol itself, which does not specify size restrictions.

**Mitigation:**
- Configure the DNS server to reject zone transfers and dynamic updates from untrusted sources.
- Implement a patch that allows operators to set a limit on the maximum zone size accepted.
