However, for the convenience of operators who take zone data from untrusted sources (such as secondary name service providers) we have committed to delivering a feature in upcoming maintenance releases of BIND which will address the issue by allowing operators to set limits on the maximum zone size BIND will accept.

```
"CNAME chains should be followed and CNAME loops signalled as an error."
(RFC 1034, page 15).

that signaling is done at follow-time, which is not in the authority server.

Hi members,

I know wildcard can be setup for A,AAAA,MX etc.
But following this thread,
<http://serverfault.com/questions/44618/is-a-wildcard-cname-dns-record-valid>

wildcard seems should support CNAME too.

if I setup this:

*.example.com.  CNAME  wild.example.net.
*.example.com.  MX     mail.example.net.
www.example.com  A     192.168.1.100

When we query for "www.example.com A" or "www.example.com MX",  since
there are CNAME exists,they may get conflicted, we won't get the correct
result.

So we shouldn't setup wildcard for a CNAME. am I right?

Thanks.

```

Subject: Malicious primary DNS servers can crash secondaries

It turns out that most DNS server implementations do not implement
reasonable restrictions for zone sizes.  This allows an explicitly
configured primary DNS server for a zone to crash a secondary DNS
server, affecting service of other zones hosted on the same secondary
server.

Some references:

<https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2016-July/015058.html>
<https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2016-July/015075.html>
<https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/labs/knot/merge_requests/541>
<https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/bugs-script/show_bug.cgi?id=790>

PowerDNS is reportedly affected as well, but I did not find a public bug
for this issue.

Florian

$ patch -p1 < ../knot-1.6.5-xfer-limit-0.0.2.patch
$ ./configure <configure options>
$ make
$ su
# make install

```

Add `xfr-in-limit` to the zone options in knot.conf.
`xfr-in-limit` specifies the upper size limit(bytes) of received AXFR data.

```

$ ./configure <configure options>
$ make
$ su
# make install

```

Add `XFR-SIZE-LIMIT` to `domainmetadata`.
`XFR-SIZE-LIMIT` specifies the upper size limit(bytes) of received AXFR data.

```
mysql> select id from domains where name = 'example.com';
+----+
| id |
+----+
|  2 |
+----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into domainmetadata (domain_id, kind, content) values (2,'XFR-SIZE-LIMIT','10000000');

mysql> select * from domainmetadata;
+----+-----------+----------------+----------+
| id | domain_id | kind           | content  |
+----+-----------+----------------+----------+

If you are going to do size limits then you need to apply them to
AXFR, IXFR, and UPDATE as a minimum.  All of these can be used to
change the contents of a zone remotely.

That said a zone master is a trusted source even when it is a second
party.  It is easy to trace back misuse.

Basically it is a non-issue.  It's like disk quotas.  Usually more
pain than they are worth.
