Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6505:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a divide-by-zero error in the `dissect_pbb_tlvblock()` function located in `packet-packetbb.c`. Specifically at line 289.
- The variable 'c', calculated at line 285, can become zero under certain conditions. This leads to a division by zero when the expression `length / c` is evaluated at line 289.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Divide-by-zero error:** The core vulnerability is a classic divide-by-zero error, which leads to a crash.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code doesn't validate that the variable 'c' is not zero before performing the division.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the Wireshark application. This makes the application unusable until restarted, effectively leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed Packet Injection:** Attackers can inject a malformed packet containing specific PacketBB data onto the network.
- **Malformed Capture File:** Attackers can create or modify a capture file (pcap) containing the malicious PacketBB data and trick users into opening it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access (for live capture):** The attacker needs to be able to inject packets onto the network that is being captured by Wireshark.
- **Social Engineering (for capture files):** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious capture file.
- **Knowledge of PacketBB Protocol:** The attacker needs some understanding of the PacketBB protocol to craft a malformed packet that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using AFL (American Fuzzy Lop), a fuzzer.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.12 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.4.
- The issue is fixed in versions 1.12.13 and 2.0.5.
- A sample pcap file that triggers the vulnerability was provided.
