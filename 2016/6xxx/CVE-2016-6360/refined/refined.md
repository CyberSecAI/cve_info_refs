Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists within the Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) feature of Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) and Web Security Appliances (WSA). This vulnerability is triggered by a malformed JAR file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-119, which typically relates to buffer errors (e.g., improper memory management). Specifically, the processing of a malformed JAR file by the AMP process is causing the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Partial Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to the unexpected restart of the AMP process, causing a partial DoS condition. This likely means that the AMP service becomes temporarily unavailable, impacting its ability to perform its intended security function.
- Files Marked as Unscannable: Malformed JAR files may be marked as "UNSCANNABLE," meaning that they are not subjected to further malware analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending the malformed JAR file to an affected ESA or WSA.
- Network: The attack can be delivered over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated Access: The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any specific credentials on the targeted system.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable appliance.
- Malicious JAR file Creation: The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific malformed JAR file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Products: Cisco AsyncOS Software for Email Security Appliances (ESA) versions 9.5 and later up to the first fixed release and Cisco AsyncOS Software for Web Security Appliances (WSA) all versions prior to the first fixed release.
- No workarounds are available.
- The vulnerability was found during resolution of a support case.
- The vulnerability is related to how the AMP feature handles malformed JAR files.

This vulnerability is rated with a CVSS base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P), indicating a moderate severity with the main impact being availability loss.
