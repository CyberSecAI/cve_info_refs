| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers Fragmented Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160810-iosxr  First Published: 2016 August 10 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2016 August 10 16:27 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCux26791](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCux26791)     CVE-2016-6355        CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2016-6355        Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the driver processing functions of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on the route processor (RP) of an affected device, which could cause the device to drop all control-plane protocols and lead to a denial of service condition (DoS) on a targeted system.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 5.1.x, 5.2.x, and 5.3.x, prior to the first fixed release or applicable update for those releases, running on Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers. Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers are vulnerable by default if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software.      This vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted, fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets requiring reassembly to the IPv4 or IPv6 unicast address of any interface that is configured on an affected device. The vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic that is destined to an affected device. It cannot be triggered by traffic that is transiting an affected device.         **Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release**      To determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show version** command in the command-line interface (CLI). If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, **Cisco IOS XR Software** or similar text appears in the system banner. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the location of the system image file.      The following example shows the output of the **show version** command on a Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Router that is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.1.3:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router#show version      Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.1.3[Default]   Copyright (c) 2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 2.04(20140227:092320) [ASR9K ROMMON],     router uptime is 2 days, 12 hours, 2 minutes   System image file is "bootflash:disk0/asr9k-os-mbi-5.1.3.sp7-1.0.0/0x100000/mbiasr9k-rp.vm"   cisco ASR9K Series (P4040) processor with 8388608K bytes of memory.   P4040 processor at 1500MHz, Revision 2.0   ASR-9001 Chassis   .   .   .   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects only Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software.      Cisco has also confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco ASR 9006, ASR 9010, ASR 9904, ASR 9910, ASR 9912, or ASR 9922 Aggregation Services Routers. In addition, this vulnerability does not affect Cisco 12000 Series Routers, Cisco Carrier Routing System, Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 6000 Series Routers, Cisco NCS 5000 Series Routers, or Cisco NCS 4000 Series Routers that are running Cisco IOS XR Software.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a memory leak in the Software Packet Path (SPP) process on the RP of an affected device, which will cause the device to start dropping routing-protocol packets and management connections and may eventually cause the RP to reload. While experiencing these problems, all traffic that is destined to a device and, depending on the information learned from the routing protocols, all pass-through traffic will be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.      If a device is exploited, administrators can use the CLI to manually restart the SPP process on the RP, recover leaked buffers, and allow routing-protocol packets and management connections to build. The following example shows how to restart the SPP process and recover leaked buffers:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router#process restart spp location 0/rSP0/CPU0    Sun Jun 24 15:56:46.656 UTC   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Jun 24 15:56:46.709 : sysmgr_control[65747]: %OS-SYSMGR-4-PROC_RESTART_NAME : User root (con0_RSP0_CPU0)   requested a restart of process spp at 0/RSP0/CPU0      ```  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators can use an access control list (ACL) with the **fragments** keyword to configure an affected device to drop noninitial fragments. To avoid dropping valid fragmented traffic, implementation of this mitigation requires detailed knowledge of the network and careful configuration by a network administrator. For information about how the **fragments** keyword changes ACL behavior, see the [Access Control Lists and IP Fragments](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/8014-acl-wp.html) white paper.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>         Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.      **Customers Without Service Contracts**      Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>         Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.      **Fixed Releases**         This vulnerability has been corrected in Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.3 for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers.      This vulnerability has also been corrected in the following Software Maintenance Updates (SMUs) for Cisco IOS XR Software:   + asr9k-px-5.3.2.CSCux26791.pie for Releases 5.3.x   + asr9k-px-5.2.4.CSCux26791.pie for Releases 5.2.x   + asr9k-px-5.1.3.CSCux26791.pie for Releases 5.1.xNote that Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 6.0.x are not affected by this vulnerability.
