Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the driver processing functions of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers.
- Specifically, it's triggered when processing crafted, fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets that require reassembly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak in the Software Packet Path (SPP) process on the Route Processor (RP) when handling malformed fragmented packets.
- **Improper Packet Handling:** The software fails to adequately manage fragmented packets, leading to excessive memory consumption and, subsequently, a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause a memory leak which will result in the device dropping control-plane protocols, including routing and management connections, and may eventually cause the RP to reload. This leads to a DoS condition, where the device is unable to function normally.
- **Traffic Disruption:**  All traffic destined to the affected device will be dropped.  Pass-through traffic might also be dropped, depending on routing protocols.
- **Sustained DoS:** Repeated exploitation could lead to a sustained denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Crafted Fragmented Packets:** The attack vector involves sending specifically crafted, fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets to an affected device.
- **Destination-Specific:** The vulnerability is triggered by traffic destined to an interface configured on the affected device; transit traffic does not trigger it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted Cisco ASR 9001 router.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to generate and send crafted fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials.
