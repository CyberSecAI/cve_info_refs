{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "On wikis with the `$wgBlockDisablesLogin` setting enabled, user sessions were not terminated when an account was blocked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blocked users could retain access to the wiki for the duration of their login session, leading to unauthorized information access."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to wiki content by blocked users, potentially exposing private information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user with a previously established session could be blocked, but maintain access through that session.",
       "A blocked user could potentially access notification systems or other user specific data."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have a valid login session on a wiki with `$wgBlockDisablesLogin` set to true.",
      "The attacker must have their account blocked on that wiki."
    ],
    "additional_info": "The fix includes logging out the user upon blocking and also restricting permissions of blocked users to be similar to anonymous users (except in UserGetRights hook call)."
