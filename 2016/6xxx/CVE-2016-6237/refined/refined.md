Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a global buffer overflow vulnerability within the `build_huffcodes` function in `src/lepton/jpgcoder.cc`. This function is part of the JPEG decoding process in the Lepton image compression library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Global Buffer Overflow:** A write operation of size 2 bytes occurs outside of the allocated bounds of the `hcodes` global variable during the Huffman code construction within the `build_huffcodes` function. The write occurs 24 bytes before the `hcodes` global variable, overlapping the `htrees` variable, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow leads to memory corruption by overwriting adjacent global variables. This can cause unpredictable behavior including program crashes.
- **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption leads to a crash that can lead to denial of service.
- **Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities can, in some scenarios, be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflow and its consequences more precisely.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted JPEG Images:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JPEG image that exploits the parsing logic within the Lepton library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted JPEG file to an application using the vulnerable Lepton library. No specific privileges are mentioned to be needed. The attacker needs to have a position where their crafted JPEG will be processed by Lepton.
