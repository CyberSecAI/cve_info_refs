{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `pstm_exptmod()` function in MatrixSSL's bignum implementation does not correctly handle a base of zero in modular exponentiation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of edge cases in bignum arithmetic.",
      "Lack of input validation for modular exponentiation."
    ],
    "impact": "A crash due to an invalid free operation, leading to potential memory corruption. In the context of RSA key exchange, an attacker could send a base of zero, causing the server to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a zero value as the base during a modular exponentiation operation. This can be done by a malicious client during RSA key exchange by encrypting a zero value with the server's public key.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the base value of a modular exponentiation operation. This is possible during RSA key exchange where the client encrypts a secret using the server's public key; a malicious client can send zero instead."

  "cve": "CVE-2016-6885"
