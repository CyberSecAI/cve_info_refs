Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6350:

*   **Vulnerability Description:**

    The OpenBSD kernel is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Any user can trigger a kernel panic by using the `sysctl` call with a specific path.

*   **Root Cause:**

    When processing `sysctl` calls, the `vfs_sysctl()` function in OpenBSD performs a table lookup based on the second byte of the path.  If the path starts with (10,19), it selects the `tmpfs_vfsops` table and attempts to dispatch further processing through the `vfs_sysctl` method defined within that table. However, the `tmpfs_vfsops` table defines the `vfs_sysctl` method as `NULL`. Consequently, attempting to read or write to a `sysctl` path starting with (10,19) results in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a kernel panic with the message "attempt to execute user address 0x0 in supervisor mode".

*   **Vulnerability:**

    The vulnerability lies in the missing NULL pointer check in `vfs_sysctl()` before dispatching to the `vfs_sysctl` method and the NULL `vfs_sysctl` entry in the `tmpfs_vfsops` structure.

*   **Impact:**

    A local attacker can cause a denial-of-service (kernel panic), making the system unavailable.  There's also a theoretical possibility of privilege escalation if an attacker could map a page at address zero (which OpenBSD prevents by default) and bypass other security protections.

*   **Attack Vector:**

    A local attacker can execute the `sysctl` call with the specific path (10,19,0) to trigger the NULL pointer dereference.

*   **Required Capabilities:**

    Any logged-in user can exploit this vulnerability. No special privileges are required.

*   **Code Fix:**

    The fix involves adding a NULL-pointer check in `vfs_sysctl()` before dispatching to the `vfs_sysctl` method. Alternatively, a `vfs_sysctl` method could be implemented in the `tmpfs_vfsops` table.
