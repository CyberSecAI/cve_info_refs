Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6405

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Cisco Fog Director for IOx. It allows an attacker to write a file to arbitrary locations due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The primary weakness is the ability to write files to any location on the system. This is a direct consequence of improper handling of user-provided input, allowing them to specify the destination file path.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The root cause is the lack of proper validation of input, specifically the file path, allowing the attacker to specify any location within the system's file structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Compromise:** The most direct impact is the ability to modify system files or create new ones in arbitrary locations. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system's integrity.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the advisory explicitly mentions only the ability to write files, arbitrary file write vulnerabilities are often used as a stepping stone for further exploits, such as remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network, meaning the attacker does not require physical access to the device.
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely, which implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a different location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials to access the vulnerable service. This implies that the vulnerability is not exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco Fog Director service.

**Additional Details from the CVSS Calculator:**
- **CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:N)**
   - **Access Vector (AV): Network** -  The attack can be launched over a network.
   - **Access Complexity (AC): Medium** - The attack requires some level of sophistication.
    - **Authentication (Au): Single** - The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit.
    - **Confidentiality Impact (C): None** - There is no impact on confidentiality.
    - **Integrity Impact (I): Complete** - The attacker has complete control to modify system files.
    - **Availability Impact (A): None** -  There is no direct impact on availability.

- **CVSS v2 Temporal Score: 5.2 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**
   - **Exploitability (E): Functional** - Functional exploit code is available.
   - **Remediation Level (RL): Official Fix** - An official fix from the vendor is available.
   - **Report Confidence (RC): Confirmed** - The vulnerability has been confirmed by the vendor.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-6405 describes an arbitrary file write vulnerability in Cisco Fog Director for IOx. This vulnerability allows an authenticated remote attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the system, leading to potential integrity compromise and paving the way for further exploitation. The vulnerability has a network-based attack vector and requires valid user credentials. An official fix from the vendor is available.
