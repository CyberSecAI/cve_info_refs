Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6156

**Root Cause:** Double-fetch vulnerability in the `cros_ec_dev.c` driver. The driver fetches data from user space using `copy_from_user()` twice, and the size parameters (`u_cmd.outsize` and `u_cmd.insize`) might be changed between these two calls due to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Double Fetch:** The driver fetches the size parameters from user space twice without ensuring consistency between the fetches.
*   **Race Condition:** A malicious user-space program can potentially modify the size parameters between the two `copy_from_user()` calls.
*   **Insufficient Validation:** While some checks for maximum size limits are present, the driver does not check if the sizes are consistent across the two fetches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** If an attacker modifies the size parameters between the two fetches to a larger value, the kernel copies data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation/System Crash:** The buffer overflow can potentially corrupt kernel memory, leading to a privilege escalation or a system crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local User:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious program that uses the `ioctl` interface of the `cros_ec_dev.c` driver.
*   **Race Condition:** The attacker needs to exploit the race condition between the two `copy_from_user()` calls to change the size parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** Requires the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of the IOCTL interface:** The attacker needs to interact with the vulnerable driver via the ioctl interface.
*   **Ability to trigger the race condition:** The attacker needs to ensure that the size parameters are modified between the two fetches.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's `drivers/platform/chrome/cros_ec_dev.c` file.
*   The affected versions include Linux Kernel 4.6 and earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Pengfei Wang.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the size parameters are consistent between the two fetches.
*   The fix also ensures that if the size is reduced by `cros_ec_cmd_xfer()`, the smaller value is used to copy data back to user space.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by commit `096cdc6f52225835ff503f987a0d68ef770bb78e` in the Linux kernel.
