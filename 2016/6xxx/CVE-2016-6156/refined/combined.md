platform/chrome: cros\_ec\_dev - double fetch bug in ioctlWe verify "u\_cmd.outsize" and "u\_cmd.insize" but we need to make sure
that those values have not changed between the two copy\_from\_user()
calls. Otherwise it could lead to a buffer overflow.
Additionally, cros\_ec\_cmd\_xfer() can set s\_cmd->insize to a lower value.
We should use the new smaller value so we don't copy too much data to
the user.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=120131#c0)  Pengfei Wang    2016-06-13 16:00:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 219751](attachment.cgi?id=219751 "source files") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=219751&action=edit "source files") source files  Hi,  I found this double-fetch bug in Linux-4.6/drivers/platform/chrome/cros_ec_dev.c  when I was inspecting the source code.  In function ec_device_ioctl_xcmd(), the driver fetches user space data by pointer arg via copy_from_user(), and this happens twice at line 137 and line 145 respectively. The first fetched value (stored in u_cmd) is used to get the in_size and out_size elements and allocation a buffer (s_cmd) at line 140 so as to copy the whole message to driver later at line 145, which means the copy size of the whole message（s_cmd）is based on the old value (u_cmd.outside) that came from the first fetch. Besides, the whole message copied at the second fetch also contains the elements of in_size and out_size, which we call as the new values. The new values from the second fetch might be changed by another user thread under race condition, which will result in a double-fetch bug when the inconsistent values are used.  We can see this happening by tracking how the whole message from the second fetch is used. First of all, s_cmd is passed to cros_ec_cmd_xfer（）for further process at line 151. While within cros_ec_cmd_xfer（）（in file cros_ec_proto.c）, msg is firstly used for some validity checking, then again passed to function send_command() at line 377. Although msg->outsize and msg->insize are checked here, they are only checked for vialidity by comparing with some max values, rather than checking the consistency to prevent double-fetch bug. Then we step into send_command() at line 58 of file cros_ec_proto.c, and msg is passed to ec_dev->pkt_xfer(ec_dev, msg) and ec_dev->cmd_xfer(ec_dev, msg) respectively. These two are actually pointers to function cros_ec_pkt_xfer_i2c（）and cros_ec_cmd_xfer_i2c（）respectively.   In function cros_ec_cmd_xfer_i2c（）(line 187 of cros_ec_i2c.c), msg->outsize is used again  without checking to control a loop (line233), if msg->outsize is changed to a greater value than the original one, memory access msg->data[i] at line 234 will beyond array boundary. While for cros_ec_pkt_xfer_i2c(), things are similar, except the loop moves into cros_ec_prepare_tx() at line 98.  I noticed there were some checking during the tracking, however, the checking only compared the value with the max value, such as BUG_ON(msg->outsize > EC_PROTO2_MAX_PARAM_SIZE)，and this does not guarantee the consistency of the value. As long as the value is changed to a bigger value but not greater than the max value under race condition, problems still happen. When the message is switched to a longer one after the first fetch, only part of the message will be copied to the kernel by the second fetch based on the old value of size. However, when using the message, based on the size value of the new message, it would be used as a longer message, and memory access will beyond the array boundary.  I am looking forward to a reply to confirm this, thank you!  Kind regards Pengfei ``` |  |
