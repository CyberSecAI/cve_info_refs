## MatrixSSL contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#396440

Original Release Date: 2016-10-11 | Last Revised: 2016-10-14

---

### Overview

MatrixSSL, version 3.8.5 and earlier, contains heap overflow, out-of-bounds read, and unallocated memory free operation vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [**CWE-122**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)**: Heap-based Buffer Overflow** - CVE-2016-6890  The Subject Alt Name field of X.509 certificates is not properly parsed. A specially crafted certificate may result in a heap-based buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution.[**CWE-119**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** - CVE-2016-6891The ASN.1 Bit Field is not properly parsed. A specially crafted certificate may lead to a denial of service condition due to an out of bounds read in memory.[**CWE-590**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/590.html)**: Free of Memory not on the Heap** - CVE-2016-6892The x509FreeExtensions() function does not properly parse X.509 certificates. A specially crafted certificate may cause a free operation on unallocated memory, resulting in a denial of service condition.The CVSS score below describes CVE-2016-6890. For more information about these vulnerabilities, contact the vendor at support@matrixssl.com or refer to the [vendor release notes](https://github.com/matrixssl/matrixssl/blob/master/CHANGES.md) and the [researcher's blog](http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/flawed-matrixssl-code-highlights-need-for-better-iot-update-practices/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing a server to parse a specially crafted X.509 certificate, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to create a denial of service condition or execute arbitrary code in the context of the SSL stack. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor has released [version 3.8.6](http://www.matrixssl.org/blog/releases/matrixssl_3_8_6) to address these issues. Developers of embedded devices using MatrixSSL should provide firmware updates implementing the fix. Users in general should update to the latest release. |

# Flawed MatrixSSL Code Highlights Need for Better IoT Update Practices

SSL is a primary layer of defense on the Internet that makes it possible to have authenticated private conversations even over an untrusted network. Implementing a robust and secure SSL stack, however, is not trivial. Mistakes can lead to large attack surfaces, such as what we witnessed with OpenSSL when “[Heartbleed](/state-of-security)” was discovered. In the wake of “Heartbleed,” the security community had a number of very technical and public discussions surrounding coding practices and design choices made within various SSL stacks. The incident led many to recommend abandoning OpenSSL in favor of projects like NSS, GnuTLS and Polar SSL. In the case of devices, a common recommendation has been to use MatrixSSL with its super compact SSL/TLS stack designed specifically for [Internet of Things](/state-of-security/the-iot-convergence-how-it-and-ot-can-work-together-to-secure-the-internet-of-things "The IoT Convergence: How IT and OT Can Work Together to Secure the Internet of Things") (IoT) usage. A 2015 Internet-wide survey from SEC Consult’s 0-day research lab [identified more than 80,000 devices online using sample keys published within the MatrixSSL source repository](http://blog.sec-consult.com/2015/11/house-of-keys-industry-wide-https.html). Tens of thousands of other devices running MatrixSSL can also be found through the Shodan search engine, and an unknown but potentially massive number of additional devices are running within home networks without exposure to Internet-wide scans. The devices in question are very often network gateway devices like the WiMAX gateways or cable modems provided by Internet service providers, meaning a critical vulnerability in this code could expose a quite massive privacy incident. In the past year, well-known researchers Florian Weimer and Hanno Böck revealed dangerous crypto issues in MatrixSSL, including the ability to leak private key material. After some discussion of these flaws with Böck, I decided it would be worthwhile to take a look at the MatrixSSL X.509 certificate handling code for possible memory safety issues. To this end, I prepared an environment to conduct instrumented fuzz testing with the popular American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) tool from Google engineer and renowned security researcher Michal Zalewski. The targeted program’s state was monitored for changes in this process while data was manipulated. Within a matter of minutes, the testing produced results indicating memory safety issues, and before long, I had identified three distinct problems, including exploitable heap buffer overflow. **CVE-2016-6890** has been assigned to the buffer overflow, **CVE-2016-6891** has been assigned to a buffer over-read, and **CVE-2016-6892** is assigned to an improper free in x509FreeExtensions(). Systems using MatrixSSL to process untrusted X.509 certificates, such as what might happen if a certificate is sent for client authentication, could be prone to remote unauthenticated code execution in the context of the SSL stack. In the case of a router or other IoT devices, this almost certainly means an attacker could gain complete control of an affected system as the root user. Certain embedded device manufacturers making use of MatrixSSL should have been notified of the issue in September and should be releasing updates to affected products soon if they haven’t already. Vendors and individual consumers of MatrixSSL can obtain updated code from the Matrix SSL GitHub repository. The changes to fix these issues are included in the commit for release 3.8.6. In my opinion, these vulnerabilities should not discourage the use of MatrixSSL any more or less than Heartbleed should encourage users to stay away from OpenSSL. The bigger problem is designing systems that encourage good security practices, such as [regular patching](/state-of-security). Unfortunately, many devices running the vulnerable MatrixSSL code will likely never be updated to incorporate fixes. This is due to a combination of factors, including that many IoT device vendors fail to release updates to resolve security defects and most users will never install them unless the update is automatic. If you are reading this as a vendor, my advice is to focus on building devices with better update mechanisms and development practices to support quick delivery. Consumers, on the other hand, need to press vendors toward long-term support commitments for the embedded devices they buy.
