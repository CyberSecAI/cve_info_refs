Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6264:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `memset` function implementation for the ARM architecture within uClibc and uclibc-ng.
- The `BLT` instruction within the `memset` function uses *signed* comparisons when checking the length parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Signed vs. Unsigned Comparison:** The core issue is that the `memset` implementation uses signed comparisons for the length parameter, while the length should be treated as an unsigned value.
- **PC Register Control:** When a large negative value (interpreted as a large positive value due to the signed comparison) is provided as the length parameter, it leads to a large value being added to the Program Counter (PC) register, effectively allowing control of the execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can manipulate the PC register, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can be triggered with large negative values, causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Controlling Length Parameter:** The attack requires the ability to control the length parameter of the `memset` function. This implies that the vulnerable application must allow user-controlled length parameters to be used with `memset`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a manipulated length value to the vulnerable `memset` function, which implies having some level of interaction or control over program inputs.
- The attacker needs to target an application that is using the vulnerable `memset` implementation in uClibc or uclibc-ng on an ARM architecture.
- While the exploit is possible in theory, the provided text mentions the exploit being "a bit unrealistic" as it requires controlling memory chunks larger than 2GB

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is similar to CVE-2011-2702.
- A denial-of-service proof of concept is available.
- The vulnerability is fixed in uclibc-ng version 1.0.16 with a patch to use unsigned comparisons.
