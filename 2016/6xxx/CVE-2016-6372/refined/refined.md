Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-6372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure in the email filtering mechanism of Cisco AsyncOS software to properly handle malformed Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) headers. Specifically, the software does not correctly detect and process messages with duplicate MIME boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of malformed MIME headers, particularly those with duplicate boundaries.
- Inadequate validation and parsing of MIME structures.
- Bypass of configured message or content filters that should be scanning incoming attachments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass email filtering functionality on the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Web Security Appliance (WSA).
- Emails containing malicious attachments that should have been quarantined could instead be delivered and processed by the recipient.
- This can lead to malware infection, data breaches, or other security incidents.
- Could allow an attacker to deliver malicious content by avoiding content and attachment filtering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack through the sending of a specially crafted email with malformed MIME headers.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft emails with malformed MIME headers containing duplicate boundaries.
- Network connectivity to send the malicious email to the targeted Cisco ESA or WSA.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco WSA.
- It impacts both virtual and hardware appliances.
- The vulnerability affects systems configured with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments or services scanning content of web access.
- Cisco has provided a way to detect these messages using the 'Duplicate Boundaries Verification' content filter condition or the 'duplicate_boundaries' message filter rule.
- No workarounds were available, a software update is required.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is:
  - Base Score: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
  - Temporal Score: 4.8
- Exploitation is considered "Functional", meaning that functional exploit code was available at the time of the report.
