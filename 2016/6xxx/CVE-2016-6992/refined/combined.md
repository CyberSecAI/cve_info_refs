## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
