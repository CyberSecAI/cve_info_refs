OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

#### Description

statem/statem.c in OpenSSL 1.1.0a does not consider memory-block movement after a realloc call, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TLS session.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [22 Sep 2016]
========================================
OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth (CVE-2016-6304)
=====================================================================
Severity: High
A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension.
If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status
Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the
server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory
exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do
not support OCSP. Builds using the "no-ocsp" build time option are not affected.
Servers using OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in a default
configuration, instead only if an application explicitly enables OCSP stapling

OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0a
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 29th August 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL
development team.
SSL\_peek() hang on empty record (CVE-2016-6305)
===============================================
Severity: Moderate
OpenSSL 1.1.0 SSL/TLS will hang during a call to SSL\_peek() if the peer sends an
empty record. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial Of Service
attack.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0a
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 10th September 2016 by Alex Gaynor. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
SWEET32 Mitigation (CVE-2016-2183)
==================================
Severity: Low
SWEET32 (https://sweet32.info) is an attack on older block cipher algorithms
that use a block size of 64 bits. In mitigation for the SWEET32 attack DES based
ciphersuites have been moved from the HIGH cipherstring group to MEDIUM in
OpenSSL 1.0.1 and OpenSSL 1.0.2. OpenSSL 1.1.0 since release has had these
ciphersuites disabled by default.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 16th August 2016 by Karthikeyan
Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent (INRIA). The fix was developed by Rich Salz of the
OpenSSL development team.
OOB write in MDC2\_Update() (CVE-2016-6303)
==========================================
Severity: Low
An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or
through the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker
is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous
call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check
can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.
The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE\_MAX which is impractical
on most platforms.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 11th August 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team.
Malformed SHA512 ticket DoS (CVE-2016-6302)
===========================================
Severity: Low
If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a
DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will
ultimately crash.
The use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets is comparatively rare as it requires
a custom server callback and ticket lookup mechanism.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 19th August 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team.
OOB write in BN\_bn2dec() (CVE-2016-2182)
========================================
Severity: Low
The function BN\_bn2dec() does not check the return value of BN\_div\_word().
This can cause an OOB write if an application uses this function with an
overly large BIGNUM. This could be a problem if an overly large certificate
or CRL is printed out from an untrusted source. TLS is not affected because
record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 2nd August 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team.
OOB read in TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() (CVE-2016-2180)
==============================================
Severity: Low
The function TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() misuses OBJ\_obj2txt(): the return value is
the total length the OID text representation would use and not the amount
of data written. This will result in OOB reads when large OIDs are presented.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 21st July 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team.
Pointer arithmetic undefined behaviour (CVE-2016-2177)
======================================================
Severity: Low
Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic
A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner:
"p + len > limit"
Where "p" points to some malloc'd data of SIZE bytes and
limit == p + SIZE
"len" here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS
message).
The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that "p + len" is only well
defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually
undefined behaviour.
For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation
provides an address for "p" such that "p + len" actually overflows for
values of len that are too big and therefore p + len < limit.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 4th May 2016 by Guido Vranken. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing (CVE-2016-2178)
===============================================================
Severity: Low
Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to
avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that
a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been
demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to
recover the private DSA key.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 23rd May 2016 by CÃ©sar Pereida (Aalto
University), Billy Brumley (Tampere University of Technology), and Yuval Yarom
(The University of Adelaide and NICTA). The fix was developed by CÃ©sar Pereida.
DTLS buffered message DoS (CVE-2016-2179)
=========================================
Severity: Low
In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those
messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later
use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages
do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed.
An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when
they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS
connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore
the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By
opening many simulataneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack
through memory exhaustion.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd June 2016 by Quan Luo. The fix was
developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
DTLS replay protection DoS (CVE-2016-2181)
==========================================
Severity: Low
A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that
arrive for future epochs update the replay protection "window" before the MAC
for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by
sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a
valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent
legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific
DTLS connection.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 21st November 2015 by the OCAP audit team.
The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Certificate message OOB reads (CVE-2016-6306)
=============================================
Severity: Low
In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in
OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical
DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms.
The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and
server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against
a client or a server which enables client authentication.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd August 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team.
Excessive allocation of memory in tls\_get\_message\_header() (CVE-2016-6307)
==========================================================================
Severity: Low
A TLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message.
This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are
excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending
reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to
service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for
the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length
check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker
could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead
to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message
length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to
immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed
conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be
immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be
transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if:
1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the
event that the connection fails
or
2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there
is very little free memory
or
3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there
are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for
the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is
insufficient memory to service the multiple requests.
Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to
be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is
subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an
increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack
of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.
This issue does not affect DTLS users.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 TLS users should upgrade to 1.1.0a
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 18th September 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL
development team.
Excessive allocation of memory in dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() (CVE-2016-6308)
=============================================================================
Severity: Low
This issue is very similar to CVE-2016-6307. The underlying defect is different
but the security analysis and impacts are the same except that it impacts DTLS.
A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message.
This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are
excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending
reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to
service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for
the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length
check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker
could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead
to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message
length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to
immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed
conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be
immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be
transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if:
1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the
event that the connection fails
or
2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there
is very little free memory
or
3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there
are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for
the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is

be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is
subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an
increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack
of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.
This issue does not affect TLS users.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.1.0a
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 18th September 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team,
Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL
development team.

# [R3] PVS 5.2.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable's Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) uses third-party libraries to provide certain standardized functionality. Four of these libraries were found to contain vulnerabilities and were fixed upstream. Those fixes have been integrated despite there being no known exploitation scenarios related to PVS.

* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* SQLite Insecure Temporary Directory Usage Local Issue
* Expat XML Parser Input Document Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c XML\_GetBuffer() Function Compressed XML Content Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c generate\_hash\_secret\_salt() Function PRNG Non-random Output Generation Weakness
* Expat xmlparse.c Hash Table Collision DoS
* jQuery UI dialog() Function closeText Parameter XSS

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the OpenSSL integration into PVS and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact PVS at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that PVS be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

Additionally, a reflected XSS vulnerability affecting the PVS Web GUI was fixed in the HTML 1.7.1 and Web Server 1.8.0 updates delivered via the plugin feed on November 14, 2016. A default install of PVS 5.2.0 includes these fixes. This issue was reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

### Solution

Tenable has released version 5.2.0 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), jQuery UI (1.12.0), Expat (2.2.0), and SQLite (3.13.0), which are not affected. The new version is available at:

#### Description

A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection, curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing connections. This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.

#### Description

The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.

#### Description

OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, related to s3\_srvr.c, ssl\_sess.c, and t1\_lib.c.

# [R7] Nessus 6.9 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus is potentially impacted by several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (20160926) that were recently disclosed and fixed. Note that due to the time involved in doing a full analysis of each issue, Tenable has opted to upgrade the included version of OpenSSL as a precaution, and to save time. These vulnerabilities may impact Nessus and include:

* CVE-2016-6308 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6305 - OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6304 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6306 - OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* CVE-2016-6307 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6303 - OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* CVE-2016-6329 - Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* CVE-2016-6302 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2179 - OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2181 - OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2182 - OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* CVE-2016-2180 - OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* CVE-2016-2178 - OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* CVE-2016-2177 - OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* CVE-2016-6309 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* CVE-2016-7052 - OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS

Additionally, Nessus and Tenable's managed Nessus Cloud offering were found to be impacted by an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue reported to us by Noriaki Iwasaki (CVE-2016-9260). Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us and giving us time to resolve the issue. Tenable would also like to thank JPCERT/CC for the coordination of their advisory on this issue.

Notes and caveats:

1. Nessus Agents are not affected by these issues, as they do not act as an SSL server.
2. The CVSSv2 score reflects CVE-2016-6302 and other remote DoS issues.
3. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that Nessus be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus version 6.9 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), which is not affected, and addresses the XSS issue.

To update your Nessus installation, follow these steps:

* Download the appropriate installation file to the system hosting Nessus Professional or Nessus Manager, available at the Tenable Support Portal (<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=200>)
* Stop the Nessus service.
* Install according to your operating system procedures.
* Restart the Nessus service.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

While parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certiﬁcate, it is possible to do a one-byte
overread. This would result in an incorrect text display of the certiﬁcate. This bug has been present
since 2006 and is present in all versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6109

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display,
a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate
the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional ﬁles being transferred. This
affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6110

In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious
server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can manipulate the client output, for example to use ANSI
control codes to hide additional ﬁles being transferred.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

# [R2] LCE 4.8.2 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

LCE 4.8.1 is possibly impacted by multiple vulnerabilities reported in third-party libraries. Tenable has not investigated each one to determine if it is exploitable or the vulnerable code path can be reached. Instead, Dev has upgraded the impacted libraries as a faster and safer alternative. Due to the number of library upgrades and the potential for any of these issues to impact LCE users, we strongly encourage you to upgrade. In some cases, older versions than 4.8.0 may be impacted by a subset of these issues.

The following vulnerabilities have been resolved with the updated libraries. Note that several of these issues do not have a CVE assigned.

* SQLite ATTACH / DETACH Statement Handling NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* curl IDNA Puny Code Translation Incorrect Host Resolution Weakness
* curl tool\_urlglob.c Globbing Feature Out-of-bounds Access Issues
* curl lib/escape.c curl\_easy\_unescape() Function URL Unescape Integer Truncation Heap Buffer Overflow
* curl lib/url.c ConnectionExists() Function Connection Reuse Case-insensitive Password Comparison Remote Weakness
* curl lib/parsedate.c parsedate() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* curl lib/cookie.c Shared Cookies Handling Use-after-free Information Disclosure
* curl lib/mprintf.c alloc\_addbyter() Function Double-free DoS
* curl lib/url.c parseurlandfillconn() Function Authority Component Invalid URL Parsing Host Connection Issue
* curl lib/cookie.c Curl\_cookie\_init() Function Arbitrary Cookie Injection
* curl lib/security.c read\_data() Function Kerberos Authentication Handling Double-free Unspecified Issue
* curl lib/base64.c base64\_encode() Function Integer Overflow Heap Buffer Overflow
* curl lib/escape.c Multiple Functions String Length Handling Integer Overflow Heap Buffer Overflow
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the cURL / libcurl integration into LCE and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact LCE at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that LCE be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Log Correlation Engine (LCE) 4.8.2 has been released, which updates the linked OpenSSL, cURL / libcurl, and SQLite libraries. The new version [can be obtained on the Tenable Support Portal](https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=180).
