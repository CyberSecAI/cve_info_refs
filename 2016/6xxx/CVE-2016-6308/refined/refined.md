{
  "cve": "CVE-2016-6308",
  "description": "statem/statem_dtls.c in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allocates memory before checking for an excessive length, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted DTLS messages.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the logic of the DTLS implementation, where memory is allocated before checking for an excessive length. Specifically, the dtls1_preprocess_fragment() function in statem/statem_dtls.c allocates memory before performing the excessive message length check.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Denial of Service",
      "Memory exhaustion"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting available memory, leading to a crash or unresponsiveness of the affected server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote",
       "DTLS"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
       "Ability to send crafted DTLS messages"
   ],
  "additional_notes": [
    "This is a very similar issue to CVE-2016-6307, but the security impacts are the same and it impacts DTLS. Memory allocation happens before the check.",
    "The excessive memory allocation is transitory, and the memory is freed after connection failure, unless the application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner, it works in a constrained environment with little free memory, or the attacker initiates multiple connection attempts simultaneously.",
     "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted DTLS message with an excessive length."
