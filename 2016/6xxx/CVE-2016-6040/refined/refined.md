- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Session expiration is not properly enforced in IBM Jazz Foundation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  An authenticated user can take over a session of a previously logged-in user due to improper session expiration handling.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain access to the victim's account, leading to unauthorized access to data and functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the application, and needs to find an inactive/expired session.
