- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Operations Center is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to embed code in the Web UI. User interaction is required, as the malicious code would only execute when a different user views the crafted content.
