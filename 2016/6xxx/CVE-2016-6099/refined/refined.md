- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the product disclosing sensitive information to unauthorized users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The disclosed sensitive information can be used to mount further attacks on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based (AV:N). No specific attack vector is explicitly mentioned, but the network access vector suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges are needed (PR:N), and no user interaction is required (UI:N). An attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any authentication or user interaction.
