Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6245:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `ufs_getdents` system call, specifically in the `ufs_readdir` function.
- This function fails to properly limit the size of memory allocation when reading directory entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unbounded Memory Allocation:**  The `ufs_readdir` function does not have sufficient checks on the size of the memory allocation requested when reading directory entries.
- **Integer Overflow:** By providing an overly large size to the `getdents` system call, a user can trigger a large memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel Panic:** The excessive memory allocation leads to a "malloc: allocation too large" panic, crashing the system.
- **Denial of Service:** The kernel crash results in a denial of service, making the system unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `getdents` system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** Any local user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

A local user can cause a kernel panic in OpenBSD by calling the `getdents` syscall with an overly large size parameter. This triggers an unbounded memory allocation in `ufs_readdir`, which leads to either a "malloc: allocation too large" panic or an "out of space in kmem_map" panic, resulting in a denial of service.
