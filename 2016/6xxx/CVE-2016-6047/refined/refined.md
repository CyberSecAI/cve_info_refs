- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Jazz Reporting Service (JRS) web UI, which allows for the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session. The attacker can alter intended functionality of the web page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through the web interface by embedding malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to embed JavaScript code into the web UI, which typically requires some level of access or permission within the system.
