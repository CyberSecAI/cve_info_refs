- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure random number generation during the creation of self-signed certificates in Huawei products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient randomness in the generation of self-signed certificates. This could lead to the same random numbers being used across different devices, making their certificates vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could compromise device certificates and obtain their private keys by identifying and targeting devices with vulnerable certificates.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires collecting certificates from affected devices. Once collected, the attacker could use cryptanalysis techniques against the weak random number generation to compromise the certificates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to network traffic or device configurations, specifically the device certificates generated by Huawei products. The attacker needs expertise in cryptanalysis to exploit the weak randomness of certificate generation.
