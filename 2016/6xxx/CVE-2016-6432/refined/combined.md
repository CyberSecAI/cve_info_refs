| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco ASA Software Identity Firewall Feature Buffer Overflow Vulnerability Critical   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20161019-asa-idfw  First Published: 2016 October 19 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2016 October 19 17:59 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvb19843](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvb19843)     CVE-2016-6432     CWE-119       CVSS Score: [Base 9.3, Temporal 7.7](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2016-6432     CWE-119       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Identity Firewall feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code.  Affected Products  * Affected Cisco ASA Software running on the following products may be affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series/7600 Series ASA Services Module   + Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Cisco ASA for Firepower 9300 Series   + Cisco ASA for Firepower 4100 Series   + Cisco ISA 3000 Industrial Security Appliance   Refer to the "Fixed Software" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected releases.   Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured with the Identity Firewall feature and with NetBIOS probing enabled. To verify whether NetBIOS probing is enabled, use the **show running-config user-identity | include logout-probe** command and verify that the command returns output.      The following example shows a Cisco ASA with NetBIOS probing enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config user-identity | include logout-probeuser-identity logout-probe netbios local-system   ```    **Note:** The Cisco ASA Identity Firewall feature is enabled by default. However, NetBIOS probing is not.   Determining the Running Software Version   To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can use the **show version** command. The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco ASA Software version 9.2(1): ```   ciscoasa# show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ```    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software   version in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left   corner of the Cisco ASDM window.   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Threat Defense software.  Workarounds  * There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. Customers can disable NetBIOS probing in the ASA software by entering the following commands at the enable prompt:   ```   ciscoasa# configure terminalciscoasa(config)# no user-identity logout-probe netbios local-system   ```    When NetBIOS probing is not enabled, as in the default configuration, the ASA software relies on an idle timeout mechanism to remove user-to-IP address mapping entries. NetBIOS probing is used to proactively determine if a user has logged out of the network, allowing the ASA software to remove the user-to-IP address mapping more quickly than if idle timeout is the only mechanism used for this purpose.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>      Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.       In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.      **Customers Without Service Contracts**      Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):   [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd\_cisco\_worldwide\_contacts.html](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html%20)       Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.      In the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco   ASA Software. The right column indicates whether a major release is   affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.      | **Cisco ASA Major Release** | **First Fixed Release** |   | --- | --- |   | 7.21 | Not Affected |   | 8.01 | Not Affected |   | 8.11 | Not Affected |   | 8.21 | Not Affected |   | 8.31 | Not Affected |   | 8.41 | Affected; migrate to 9.1(7.11) or later |   | 8.51 | Affected; migrate to 9.1(7.11) or later |   | 8.61 | Affected; migrate to 9.1(7.11) or later |   | 8.71 | Affected; migrate to 9.1(7.11) or later |   | 9.0 | 9.0(4.42) or later |   | 9.1 | 9.1(7.11) or later |   | 9.2 | 9.2(4.17) or later |   | 9.3 | 9.3(3.11) or later |   | 9.4 | 9.4(3.11) or later |   | 9.5 | 9.5(3.1) or later |   | 9.6 | 9.6(2.1) or later |         1Cisco ASA Software releases 7.2, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7 have reached End of Software Maintenance.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.7 |
