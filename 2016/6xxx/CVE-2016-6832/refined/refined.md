Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `ff_audio_resample` function within `resample.c` of the libav library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability arises during memory copy operations (`__asan_memcpy`) within the `ff_audio_resample` function. The code attempts to write past the allocated memory buffer. Specifically, the ASan output shows a "WRITE of size 2" at an address right next to the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The heap-based buffer overflow can lead to a crash, as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer (ASan) output.
- It's implied that this could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A crafted audio/video file can trigger the vulnerability when processed by the `libav` library.
- Specifically, the `avconv` tool when used with a crafted input file triggers the vulnerability, leading to the crash during audio resampling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted audio/video file to a system using the vulnerable libav library.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges beyond what is required to process media files.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the libav API to craft a file that exploits the overflow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability does *not* affect ffmpeg.
- The bug was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- A similar issue was independently reported by nfxjfg on the libav bug tracker, but with a different overflow size (4 bytes instead of 2).
- The fix for the vulnerability is in libav version 11.4, with the fix available in the provided git commit.
