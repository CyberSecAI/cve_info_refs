Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6547:

**CVE-2016-6547:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Zizai Tech Nut mobile application stores the account password used to authenticate to the cloud API in cleartext within the `cache.db` file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cleartext Storage:**  Passwords are stored in an easily readable format, rather than being encrypted or hashed, on the local device.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credential Theft:** An attacker who gains access to the device's file system can retrieve the user's password.
    *   **Account Compromise:** The stolen password can be used to gain unauthorized access to the user's account on the associated cloud service.
    *   **Potential for Reuse:**  If the user reuses the password for other online services, those accounts may be at risk.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access:** An attacker needs physical access to the user's mobile device to access the `cache.db` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to access the file system of the user's mobile device. This could be achieved through malware, or physical access to the device itself.
