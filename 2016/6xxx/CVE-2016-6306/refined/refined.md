RELEVANT

Root cause of vulnerability:
The certificate parser in OpenSSL does not properly validate message length when parsing certificates, leading to out-of-bounds reads.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
Out-of-bounds reads.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, specifically application crashes due to memory corruption when parsing specially crafted certificate data.

Attack vectors:
- crafted TLS/SSL certificates
- specially crafted time-stamp files passed to the "openssl ts" command

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Remote network connection
- Ability to send crafted certificate data or time-stamp files.

More Details:
- The vulnerability affects the certificate parser in OpenSSL before 1.0.1u and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2i.
- The out-of-bounds reads occur in s3_clnt.c and s3_srvr.c.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafted certificate operations.
- Arista EOS and CloudVision eXchange products are also vulnerable to this issue.
- Tenable Nessus versions 6.8, 6.8.1, and 6.8.2 are also impacted.
- OpenSUSE compat-openssl098 is vulnerable, addressed in openSUSE-SU-2016:2537-1.
