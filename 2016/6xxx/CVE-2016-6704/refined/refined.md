Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a potential overflow issue within the Visualizer effect in the Android media framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process (Mediaserver). This would allow the malicious app to gain elevated capabilities not normally available to third-party apps.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** An attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the targeted device to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to install and execute a malicious application on the Android device. No specific network access is required. The attacker also needs a way to control the Visualizer effect parameters, likely via some API or code in their malicious app.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in AOSP versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, and 7.0.
*   The commit logs point to multiple fixes being integrated to address this issue.
*   The advisory mentions multiple commits related to the fix, suggesting the issue might be complex and require multiple fixes in different code locations.
