Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the SSL inspection mechanism of Cisco Firepower Management Center and Cisco FireSIGHT System software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The software fails to properly enforce "do-not-decrypt" rules defined in the SSL policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the configured SSL policy rules, specifically those intended to prevent decryption of certain traffic. This means encrypted traffic that should have been excluded from inspection might be improperly decrypted and potentially exposed.
- The impact is primarily an integrity issue since the attacker can influence which traffic is decrypted, not the availability or confidentiality directly (C:N/I:P/A:N)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote and does not require authentication.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic through a vulnerable Cisco Firepower Management Center or FireSIGHT System.
- No authentication is needed
- The attacker needs to be able to craft traffic that triggers the vulnerability to bypass the do-not-decrypt rule

**Additional Details**
- The exploit is considered functional.
- An official fix was available
- The vulnerability was confirmed by the vendor.
