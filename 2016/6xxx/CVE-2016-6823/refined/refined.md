Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- An arithmetic overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP coder of ImageMagick when calculating the image size by multiplying height and width.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer Overflow: The multiplication of image height and width can overflow, leading to an incorrect image size calculation.
- Out-of-Bounds Write: Due to the incorrect size calculation, a subsequent write operation can write outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Out-of-Bounds Write: Writing outside of allocated memory could lead to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Image Conversion: The vulnerability is triggered when converting other image formats (such as PPM) to BMP format.
- Crafted Input: An attacker can craft a malicious input image with specific height and width values that cause the arithmetic overflow in the BMP coder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide input to ImageMagick: An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted image file to ImageMagick. This can happen when a user converts images with `convert` utility.
- No specific system privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by pwchen of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab and RayZhong of Tencent's Keen Lab.
- Patches to address the vulnerability can be found in these commits:
   - <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/e7094d16cd8aee6bb48cf1d369f617f7edf89993>
   - <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/4cc6ec8a4197d4c008577127736bf7985d632323>
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2016-6823 and has been fixed in ImageMagick versions 6.8.9.9-5+deb8u4 and 6.9.5.9+dfsg-1.
- A proof of concept involves using `convert` to transform a specially crafted PPM image to a BMP image.
```
python -c 'print "P3\x0a14096\x201048576\x0a255\x00"' > PoC.ppm
convert PoC.ppm crash.bmp
```
