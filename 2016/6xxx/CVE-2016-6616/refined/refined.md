Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the "User group" designer feature of phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into queries executed by phpMyAdmin. The vulnerability is specifically in the context of the control user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the MySQL account of the control user configured in phpMyAdmin. This could potentially allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive data.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack is performed remotely via the web interface of phpMyAdmin.
*   **Specific Feature:** The vulnerable area is in the *User group* Designer feature.
*   **Control User Required:** The attack requires that phpMyAdmin be configured with a control user account in MySQL. If no control user is configured, the installation is not vulnerable to this specific issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to phpMyAdmin:** The attacker must have network access to the phpMyAdmin interface.
*   **Authenticated User (likely):** Although not explicitly mentioned in all sources, SQL injection vulnerabilities typically require some level of interaction, suggesting an authenticated user could exploit the vulnerable feature. The PMASA description doesn't explicitly state the authentication requirement, but it implies it since it mentions the SQL injection is against the account of the control user.
*   **Control User:** The target phpMyAdmin instance must have a control user set up and configured.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge of the SQL injection vulnerability to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information indicates this vulnerability was addressed in phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.4 and 4.4.15.8.
*   The vulnerability is considered serious.

The information provided goes into more detail than a basic CVE description might, particularly regarding the specific feature affected ("User group" Designer), the need for a control user account to be configured, and providing references to specific commits that fix the issue.
