Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of crafted, fragmented IKEv1 packets within the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) fragmentation code of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The software does not correctly validate or process fragmented IKEv1 packets.
- **Memory Exhaustion:**  The vulnerability can lead to an exhaustion of available memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service, either by exhausting the device's memory or triggering a system reload.
- **System Reload:** The device may reload or reboot due to the vulnerability, causing an interruption in service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based attack:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
- **Crafted UDP Packets:** The attacker sends crafted UDP packets to the affected system to trigger the vulnerability.
- **IKEv1 traffic:** The attacker must send traffic specifically targeted to the device's IKEv1 service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, unauthenticated access:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated to the affected device.
- **Network connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable device over the network and send crafted UDP packets to it.
- **Knowledge of IKEv1 fragmentation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft fragmented IKEv1 packets to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Target IKEv1:** The attacker must target devices that have IKEv1 enabled and configured for VPN services.

**Additional Information:**
- IKEv1 fragmentation is not enabled by default.
- The vulnerability affects devices configured for IKEv1-based VPNs, such as LAN-to-LAN VPN, Remote Access VPN (excluding SSLVPN), DMVPN, FlexVPN, and GETVPN.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- The advisory provides commands to verify if IKEv1 fragmentation is enabled and if the device is processing IKE packets.
- There are no workarounds available other than disabling IKEv1 fragmentation, which may not be feasible for all environments.
