=====[1. Overview
]============================================================

 * System affected  : Atlassian Confluence
 * Software Version : 5.9.12
                      Other versions or models may also be affected.
 * Impact           : This vulnerability allows an attacker to use
Confluence's
                      platform to deliver attacks against other users.

=====[2. Detailed description
]================================================

Atlassian Confluence version 5.9.12 is vulnerable to persistent cross-site
scripting (XSS) because it fails to securely validate user controlled data,
thus making it possible for an attacker to supply crafted input in order to
harm users. The bug occurs at pages carrying attached files, even though
the
attached file name parameter is correctly sanitized upon submission, it is
possible for an attacker to later edit the attached file name property and
supply crafted data (i.e HTML tags and script code) without the
occurrence of
any security checks, resulting in an exploitable persistent XSS.

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, go to a page with an attached
file,
click on "Attachments" in order to list the page's attachments, and then
click
on "Properties" for the file of your choice. Edit the file name to, for
example, <script>alert(1)</script>test.pdf and then save the changes.
Albeit
the XSS is not executed within the page display, it is possible to
trigger the
execution of the supplied code while performing a search within
Confluence in
which results include the attachment with crafted file name. For that
matter,
the search terms " or * will promptly display the file and execute the
injected
javascript code.

As a means to further enlighten this, the following excerpt demonstrates
a POST
request with the malicious insertion within the newFileName field:

POST
/pages/doeditattachment.action?pageId={pageId}&attachmentBean.fileName={filename
} HTTP/1.1
Host: {confluence host}
Cookie: mywork.tab.tasks=false; JSESSIONID={redacted};
confluence.browse.space.cookie=space-templates
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: {redacted}

atl_token={atl_token}&pageId={pageId}&isFromPageView=false&newFileName=<script>a
lert(1)</script>file&newComment=&newContentType=application%2Foctet-stream&newPa
rentPage=&confirm=Save

It is worth noting that the issue may affect users regardless of privilege
levels, since the malicious page/attachment can be browsed by any user
within
the Atlassian Confluence instance.

=====[3. Affected versions & Solutions
]=======================================

This test was performed against Atlassian Confluence version 5.9.12.

According to vendor's response, the vulnerability is addressed and the
fix is
part of the 5.10.6 release.

=====[4. Timeline of disclosure

Aug/04/2016 - Vendor released the fix for the vulnerability in version
5.10.6.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
