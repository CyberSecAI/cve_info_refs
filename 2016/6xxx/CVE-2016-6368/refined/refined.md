Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Cisco Firepower System Software's detection engine parsing of Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) protocol packets. Specifically, a flaw in how the Snort process handles these packets leads to an unexpected restart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of PGM packets by the Snort process within the Cisco Firepower System Software.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to the Snort process crashing and restarting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is that the Snort process restarts, which can lead to:
  - Interruption of network traffic inspection.
  - Potential bypass of Snort detection.
  - Dropped traffic on routed, switched, and non-bypass interfaces and FirePOWER Threat Defense (FTD) platforms.
  - Bypassed traffic on passive and bypass interfaces and for ASA if the `sfr fail-open` command is configured.
- The specific impact can depend on the platform and configuration of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to authenticate.
- **Network-based Attack:**  The attacker sends specially crafted PGM protocol packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send PGM packets to the vulnerable device. No authentication or special privileges are required, making this remotely exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability also affects the open-source Snort project.
- The issue is related to the parsing of PGM packets, which triggers the Snort process restart.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability besides upgrading to the fixed software.

This analysis provides more detail than the basic CVE description, particularly on the specific impact based on the interface configuration and the conditions under which traffic might be dropped or bypassed.
