Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-6891:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper parsing of the ASN.1 Bit Field within X.509 certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs because the MatrixSSL library doesn't properly handle the ASN.1 Bit Field when parsing X.509 certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). An out-of-bounds read can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted X.509 certificate to a server using MatrixSSL. This could occur, for instance, during client authentication where the server processes a certificate received from the client.
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted X.509 certificate to a vulnerable server. This could be achieved through network traffic sent to the server's SSL port, often port 443 for HTTPS.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability, along with CVE-2016-6890 (heap overflow) and CVE-2016-6892 (improper free), highlights flaws in the X.509 certificate handling within MatrixSSL versions 3.8.5 and earlier.
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by devices processing untrusted X.509 certificates.
-  The fix for this vulnerability is included in MatrixSSL version 3.8.6.
