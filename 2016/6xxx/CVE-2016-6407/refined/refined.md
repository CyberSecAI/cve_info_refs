Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) handles HTTP request forwarding. Specifically, there's a flaw that allows an attacker to cause link saturation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core issue is that an attacker can exploit the HTTP request forwarding mechanism to saturate the network links, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is categorized as CWE-399 (Resource Management Errors).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Availability Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service. The appliance becomes unresponsive due to the saturated network links, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely without requiring any authentication. This means an attacker can initiate the attack from anywhere on the network without needing to log in or gain any privileges on the target system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system, indicating it is remotely exploitable over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the Cisco WSA.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication.
*   The attacker can be an external, unauthenticated user.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **Base Score:** 5.0
    *   **AV:N** (Network): The attack can be performed over the network.
    *   **AC:L** (Low): The attack does not require special conditions.
    *   **Au:N** (None): No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **C:N** (None): There is no impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:N** (None): There is no impact on integrity.
    *   **A:P** (Partial): The attack can partially disrupt availability.

*   **Temporal Score:** 4.8
    *   **E:F** (Functional): Functional exploit code is available.
    *  **RL:U** (Unavailable): No official solution or fix is available
    *   **RC:C** (Confirmed): The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability, which makes patching essential.
*   Cisco is not aware of public exploits or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time the advisory was released.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the Cisco Web Security Appliance.

In summary, CVE-2016-6407 is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in Cisco WSA that allows an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by saturating network links via HTTP request forwarding.
