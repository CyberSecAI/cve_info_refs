Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6804:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Apache OpenOffice installer for Windows has a flaw in its search path logic when loading dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking/Search Order Hijacking:** The installer doesn't properly validate the location of DLLs it loads. It is susceptible to loading a malicious DLL from the same directory as the installer if it exists and has the same name as a legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution with Elevated Privileges:** A malicious actor can place a specially crafted DLL in the same directory as the OpenOffice installer. When the installer executes, it loads this malicious DLL under its administrative privileges, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code with the same elevated permissions.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control of the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer. The user then needs to execute the installer.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attack requires placing a malicious file on the user's file system in a specific location relative to the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to write files to the user's file system, specifically in the location where the OpenOffice installer will be executed.
*   The attacker must create a malicious DLL with the same name as one of the libraries the installer depends on.
* The attacker must trick the victim into running the installer from a folder containing the malicious DLL.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older, as well as older OpenOffice.org versions.
*   There were no known exploits of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory, although a proof-of-concept demonstration existed.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.3.
*   Workarounds are suggested, such as running the installer from an empty folder or deleting extraction folders after installation. These are considered good security practices for any installer on Windows.
