Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6434:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded, weak password ("admin") for the root account of the local MySQL database within the Cisco Firepower Threat Management Console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a static, easily guessable password for the MySQL root user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker, with access to the MySQL instance, can bypass authentication and gain full control over the database. This provides access to potentially sensitive data, including the Sourcefire database.
- Though the MySQL daemon is listening on localhost, this could be combined with other vulnerabilities to get remote access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The MySQL daemon only listens on the loopback address. So, an attacker must have local access to the system to directly exploit this vulnerability.
- **Chained Exploitation:** An attacker could use another vulnerability to gain a shell on the appliance, and then use the hardcoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device or another vulnerability to get shell access on the machine to exploit the weak credentials.
- **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the hardcoded password "admin" to access the MySQL database as root.
