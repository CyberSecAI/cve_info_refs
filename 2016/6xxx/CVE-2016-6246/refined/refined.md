Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6246:

**CVE-2016-6246**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `tmpfs` filesystem allows the mounting user to specify a username, a group name, or a device name for the root node of the filesystem. If a user specifies a value of `VNOVAL` for any of these fields, it will trigger an assertion failure in the `tmpfs_alloc_node` function.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An assertion failure due to the use of `VNOVAL` leads to a kernel panic. This is a logic error in the tmpfs filesystem code, where the code does not properly handle `VNOVAL` values in the node creation process.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a kernel panic, which leads to a denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `mount` system call. A user with the ability to mount a `tmpfs` filesystem can trigger the panic. This can be any user on systems where `kern.usermount` is set to true or the root user.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be either the root user or a user on a system with `kern.usermount` set to true. They need to be able to execute the `mount` system call and control the mount options for a `tmpfs` filesystem, specifically setting the username, groupname or device name to `VNOVAL`.

**Summary of vulnerability information:**

The vulnerability lies in the way `tmpfs` handles user-specified parameters during mount operations. Specifically, providing the `VNOVAL` value for username, groupname, or device name fields triggers an assertion leading to a kernel panic. This is a denial-of-service vulnerability that can be exploited by local users with sufficient privileges to mount filesystems.
