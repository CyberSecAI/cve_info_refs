Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the creation of the `/etc/qci/answers` file with world-readable permissions. This file contains the root password for the deployed system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure File Permissions: The primary vulnerability is the creation of a file containing sensitive information (root password) with overly permissive read access (world-readable).
- Exposure of Sensitive Data:  The root password being stored in plain text within this file makes it easily accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: An attacker gaining access to the `/etc/qci/answers` file can obtain the root password.
- Complete System Compromise: With the root password, an attacker can gain complete control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: An attacker with local access to the system where QCI is deployed could directly read the file.
- Privilege Escalation: If a less privileged user gains access, they could use the root password to escalate their privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires some form of access to the system where QCI is installed. This could be direct local access, or access through compromised user account.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in QCI 1.0 GA.
- The report comes from Thom Carlin of Red Hat.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms that the issue was a security vulnerability that resulted in the creation of world readable file containing a sensitive password.
