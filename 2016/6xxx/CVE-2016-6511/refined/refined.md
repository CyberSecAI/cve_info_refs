Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6511:

**CVE Description:**
The provided documents indicate that CVE-2016-6511 is related to a vulnerability in the Wireshark OpenFlow dissector that could lead to a denial of service due to a long loop.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the OpenFlow dissector that can cause it to enter a long loop when processing a malformed packet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an infinite loop issue in the OpenFlow dissector. This is triggered by malformed packets causing the dissector to loop, resulting in high CPU resource consumption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS). An attacker can force Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, making the application unresponsive and potentially causing it to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the injection of a malformed OpenFlow packet. This packet can either be sent over the network (if the attacker is in a position to do so) or by convincing a user to open a malformed capture file (.pcap file).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to inject malformed OpenFlow packets into a network being monitored by Wireshark, or to convince a user to open a crafted capture file containing the malformed packets. The attacker does not need specific privileges or access to the target machine.

**Additional details:**
The provided documents include references to specific Wireshark versions affected by this vulnerability, as well as references to the bug report and security advisory. The vulnerability has been assigned the internal id "wnpa-sec-2016-47".
