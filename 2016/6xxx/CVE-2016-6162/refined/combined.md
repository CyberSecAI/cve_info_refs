| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1353538#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-07 12:08:20 UTC  ``` The code in the net/core/skbuff.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service (a system panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via certain IPv6 socket operations.  Reference (contains reproducer):  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/8>  An upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a612769774a3>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1353538#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-07 12:09:00 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1353539](show_bug.cgi?id=1353539 "CLOSED INSUFFICIENT_DATA - CVE-2016-6162 kernel: Kernel panic triggered at BUG_ON in net/core/skbuff.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1353538#c4)  Justin M. Forbes    2017-06-21 18:08:27 UTC  ``` This fix has been in Fedora for a long time now.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1353538#c7)  Vladis Dronov    2019-04-18 22:29:57 UTC  ``` Note:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is not vulnerable to this flaw as only a part of offending commit e6afc8ace6dd without the bug was backported. Other Red Hat products are not affected also, as either the bug is fully fixed or offending code is not present.   ``` |  |
