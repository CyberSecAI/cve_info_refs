Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a bug in the Linux kernel's `net/core/skbuff.c` file, specifically at line 3051. The root cause is related to certain IPv6 socket operations, which lead to a BUG_ON condition, resulting in a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A `BUG_ON` statement in the skbuff.c file is triggered under specific conditions, leading to a kernel panic.
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling during certain IPv6 socket operations.
- The specific code path involves `udpv6_queue_rcv_skb`, `__udp6_lib_rcv`, `udpv6_rcv`, `ip6_input_finish`, `ip6_input`, and `__netif_receive_skb` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to a kernel panic.
-  There is a possibility of "unspecified other impact" beyond the DoS, although this is not clearly defined.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through local users performing specific IPv6 socket operations.
- A reproducer program `derp2.c` is mentioned, indicating that the vulnerability can be reliably triggered. The reproducer makes use of system calls such as `SYS_mmap`, `SYS_socket`, `SYS_bind`, `SYS_sendto`, `SYS_setsockopt`, `SYS_dup`, and `SYS_write` to trigger the bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute programs on the system.
- The attacker needs to craft specific IPv6 socket operations to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Linux kernel versions up to 4.7-rc6.
- The fix was implemented in upstream kernel with commit `a612769774a3`.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is not vulnerable because it only backported the fix without the bug. Other Red Hat products are not affected.

In summary, CVE-2016-6162 is a local denial-of-service vulnerability in the Linux kernel triggered by specific IPv6 socket operations, resulting in a kernel panic due to a `BUG_ON` statement being reached.
