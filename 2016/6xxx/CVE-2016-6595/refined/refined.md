Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6595:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper resource management in Docker Swarmkit when handling repeated join and leave operations by a node. The manager node accumulates state from old nodes without removing it, eventually exhausting its memory and becoming unable to accept new nodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability of a node to exhaust the resources (specifically memory) of the Swarm manager by repeatedly joining and leaving the cluster.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The system lacks rate limiting or other protective measures to prevent a single node from performing excessive join/leave operations.
*   **Improper Resource Cleanup:** The manager does not properly clean up the state associated with nodes that have left the swarm, leading to memory exhaustion.
*   **Trust Boundary Violation:** A worker node, which is not supposed to administer the swarm, can effectively disable or shut down the swarm by exhausting the manager's resources

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition on the Docker Swarm. The manager becomes unable to accept new nodes, effectively preventing legitimate nodes from joining the swarm.
*   **Cluster Unavailability:** The swarm becomes unavailable for adding new nodes and potentially affected other operations that rely on the manager's resources.
*  **Dispatcher stopped:** The Docker debugging info suggests that the Dispatcher is stopped and CA server might exit sometimes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Node:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by controlling a node within the swarm.
*   **Repeated Join/Leave Operations:** The attacker repeatedly joins and quits the swarm using their controlled node.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Join Token:** The attacker needs a valid token to join the swarm as a node. This is a requirement for joining the swarm and not a weakness itself, but it enables the attack.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the Swarm manager to initiate the join/leave operations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The reporter of the issue performed at least 1000 join and leave operations to trigger the issue.
*   The Docker team argues that this is not a true vulnerability but a resource provisioning issue since joining nodes requires a token. However, the security community considers it a trust boundary violation, where a worker node can impact the system.
*   There are discussions around rate-limiting and other protective measures to prevent this issue.
