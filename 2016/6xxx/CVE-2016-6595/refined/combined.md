Subject: Re: cve request: docker swarmkit Dos occurs by repeatly joining and
 quitting swam cluster as a node

A few weeks ago (Aug 4, 2016), a CVE (CVE-2016-6595) describing a DoS on
docker swarm got issued. We believe this not a real issue, and would like
to have the CVE rescinded.

The person reporting this "vulnerability" is exhausting the resources of a
remote manager by doing hundreds of join/leave operations without removing
the state that is left by old nodes. At some point the manager obviously
stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory.

Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are
*required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of
operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust
manager resources.

We can't do anything about a manager running out of memory and not being
able to add new legitimate nodes to the system. This is merely a resource
provisioning issue, and definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability.

Thank you,

DoS is often a gray area. Obviously if I send 10 gigabits of request
traffic and swarm gets slow/non responsive the CVE response would be "Well
yeah... that's probably what happens if you saturate the network with
requests. No CVE for you" but if a single node behaves in an odd way and
prevents the whole system from working in an expected manner, that may be a
problem that is worth a CVE, especially if it can be triggered by an
attacker/less trusted user (classic trust boundary violation to quote
@sushidude).

Regardless of whether this is CVE worthy is there any plan to add rate
limiting or other protective measures to prevent a single badly
behaved/malicious node from making the swarm unable to operate normally? I
don't see any issues in <https://github.com/docker/swarm/issues> for this.
Thanks!
