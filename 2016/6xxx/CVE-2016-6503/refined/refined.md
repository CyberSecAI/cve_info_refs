Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6503

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the CORBA IDL dissector of Wireshark, specifically triggered by a malformed packet. This suggests a parsing or processing error within the dissector when handling unusual or unexpected data structures in the CORBA IDL format. The issue seems to be specific to 64-bit Windows environments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed CORBA IDL packets.
- Potential memory corruption or access violation due to the parsing error on 64 bit Windows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash. This prevents users from analyzing network traffic, disrupting network monitoring and troubleshooting activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Injection: An attacker can inject a crafted, malformed CORBA IDL packet into the network traffic being captured by Wireshark.
- Malicious Capture File: An attacker can provide a user with a specially crafted packet capture file that contains the malicious CORBA IDL packet. Upon loading the file in Wireshark, the application will crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to inject network traffic into a network segment being captured by a Wireshark instance.
- Ability to deliver a malicious packet capture file to a Wireshark user.
- No specific user interaction beyond opening the malformed file

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.4 are vulnerable.
- Specifically, the issue is present on 64-bit Windows.

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark version 2.0.5 and later.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is identified as `wnpa-sec-2016-39` in Wireshark's security advisories.
- The exploit requires a specially crafted GIOP (General Inter-ORB Protocol) packet
