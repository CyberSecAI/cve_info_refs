Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6872:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `StringUtil::implode` function in Facebook's HHVM. This function is responsible for joining array elements into a string with a specified delimiter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code calculating the total length of the resulting string did not properly account for potential integer overflows. Specifically, the `len` variable, which accumulates the lengths of the strings and delimiters, could exceed the maximum value for its data type, leading to an incorrect length calculation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **String Length Exceeded Error:** When the integer overflow occurs, the calculated length becomes a small value or even a negative number which results in an attempt to create a string with an invalid length causing a fatal error, effectively crashing the application or preventing it from continuing normally. This can be seen in the added test case output which shows the "String length exceeded 2^31-2" fatal error being thrown.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted input to the `implode` function, specifically an array with strings and delimiters that would cause the calculated string length to overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `implode` function such as an array with specific elements which when combined would result in a string size larger than the maximum allowed.  This could be through a web application taking user input, or otherwise.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided github commit includes a test case to demonstrate the integer overflow, and a fix which changes the integer type of the length variable from `int` to `size_t` which is a larger data type, effectively resolving the vulnerability.
