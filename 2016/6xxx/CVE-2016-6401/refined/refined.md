RELATED: CVE-2016-6401

Root cause of vulnerability:
A vulnerability in IPv6 over MPLS packet processing of Cisco IOS XR for Cisco Carrier Routing System (CRS) platforms.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Improper handling of IPv6 over MPLS packets. Specifically, the affected router must strip the MPLS label and parse a crafted IPv6 packet. IPv6 packets received without an MPLS label do not trigger the vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can cause a reload of the affected line card, resulting in a denial of service. On line cards based on CRS-1 or CRS-3, the processing of the packets will result in a crash. On cards based on CRS-X, packet processing will result in a packet processing engine (PPE) dump.

Attack vectors:
Sending a crafted IPv6 packet over MPLS to a vulnerable Cisco CRS router.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker must be adjacent to the affected network. The attacker must be able to send IPv6 packets over MPLS to the affected Cisco CRS router.
