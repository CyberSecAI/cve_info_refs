- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Reflected XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited by crafting malicious URLs containing the malicious script, which are then sent to or accessed by the victim user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need the ability to craft malicious URLs and entice victims to access them. The attacker is not required to have any access to the server or application directly.
