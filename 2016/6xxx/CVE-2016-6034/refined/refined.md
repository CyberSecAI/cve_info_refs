- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware vSphere GUI, where Windows domain credentials can be disclosed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Password disclosure. The system exposes Windows domain credentials to a user with a high level of privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges can potentially gain access to Windows domain credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems/resources within the domain.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the VMware vSphere GUI, likely due to insufficient protection of stored credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a high level of privileges within the system.
