Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-6540:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of authentication on the TrackR Bravo's cloud-based service API. This allows unauthenticated access to query and send GPS data for any TrackR device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication requirements for accessing the cloud service API, specifically the endpoints related to GPS data.
*   **Information Exposure:** The TrackR device ID, needed to query the API, is easily discoverable via Bluetooth, as it's derived from the device's BLE MAC address (CVE-2016-6539), exacerbating the impact of the missing authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Location Tracking:** An attacker can remotely track a user's location by querying the API for GPS data associated with their TrackR device.
*   **Data Modification:** Although not the primary impact, an attacker can potentially send manipulated GPS data, although the primary concern is location tracking.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Internet:** The attack vector is primarily through the internet to access the cloud-based service.
*   **Bluetooth (Indirect):** The device ID is obtained through Bluetooth, making it a prerequisite step for the internet-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of TrackR Device ID:** The attacker needs to obtain the TrackR device ID through Bluetooth scanning within proximity to the target's device.
*   **Internet Access:** The attacker requires internet access to interact with the cloud API, no special permissions or credentials on the cloud service are required.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to query or send GPS data without needing any authentication.
*   The URL format to access the GPS data is mentioned, `https://phonehalocloud.appspot.com/rest/tracker/00000f7c-XXXXXXd9`.
*   The TrackR device ID is constructed as the four zeroes (0000), followed by the device's BLE MAC address in reverse.
*   The issue was fixed server-side and the deprecated call was removed by the vendor and that the cloud service no longer allows unauthenticated access to gps data.
*  Updated apps, version 5.1.6 for iOS and 2.2.5 for Android, have been released by the vendor to address these vulnerabilities.
