Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6713:

**CVE-2016-6713**

*   **Root Cause:** A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the `libavc` library. Specifically, it involves how the library handles errors when processing multi-slice MB Aff streams.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of errors within the multi-slice MB Aff stream processing in the `libavc` library. This can lead to a crash if the context buffers are not handled correctly.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious media file that triggers the error condition within the `libavc` library. Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service, causing the device to hang or reboot.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted media file that contains a malformed multi-slice MB Aff stream. This could be delivered via various means such as email, web browsing, or MMS.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted media file to the device.
    *   The attacker does not need to have a privileged position on the device to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix addresses the issue by:
    *   Initializing a default reference buffer for erroneous interlaced clips.
    *   Picking the slice type from the decode thread's slice structure.
    *   Calling `start_of_pic` only once.
