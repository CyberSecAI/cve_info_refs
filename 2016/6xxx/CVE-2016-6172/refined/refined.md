{
  "CVE-2016-6172": {
    "Description": "A malicious primary DNS server can crash a secondary PowerDNS server due to improper restriction of zone size limits. This update adds a feature to limit AXFR sizes in response to this flaw.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper restriction of zone size limits during zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Lack of input validation or size limits on incoming zone transfer data."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious primary DNS server can cause a denial of service on a secondary PowerDNS server by sending an excessively large zone transfer, leading to memory exhaustion and server crash. This impacts the service of other zones hosted on the same server.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "A malicious primary DNS server initiating a zone transfer (AXFR or IXFR) to a vulnerable secondary server."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or have compromised a primary DNS server that is configured to perform zone transfers to the vulnerable PowerDNS secondary server."
  }
