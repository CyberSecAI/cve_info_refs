Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a weakness in how phpMyAdmin handles cookie encryption. Specifically, the decryption process of usernames/passwords stored in cookies is vulnerable to a padding oracle attack. Additionally, the same initialization vector (IV) is used to hash the username and password, which can reveal if the username and password are the same.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Padding Oracle Attack:**  The decryption of username/password stored in a cookie is susceptible to a padding oracle attack. This allows an attacker with access to the cookie to decrypt the username and password.
2. **Initialization Vector (IV) Reuse:** The same IV is used to hash the username and password in the cookie. This weakness, while not allowing direct decoding of the values, exposes the fact when a user has set the same value for both username and password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to a user's browser cookie file can decrypt the stored username and password due to the padding oracle vulnerability. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user and gain access to the phpMyAdmin application.
- If username and password are the same, the attacker, by examining the cookie, can infer that these values are identical.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to a user's browser cookie file. This could be achieved through various means, such as malware, social engineering, or compromising the user's system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to obtain the browser cookie file of a phpMyAdmin user.
- The attacker needs to be able to leverage the padding oracle to decrypt the cookie.

**Additional Notes:**
- The phpMyAdmin security advisory PMASA-2016-29 specifically addresses this vulnerability, rating it as "critical."
- The provided Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201701-32) lists CVE-2016-6606 as one of the multiple vulnerabilities that affect phpMyAdmin.
- The Debian security advisory (DLA 1821-1) also lists CVE-2016-6606 as a vulnerability fixed in their phpmyadmin package.
