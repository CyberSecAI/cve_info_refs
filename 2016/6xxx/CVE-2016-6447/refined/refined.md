Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6447

**Root Cause:** A buffer underflow vulnerability exists within Cisco Meeting Server and Meeting App.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-119:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. This indicates a memory corruption issue where the software doesn't properly validate buffer boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit.
*   No authentication is required (Au:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable Cisco Meeting Server or Meeting App.
*   No prior authentication is required for the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects:
    *   Cisco Meeting Server releases prior to 2.0.1
    *   Acano Server releases prior to 1.8.16 and prior to 1.9.3
    *   Cisco Meeting App releases prior to 1.9.8
    *   Acano Meeting Apps releases prior to 1.8.35
*   Exploitability is considered "Functional" (E:F), meaning that functional exploit code is available and works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.
*   A vendor solution (official fix) is available (RL:OF)
*   The vulnerability is confirmed (RC:C) by the vendor.
*   The base CVSS score is 7.5, and the temporal score is 6.2. The CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
