Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a side-channel issue in the RSA implementation within MatrixSSL. Specifically, a Bleichenbacher variant attack allows an attacker to extract information by observing the timing or behavior of RSA private key operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Side-channel leakage:** The RSA implementation leaks information about the premaster secret through observable behaviors of the RSA private key operation.
- **Bleichenbacher variant attack:** This refers to a specific type of attack that exploits the way RSA decryption is performed to gain information about the encrypted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially recover the premaster secret, compromising the confidentiality of the communication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a network-based attack where an attacker sends specifically crafted messages, designed to trigger the vulnerability in the RSA private key operation of the MatrixSSL library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to communicate with the vulnerable system.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Messages:** The attacker must be able to send messages designed to trigger the vulnerable RSA private key operation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix implemented in MatrixSSL involved modifying the code to ensure that no information is leaked during the RSA operation, effectively preventing the Bleichenbacher variant attack. The code now errors without providing information on the premaster contents.
