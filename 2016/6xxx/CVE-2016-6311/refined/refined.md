{
  "CVE-2016-6311": {
    "description": "Internal IP address disclosed on redirect when request header Host field is not set.",
    "root_cause": "The server, when processing a request that results in a 302 redirect, includes the internal IP address of the server in the 'Location' response header when the 'Host' header field is not set in the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Improper handling of missing Host header"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can learn the internal IP address of the server, which can be used for reconnaissance and potentially for further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a GET request to the server that results in a 302 redirect, without setting the Host header field."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and receive responses.",
     "additional_information": "The issue occurs in the `HttpServerExchange` class where the `getHostAndPort()` method always returns the local `InetAddress` if the `Host` header field was not set. This can be mitigated by setting a filter that adds a default hostname if the host header is not present."
