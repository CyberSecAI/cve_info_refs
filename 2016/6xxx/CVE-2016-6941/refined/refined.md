- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability that could lead to code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The document doesn't explicitly mention the attack vector, but given the context of Adobe Acrobat and Reader, the vulnerability is likely triggered by processing a maliciously crafted PDF file.
