Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insufficient use of random values in RESTEasy asynchronous jobs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Randomness:** The core issue is the lack of adequate randomness when generating values used in asynchronous job processing within RESTEasy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality Loss:** An attacker could exploit this flaw to potentially steal sensitive user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable through the RESTEasy asynchronous job service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to interact with or influence the RESTEasy async job service to take advantage of the insufficient random values. This likely requires the attacker to be able to initiate or interfere with asynchronous jobs.

**Additional Notes:**
* The bug report mentions a mitigation of disabling the Async Jobs Service, which implies that this service is the area where the weakness exists.
* The vulnerability is fixed in resteasy versions 3.1.0.CR1 and 3.0.20.Final
