  "CVE-2016-6335": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "multiple",
      "Curation": "unreviewed",
      "Relevancy": "relevant"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The MediaWiki API call using JSONP reveals private user data including username and CSRF token.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Information Leak",
        "CSRF bypass"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker may take advantage of the revealed information to circumvent CSRF protection. The returned data included the mw.user.tokens.set call with the CSRF token, allowing for bypassing CSRF protection in almost all forms across the wiki.",
       "Attack vector": "By making a crafted API request with `action=parse&prop=headhtml&format=json&callback=foo`, an attacker can leak sensitive user information if the victim is logged in.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to induce a logged in user to visit a page that makes the crafted API request. The attacker needs to be able to make a JSONP request to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance."
