Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6136:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a double-fetch issue within the `audit_log_single_execve_arg()` function in the Linux kernel's auditing subsystem.
*   The function fetches user-space arguments for `execve()` calls multiple times, leading to a race condition where the data fetched can change between checks and logging. Specifically:
    *   First fetch: to verify if any "bad" characters exist which would require hex encoding.
    *   Second fetch: to be logged in the audit record, with subsequent processing based on the previous (potentially stale) verification.
    *   There is a third fetch due to the `strnlen_user()` call at the beginning of the function, though this is not relied upon after the patch.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race condition:** Multiple fetches of the same data without proper locking mechanisms create a race condition. This enables an attacker to potentially manipulate data between fetches.
*  **Double-fetch**: The vulnerability leads to a double fetch of the argument data, which is a type of Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Corruption:** If the user-space data changes between fetches, the audit subsystem may log corrupt records.
*   **Evasion of Logging:** An attacker could manipulate the arguments of `execve()` calls to evade the intended audit logging mechanisms and misrepresent the commands that were executed. The issue could lead to the corruption of logs.
*  A corrupt audit record may be created in the kernel log. The corruption in logging of execve arguments could allow an attacker to either misrepresent or evade the recording of which commands were executed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local attack:** A local attacker needs to run an application that would trigger the vulnerable code path in the audit subsystem. This requires the attacker to be able to execute code on the machine
*   An application with the ability to change the user space data, for example through a multi threaded application in the same process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to execute code in the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to change the execve arguments from user-space while they are being audited.

**Additional details from analysis (not in the CVE):**
* The patch removes the double fetch of the argument, by fetching the argument data only once and storing it in a buffer.
* The patch also enhances handling of large arguments, performs stricter record length checks, and some minor performance enhancements (removing strlen calls).
* The patch also addresses a triple fetch, by calling strnlen_user(), which is called before the argument is fetched, although this is used for recording purposes.
* The vulnerability affects the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, MRG-2 and realtime and will be addressed in future updates. This issue was also resolved in the 4.8.8 stable release and was released as an update to all supported Fedora versions.
* The issue is present in the `kernel/auditsc.c` file.
