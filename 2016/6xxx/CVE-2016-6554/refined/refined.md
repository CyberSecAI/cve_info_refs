Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6554:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of **insecure default credentials** on Synology NAS servers. Specifically, the affected devices had default usernames and passwords (guest:(blank) and admin:(blank)) that were not randomized, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-255: Credentials Management:** The core weakness is the lack of secure credential management, specifically the use of default, easily guessable credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can gain **complete control** of a vulnerable device using the default admin credentials. This allows them to access and manipulate data, change configurations, and potentially use the device for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote network attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who can reach the vulnerable device over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Synology NAS server.
*   No special authentication or privileges beyond network access are required because default credentials are used.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Synology NAS servers DS107 (firmware version 3.1-1639 and prior), DS116, and DS213 (firmware versions prior to 5.2-5644-1)
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ory Segal and Ezra Caltum.
