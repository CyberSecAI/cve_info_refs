  "CVE-2016-6263": {
    "description": "The stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize function in lib/nfkc.c in libidn before 1.33 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) via crafted UTF-8 data.",
    "root_cause": "The `stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize` function in libidn did not properly handle invalid UTF-8 input, leading to an out-of-bounds read and a crash.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing crafted UTF-8 data, potentially leading to application crashes.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by providing crafted UTF-8 data to the vulnerable function. The specific attack vector is context-dependent.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted UTF-8 data as input to the `stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize` function."
