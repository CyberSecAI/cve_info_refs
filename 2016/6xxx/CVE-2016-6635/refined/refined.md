Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6635:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3681-1 explicitly lists CVE-2016-6635 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the wordpress security update. This confirms that the provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a missing CSRF protection in the script compression option of WordPress.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The vulnerability is present due to the lack of a nonce check for the AJAX action that updates the script compression setting.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to change the script compression settings of a WordPress site on behalf of a logged-in administrator. This could potentially lead to denial of service by changing settings to prevent scripts from loading.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTML page or email containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, would trigger the vulnerable AJAX action.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit a malicious page under the attacker's control.

**3. Technical Details (From Github Commit):**

The GitHub commit 9b7a7754133c50b82bd9d976fb5b24094f658aab provides the fix for this vulnerability:

*   **`wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php`:**  A `check_ajax_referer` call is added to ensure the request is valid and not a CSRF attempt.
*   **`wp-admin/includes/template.php`:**  The `compression_test()` javascript function is updated to include the nonce.
*   **`wp-includes/version.php`:**  Version is updated.

The patch introduces a nonce in the AJAX request and verifies it server-side. This prevents unauthorized modification of the script compression setting.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-6635 is a CSRF vulnerability in WordPress related to the script compression setting. This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially cause denial of service by changing compression settings through a crafted request. The fix implemented adds proper nonce verification to the affected AJAX actions.
