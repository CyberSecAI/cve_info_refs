- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the option provided by Huawei servers' iBMC, allowing users to select SSL encryption algorithms. Choosing an insecure encryption algorithm exposes encrypted data to potential decryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main vulnerability is the use of a weak encryption algorithm that allows decryption of sensitive data if selected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in the decryption of encrypted data, leading to information leaks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs access to the network of the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable server and be able to intercept encrypted communications. They also must have knowledge that the server is using an insecure encryption algorithm.
