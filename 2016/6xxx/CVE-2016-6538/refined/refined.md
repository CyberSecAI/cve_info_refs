Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-6538:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TrackR Bravo mobile application stores the user's account password in cleartext within the `cache.db` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive authentication data (the user's password) in an unencrypted format. This violates basic security principles for handling credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker who gains access to the device or the `cache.db` file can obtain the user's password.
*   **Account Compromise:** With the password, an attacker can potentially access the user's TrackR account and its associated features, such as location data.
*   **Password Reuse Risk:** Users often reuse passwords across multiple services. If the exposed TrackR password is used elsewhere, those other accounts are also at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the device where the TrackR app is installed. This could be through physical theft or by accessing the file system of a compromised device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Device Access:** The attacker must have physical or remote access to the device where the TrackR mobile application is installed.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to browse the file system of the device to locate and read the `cache.db` file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the TrackR Bravo mobile application.
*   The identified vulnerability is tracked as `R7-2016-18.1`.
*   The vendor released updated apps (version 5.1.6 for iOS and 2.2.5 for Android) to address the issue.
*   Rapid7 researchers discovered the vulnerability.
