{
  "Root cause": "A cache-related side channel vulnerability was found in nettle's RSA and DSA decryption code.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Cache-timing side channel attack",
    "Improper mitigation of timing side-channel attacks"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker could recover the private key from a co-located virtual-machine instance.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Remote attacker",
    "Co-located virtual machine"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute code on a virtual machine co-located with the victim's virtual machine"
}
