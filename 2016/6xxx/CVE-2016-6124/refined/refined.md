- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Kenexa LMS on Cloud allows a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file upload can lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable web server.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can upload arbitrary files through a vulnerable web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a network connection to the vulnerable server and the ability to authenticate to the web interface (low-privileged access).
