Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Arista DCS-7050 series switches handle certain packets sent to the control plane. Specifically, a malformed or unexpected structure within these packets triggers a bug in the `strata-dma` component, leading to a kernel panic.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific, "unsupported sobmh version=0x5".
- This is tracked internally as BUG158250.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation of control plane packets on Arista DCS-7050 series switches.
- A kernel bug in the `strata-dma` component that doesn't handle the unexpected packet structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the vulnerability causes the affected switch to unexpectedly reboot. This results in a disruption of network services.
- This is a high impact issue as it disrupts network traffic flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is sending specially crafted packets to the control plane of the affected Arista DCS-7050 series switch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send packets to the control plane of the targeted switch. This could potentially be from an adjacent network or, depending on configuration, from a remote location.
- The attacker requires the ability to construct or modify packets to include the specific malformed data structures.
- No specific privileges are mentioned within the advisory.
