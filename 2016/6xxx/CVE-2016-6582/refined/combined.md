# [CVE-2016-6582] Doorkeeper gem does not revoke tokens & uses wrong auth/auth method

---

*From*: Justin Bull <me () justinbull ca>

*Date*: Thu, 18 Aug 2016 19:03:27 -0400

```
Good evening everyone,

A security bulletin for all of you.

Software:
--------
Doorkeeper (<https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper>)

Description:
----------
Doorkeeper is an OAuth 2 provider for Rails written in Ruby.

Affected Versions:
---------------
1.2.0 - 4.1.0 (all versions but latest patch supporting token revocation)

Fixed Versions:
-------------
4.2.0 or apply this commit[0]

Problem:
--------
Doorkeeper failed to implement OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation[1] (RFC
7009[2]) in the following ways:

1. Public clients making valid, unauthenticated calls to revoke a token
would not have their token revoked
2. Requests were not properly authenticating the *client credentials*
but were, instead, looking at the access token in a second location
3. Because of 2, the requests were also not authorizing confidential
clients' ability to revoke a given token. It should only revoke tokens
that belong to it.

(see [3][4][5][6] for above statements)

The security implication is: OAuth 2.0 clients who "log out" a user
expect to have the corresponding access & refresh tokens revoked,
preventing an attacker who may have already hijacked the session from
continuing to impersonate the victim. Because of the bug described
above, this is not the case. As far as OWASP is concerned, this counts
as broken authentication design[7].

MITRE has assigned CVE-2016-6582 due to the security issues raised. An
attacker, thanks to 1, can replay a hijacked session after a victim logs
out/revokes their token. Additionally, thanks to 2 & 3, an attacker via
a compromised confidential client could "grief" other clients by
revoking their tokens (albeit this is an exceptionally narrow attack
with little value).

Unless I'm mistaken, all clients (public or confidential) that send
well-formed, RFC 7009 compliant requests are affected by this bug.

Solution:
-------

Modify the controller so if the request comes from a public client
revoke the token without auth/auth. If the client is confidential,
authenticate the client per RFC 6749 Sec. 2.3[8] and authorize its
ownership of the provided token. As per [0].

Timeline:
--------
2016-08-03: Bug discovered
2016-08-03: CVE requested, assigned, privately disclosed to maintainer,
bugfix/patch authored
2016-08-08: Maintainer tweaked patch
2016-08-12: Jonathan Clem ( jclem) also discovered bug and publicly
disclosed[6]
2016-08-18: Patched version 4.2.0 is released

Acknowledgements:
-----------------
Special thanks to the maintainer, Tute Costa (<https://github.com/tute>),
for quickly collaborating with me to prepare & apply a patch.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Description

[![@jclem](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/412282?u=74824e46de84cc8634e556e4591bf2dbd0c6dcaa&v=4&size=48)](/jclem)[jclem](https://github.com/jclem)opened [on Aug 12, 2016](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/875#issue-170951345)

The [OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009#section-2.1) states that when revoking a token, "the client also includes its authentication credentials as described in [Section 2.3. of [RFC6749]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3)".

The spec's example request for revocation looks like this:

```
POST /revoke HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW

     token=45ghiukldjahdnhzdauz&token_type_hint=refresh_token

```

Note the HTTP Basic authentication, not Bearer. The spec goes on to say that the authorization server "first validates the client credentials (in case of a confidential client) and then verifies whether the token was issued to the client making the revocation request. If this validation fails, the request is refused and the client is informed of the error by the authorization server as described below".

It appears as though Doorkeeper instead [authorizes the request using HTTP Bearer with an access token](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/blob/c13ab298489945964db4f45ab3c37885223d28b8/spec/requests/flows/revoke_token_spec.rb#L17), even though [a code comment seems to imply otherwise](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/blob/c13ab298489945964db4f45ab3c37885223d28b8/app/controllers/doorkeeper/tokens_controller.rb#L14).
