  "guidelines_hit": true,
  "cve_id": "CVE-2016-6262",
  "analysis": {
    "relevant_content": true,
    "root_cause": "The `idn` command-line tool in GNU libidn performs an out-of-bounds read when processing a single zero byte as input.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive memory information. The out-of-bounds read might cause the `idn` tool to include arbitrary data from process memory in its output.",
    "attack_vector": "Network. An attacker could send an input with a single zero byte to the `idn` tool.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input (a zero byte) to the vulnerable program, which can be triggered over a network."
