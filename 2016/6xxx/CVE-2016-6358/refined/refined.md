Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the local FTP service of the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA). The FTP application can unexpectedly quit due to a flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a lack of proper input validation or error handling in the FTP service, leading to an unexpected process termination. Specifically the 'getpwnam()' function is being called with a non string argument, causing the program to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a partial denial of service (DoS) condition. The FTP process terminates, disrupting the intended functionality, but does not render the entire appliance unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. An attacker can send malicious input to the FTP service over the network, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco ESA. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `egg/fast_rpc.py` script.
- An error message that may be observed is: `An application fault occurred: ('egg/fast_rpc.py request|294', "", 'getpwnam() argument 1 must be string, not None`
