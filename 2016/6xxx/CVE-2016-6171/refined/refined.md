Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper restrictions on zone sizes in secondary DNS server implementations. This allows a malicious or compromised primary DNS server to send an extremely large zone transfer (AXFR) to a secondary server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Zone Transfer Size:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of limits on the size of zone data received during an AXFR transfer by secondary DNS servers. This lack of size validation can lead to resource exhaustion on the secondary server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious primary server can exploit this weakness to crash a secondary DNS server by sending a large zone transfer. This makes the secondary server unavailable.
- **Service Disruption:** Because a single secondary server may host multiple zones, a crash can disrupt services for all zones hosted on that server, not just the zone with the oversized transfer.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** In the case of NSD, the large transfer fills up the `/tmp` directory, leading to service failure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Primary DNS Server:** The attacker needs control or have compromised a primary DNS server that is authoritative for a zone that the vulnerable secondary server is configured to act as a slave.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the content of zone data served by a primary DNS server to cause the secondary server to crash.
- The attacker needs to know or have control of the IP address of an authoritative nameserver for the targeted zone and set up the malicious zone transfer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content mentions that BIND 9, Knot DNS, PowerDNS, and NSD are all affected. This is not directly part of the information for CVE-2016-6171, which only relates to Knot DNS, but it helps to understand the scope of the issue. Patches mentioned in the Github content suggest a mitigation to this issue which limits the incoming AXFR transfer size.
- The vulnerability allows a primary server to cause a denial-of-service on secondary servers by sending a large amount of zone data through the AXFR protocol.
