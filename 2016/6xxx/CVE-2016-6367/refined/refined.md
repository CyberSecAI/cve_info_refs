Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-6367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the command-line interface (CLI) parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software. Specifically, it's triggered by invoking certain invalid commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-119:** This indicates a memory corruption issue likely due to a buffer overflow or similar problem when parsing user-supplied input in the CLI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS condition by crashing the device.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code on the affected device. This would grant the attacker a high level of control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device, meaning they need to be physically present or have console access.
*   **Authenticated:** The attacker must be authenticated, implying they must have valid login credentials for the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be an authenticated, local user of the Cisco ASA device.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute commands via the CLI.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is referenced as "EPICBANANA" in the exploit disclosed by the Shadow Brokers group.
*   The exploit was made public by the Shadow Brokers group who claimed to have stolen it from the Equation Group.
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 6.8 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C) and temporal score is 5.9 (E:H/RL:OF/RC:C).
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA software versions earlier than 8.4(3).
*   Cisco PIX Firewalls and Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) are also affected, however, these products have reached end-of-life and will not receive a fix.
*  Snort rules 39983, 39984, 39985, 39986 and 39987 were released to detect exploitation attempts.
