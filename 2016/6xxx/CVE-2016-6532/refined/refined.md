- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DEXIS Imaging Suite 10 contains hard-coded database credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798) for database access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker may gain administrative access to the DEXIS patient database. This allows them to access and potentially modify sensitive patient information.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access, unauthenticated. An attacker does not need to have any prior access to the system to exploit the vulnerability, and can connect via the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable DEXIS server. No authentication or special access is required. The vulnerability is exploitable without prior user interaction.
