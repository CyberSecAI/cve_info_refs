2 min read

The decision to deliver the biannual (on the fourth Wednesday of every March and September) Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication brought with it many challenges, process changes, and—in the end—a format for Cisco Vulnerability Disclosure that we hope addresses at least some of your concerns. What we would like to get now is feedback from our customers on how the bundle delivery format has changed your lives (well, at least during working hours!), for better or for worse, when it comes to dealing with Cisco PSIRT security vulnerabilities identified in your Cisco IOS environment. The information you provide in this survey will help Cisco to continue to evolve our vulnerability disclosure process to address your challenges and concerns, just as we did back in 2008 when we listened to you and developed the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundle process.

# CVE-2016-6366

Public repository for improvements to the EXTRABACON exploit, a remote code execution for Cisco ASA written by the Equation Group (NSA) and leaked by the Shadow Brokers.

There is improved shellcode, a LINA offset finder script, a Metasploit module, and extrabacon-2.0.

We are adding patches for most versions of 8.x and 9.x in the near future after we test all versions on real hardware.

This is using improved shellcode, has less stages than the Equation Group version making it more reliable. This makes the SNMP payload packet ~150 less bytes. Also, the leaked version only supports 8.x, we have it working on 9.x versions.

### Supported Versions (so far)

Using the Lina offset finder script, it should be trivial to support all vulnerable x86 versions. We are working on doing just that. NOTE: x64 (9.6+?) introduces DEP and ASLR. The offset finder and generic payload will not work. It should still be possible to easily dos these versions though.

Open an issue if you would like us to support a specific version. It will move to the front of the line.

8.x

* 8.0(2)
* 8.0(3)
* 8.0(3)6
* 8.0(4)
* 8.0(4)32
* 8.0(5)
* 8.2(1)
* 8.2(2)
* 8.2(3)
* 8.2(4)
* 8.2(5)
* 8.2(5)33 `*`
* 8.2(5)41 `*`
* 8.2(5)55 `*`
* 8.3(1)
* 8.3(2)
* 8.3(2)39 `*`
* 8.3(2)40 `*`
* 8.3(2)-npe `*` `**`
* 8.4(1)
* 8.4(2)
* 8.4(3)
* 8.4(4)
* 8.4(4)1 `*`
* 8.4(4)3 `*`
* 8.4(4)5 `*`
* 8.4(4)9 `*`
* 8.4(6)5 `*`
* 8.4(7) `*`

9.x

* 9.0(1) `*`
* 9.1(1)4 `*`
* 9.2(1) `*`
* 9.2(2)8 `*`
* 9.2(3) `*`
* 9.2(4) `*`
* 9.2(4)13 `*`

`*` new version support not part of the original Shadow Brokers leak

`**` We currently can't distinguish between normal and NPE versions from the SNMP strings. We've commented out the NPE offsets, as NPE is very rare (it is for exporting to places where encryption is crappy), but in the future, we'd like to incorporate these versions. Perhaps as a bool option?

### Metasploit

`use auxiliary/admin/cisco/cisco_asa_extrabacon`

[rapid7/metasploit-framework#7359](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/7359)

Our initial pull request was merged into Metasploit master branch. We will still be contributing more offsets, which may be available here sooner depending on latency of future pull requests.

### Contributing

If you can test ASA versions, consider forking this project and generating payloads. We could mass-generate the payloads, but we want to test to make sure every payload exits cleanly.

You can add new payloads to the `extrabacon-2.0/improved/` folder after using `lina-offsets.py` to generate the file. Modules are named `shellcode_verstring.py`, where verstring is the version string returned by the ASA, with periods . replaced with underscores \_

Also submit pull requests stripping any unnecessary Python from the ExtraBacon 2.0 code.

### Lina offset finder

`python2 ./lina-offsets.py asa_lina_XXX.elf`

Will automatically generate necessary offsets to port the exploit to other versions of ASA.

Right now, it takes us longer to load a version of ASA firmware and test it, than it does to generate offsets for a specific version.

The only thing the script doesn't calculate is FIX\_EBP, which is usually 0x48 (72) or 0x58 (88). It seems like 8.4(1) and greater use 0x48.

You can extract Lina like this:

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:W/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 8.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 8.1 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 8.1 |

  The Unified Security Incident Response Plan (USIRP) is one of the primary means by which ICASI fulfills its mission of enhancing the global security landscape. Comprising a trusted forum and supporting processes, procedures, and tools, the USIRP enables Security Incident Response Teams (SIRTs) from ICASI member companies to collaborate quickly and effectively to resolve complex, multi-vendor Internet security issues. These issues include: vulnerabilities in commonly-used software; incidents - urgent or emergent - that affect three or more ICASI member organizations; and ongoing or long-term problems that warrant a strategic response.

  The USIRP works by harmonizing ICASI member companies' internal security incident response procedures and personnel by providing a common, formal framework with which these organizations can: trigger a USIRP event; share critical information about it; and work together effectively on a coordinated response.

  A process is presented that uses extensions to offload a hashing value for sensors to edge nodes. The hashing value can be included in an IPv6 Extension Header (in all packets, few packets, on-demand/request based). Any deviation in hashing is detected, and an instruction may be sent to a server using various extensions to trigger integrity/attestation validation. This provides an event-based integrity validation trigger from server to sensor. Until the integrity validation is completed, all the packets from the sensors may be dropped. Thus, a dataplane-based integrity validation process is provided that achieves faster abnormality detection and prevents the falsified data from affecting the service.

  National Security Agency and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency along with other international cybersecurity agencies have recently published an enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure guide.
  What stood out to me in this guide was two things.
  ✦ They have the Network Engineer and a Network Defender role separated out. However some of the tasks they have defined for Network Engineers is typically done by Network Defenders (Implementing SIEM) and others such as enforcing configuration management is typically done by Network Engineers. I didn't see the point of separating out the two roles as roles and job titles vary across orgs.
  ✦ They suggest closely monitoring configuration modifications or alterations and if feasible, test and override on a frequent basis. Most of the conversations in #autocon2 was about using automation for initial configuration, changes and keeping them synced across multiple devices through a common Source of Truth. I didn't think monitoring configurations and alerting on changes was a common practice. Considering many of the security breaches happen due to configuration errors, perhaps it makes sense.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Background

On August 13, 2016 a mysterious Twitter account ([@shadowbrokerss](https://twitter.com/shadowbrokerss)) appeared, tweeting a PasteBin link to numerous news organizations. The link described the process for an auction to unlock an encrypted file that claimed to contain hacking tools belonging to the Equation Group. Dubbed last year by Kaspersky Lab, Equation Group are sophisticated malware authors believed to be part of the Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO), a cyber-warfare intelligence-gathering unit of the National Security Agency (NSA). As a show of good faith, a second encrypted file and corresponding password were released, with tools containing numerous exploits and even zero-day vulnerabilities.

One of the zero-day vulnerabilities released was a remote code execution in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) device. The Equation Group's exploit for this was named EXTRABACON. Cisco ASAs are commonly used as the primary firewall for many organizations, so the EXTRABACON exploit release raised many eyebrows.

At [RiskSense](https://www.risksense.com/) we had spare ASAs lying around in our red team lab, and my colleague Zachary Harding was extremely interested in exploiting this vulnerability. I told him if he got the ASAs properly configured for remote debugging I would help in the exploitation process. Of course, the fact that there are virtually no exploit mitigations (i.e. ASLR, stack canaries, et al) on Cisco ASAs may have weighed in on my willingness to help. He configured two ASAs, one containing version 8.4(3) (which had EXTRABACON exploit code), and version 9.2(3) which we would target to write new code.

This blog post will explain the methodology for the following submissions to exploit-db.com:

* [Cisco ASA 9.2(3) - 'EXTRABACON' Authentication Bypass](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40386/)
* [Cisco ASA - Authentication Bypass 'EXTRABACON' (Improved Shellcode) (69 bytes)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40387/)

There is detailed information about how to support other versions of Cisco ASA for the exploit. Only a few versions of 8.x were in the exploit code, however the vulnerability affected all versions of ASA, including all of 8.x and 9.x. This post also contains information about how we were able to decrease the Equation Group shellcode from 2 stages containing over 200+ bytes to 1 stage of 69 bytes.

## Understanding the Exploit

Before we can begin porting the exploit to a new version, or improving the shellcode, we first need to know how the exploit works.

This remote exploit is your standard stack buffer overflow, caused by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the ASA. From the internal network, it's pretty much a guarantee with the default configuration. We were also able to confirm the attack can originate from the external network in some setups.

### Hijacking Execution

The first step in exploiting a 32-bit x86 buffer overflow is to control the EIP (instruction pointer) register. In x86, a function CALL pushes the current EIP location to the stack, and a RET pops that value and jumps to it. Since we overflow the stack, we can change the return address to any location we want.

In the shellcode\_asa843.py file, the first interesting thing to see is:

```

my_ret_addr_len = 4
my_ret_addr_byte = "\xc8\x26\xa0\x09"
my_ret_addr_snmp = "200.38.160.9"

```

This is an offset in 8.4(3) to 0x09a026c8. As this was a classic stack buffer overflow exploit, my gut told me this was where we would overwrite the RET address, and that there would be a JMP ESP (jump to stack pointer) here. Sometimes your gut is right:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2zZ1hSDUm9L_a0-Pb5WJDCS2rmI2ZruqqSa7Bd0YzEyI6xHzaSJsWUPOVOK4M4NFRN2PtQBY22AqSFUMOzBac1AVnKhHtb0q3Vv5A6k-MyQnLioybtwHB_GV9_FB65PoyrXu2EgDi1qM/s1600/9a026c8.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2zZ1hSDUm9L_a0-Pb5WJDCS2rmI2ZruqqSa7Bd0YzEyI6xHzaSJsWUPOVOK4M4NFRN2PtQBY22AqSFUMOzBac1AVnKhHtb0q3Vv5A6k-MyQnLioybtwHB_GV9_FB65PoyrXu2EgDi1qM/s1600/9a026c8.PNG)

The vulnerable file is called "lina". And it's an ELF file; who needs IDA when you can use objdump?

### Stage 1: "Finder"

The Equation Group shellcode is actually 3 stages. After we JMP ESP, we find our EIP in the "finder" shellcode.

```

finder_len = 9
finder_byte = "\x8b\x7c\x24\x14\x8b\x07\xff\xe0\x90"
finder_snmp = "139.124.36.20.139.7.255.224.144"

```

This code finds some pointer on the stack and jumps to it. The pointer contains the second stage.
[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq_t-J-DUXyMRBPW2Vf-Sx1Rc7jz2a2Rc4Gqiu8lZZiboDmD_oI3o9ruvgzmOosejcBDT1LXGUPfRXO8F0dsX_fXLiaUcBzAWyaIpnHn0mlDUKtSX6jmR9LvKRCaVb9oXMiq-QBFqrcXU/s1600/finder_shellcode.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq_t-J-DUXyMRBPW2Vf-Sx1Rc7jz2a2Rc4Gqiu8lZZiboDmD_oI3o9ruvgzmOosejcBDT1LXGUPfRXO8F0dsX_fXLiaUcBzAWyaIpnHn0mlDUKtSX6jmR9LvKRCaVb9oXMiq-QBFqrcXU/s1600/finder_shellcode.png)

We didn't do much investigating here as it was the same static offsets for every version. Our improved shellcode also uses this first stage.

### Stage 2: "Preamble"

Observing the main Python source code, we can see how the second stage is made:

```

        wrapper = sc.preamble_snmp
        if self.params.msg:
            wrapper += "." + sc.successmsg_snmp
        wrapper += "." + sc.launcher_snmp
        wrapper += "." + sc.postscript_snmp
```

Ignoring successmsg\_snmp (as the script --help text says DO NOT USE), the following shellcode is built:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEia38SLhZzzVAzNMLSq2gfiYpdOuaGGhKhpFA1y6zDnSIB7woRO3fOQ-VBrOghyphenhyphen42SdtxZ7_TirxYKKo0oGqmhebXe3eJJnOJqtdSk-Qbgs3UYXggv7rgG2UQy35FRtff8ZlnxujudHNQA/s1600/preamble.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEia38SLhZzzVAzNMLSq2gfiYpdOuaGGhKhpFA1y6zDnSIB7woRO3fOQ-VBrOghyphenhyphen42SdtxZ7_TirxYKKo0oGqmhebXe3eJJnOJqtdSk-Qbgs3UYXggv7rgG2UQy35FRtff8ZlnxujudHNQA/s1600/preamble.png)

It seems like a lot is going on here, but it's pretty simple.

1. A "safe" return address is XORed by 0xa5a5a5a5
   1. unnecessary, yet this type of XOR is everywhere. The shellcode can contain null bytes so we don't need a mask
2. Registers smashed by the stack overflow are fixed, including the frame base pointer (EBP)
3. The fixed registers are saved (PUSHA = push all)
4. A pointer to the third stage "payload" (to be discussed soon) is found on the stack
   * This offset gave us trouble. Luckily our improved shellcode doesn't need it!
5. Payload is called, and returns
6. The saved registers are restored (POPA = pop all)
7. The shellcode returns execution to the "safe" location, as if nothing happened

I'm guessing the safe return address is where the buffer overflow would have returned if not exploited, but we haven't actually investigated the root cause of the vulnerability, just how the exploit works. This is probably the most elusive offset we will need to find, and IDA does not recognize this part of the code section as part of a function.

If we follow the function that is called before our safe return, we can see why there are quite a few registers that need to be cleaned up.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6aunsJcJTDDDW5zIQUFKMfW_N7yo0ZF-WrJ_1pRuJQDb3lCVg_04F1uo_3IXWhWwlSz2ZtbzYSVh50LeHQVLN2LG1DOS1qHrHsYj2VZLYCHfGY1qKBnjIhXUHcBaS_36MoRTeycHxt1U/s1600/vuln_func.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6aunsJcJTDDDW5zIQUFKMfW_N7yo0ZF-WrJ_1pRuJQDb3lCVg_04F1uo_3IXWhWwlSz2ZtbzYSVh50LeHQVLN2LG1DOS1qHrHsYj2VZLYCHfGY1qKBnjIhXUHcBaS_36MoRTeycHxt1U/s1600/vuln_func.PNG)

These registers also get smashed by our overflow. If we don't fix the register values, the program will crash. Luckily the cleanup shellcode can be pretty static, with only the EBP register changing a little bit based on how much stack space is used.

### Stage 3: "Payload"

The third stage is where the magic finally happens. Normally shellcode, as it is aptly named, spawns a shell. But the Equation Group has another trick up its sleeve. Instead, we patch two functions, which we called "pmcheck()" and "admauth()", to always return true. With these two functions patched, we can log onto the ASA admin account without knowing the correct password.

Note: this is for payload "pass-disable". There's a second payload, "pass-enable", which re-patches the bytes. So after you log in as admin, you can run a second exploit to clean up your tracks.

For this stage, there is payload\_PMCHECK\_DISABLE\_byte and payload\_AAAADMINAUTH\_DISABLE\_byte. These two shellcodes perform the same overall function, just for different offsets, with a lot of code reuse.

Here is the Equation Group PMCHECK\_DISABLE shellcode:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUhnmvWb67C5hyphenhyphen5sWPEwuYaUhdrn-5yD91otzoIqHuwqT2taoC9hiZwaJx5J9NA7RH7AmD7tMWD0EV4C_6FDqp1wcKE8LzKvh4f6GHe7FHzFNeBhmo3IZyEVw22v9z2wmsOf5dhGii6p0/s1600/payload.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUhnmvWb67C5hyphenhyphen5sWPEwuYaUhdrn-5yD91otzoIqHuwqT2taoC9hiZwaJx5J9NA7RH7AmD7tMWD0EV4C_6FDqp1wcKE8LzKvh4f6GHe7FHzFNeBhmo3IZyEVw22v9z2wmsOf5dhGii6p0/s1600/payload.png)

There's some shellcode trickery going on, but here are the steps being taken:

1. First, the syscall to mprotect() marks a page of memory as read/write/exec, so we can patch the code
2. Next, we jump forward to right before the end of the shellcode
   * The last 3 lines of the shellcode contain the code to "always return true"
3. The call instruction puts the current address (where patch code is) on the stack
4. The patch code address is pop'd into esi and we jump backwards
5. rep movs copies 4 bytes (ecx) from esi (source index) to edi (destination index), then we jump to the admauth() patch

The following is functional equivalent C code:

```

const void *PMCHECK_BOUNDS = 0x954c000;
const void *PMCHECK_OFFSET = 0x954cfd0;

const int32_t PATCH_BYTES = 0xc340c031;

sys_mprotect(PMCHECK_BOUNDS, 0x1000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC);
*PMCHECK_OFFSET = PATCH_BYTES;

```

In this case, PMCHECK\_BYTES will be "always return true".

```

xor eax, eax   ; set eax to 0  -- 31 c0
inc eax        ; increment eax -- 40
ret            ; return        -- c3
```

Yes, my friends who are fluent in shellcode, the assembly is extremely verbose just to write 4 bytes to a memory location. Here is how we summarized everything from loc\_00000025 to the end in the improved shellcode:

```
mov dword [PMCHECK_OFFSET], PMCHECK_BYTES
```

In the inverse operation, pass-enable, we will simply patch the bytes to their original values.

## Finding Offsets

So now that we've reverse engineered the shellcode, we know what offsets we need to patch to port the exploit to a new Cisco ASA version:

1. The RET smash, which should be JMP ESP (ff e4) bytes
2. The "safe" return address, to continue execution after our shellcode runs
3. The address of pmcheck()
4. The address of admauth()

### RET Smash

We can set the RET smash address to anywhere JMP ESP (ff e4) opcodes appear in an executable section of the binary. There is no shortage of the actual instruction in 9.2(3).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhki7XOe3Ddhkaw3l_o7FpX-4fcuuaWUiKiQ3Tvopouq_fnbf-Ugy9WwAJoSTwTENUVGHyHeafWVIOrwSfy9FQ6KvthAHohLZPHV1Ah1OmRi_MWR_R5XHkWgaORsnAyeVrBbQDO8hATQmM/s1600/jmpesp.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhki7XOe3Ddhkaw3l_o7FpX-4fcuuaWUiKiQ3Tvopouq_fnbf-Ugy9WwAJoSTwTENUVGHyHeafWVIOrwSfy9FQ6KvthAHohLZPHV1Ah1OmRi_MWR_R5XHkWgaORsnAyeVrBbQDO8hATQmM/s1600/jmpesp.PNG)

Any of these will do, so we just picked a random one.

### Safe Return Address

This is the location to safely return execution to after the shellcode runs. As mentioned, this part of the code isn't actually recognized as a function by IDA, and also the same trick we'll use for the Authentication Functions (searching the assembly with ROPgadget) doesn't work here.

The offset in 8.4(3) is 0xad457e33 ^ 0xa5a5a5a5 = 0x8e0db96

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5My0IvgtT9rxwidgThM4EYAP2VCEQgh6pRUun86axQzDSHXXUJ0TDMONSl7OZADYcxXbh6Ctvm9QPIXKRJZev74hWmEePCtWzDwpUMwCam_2u-hsgv5m_bBzwBzK5DqwbTDftwVa4tZs/s1600/saferet_843.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5My0IvgtT9rxwidgThM4EYAP2VCEQgh6pRUun86axQzDSHXXUJ0TDMONSl7OZADYcxXbh6Ctvm9QPIXKRJZev74hWmEePCtWzDwpUMwCam_2u-hsgv5m_bBzwBzK5DqwbTDftwVa4tZs/s1600/saferet_843.png)

This contains a very unique signature of common bytes we can grep for in 9.2(3).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjo9FNJ06R1nAXGktakcYNcnpHrf0KCzvq2cntXwMdL1Q0RY9oFAqYnqg5la0_L1WiOBVbarMLm1uwor1uYWUwiMLhldgiI1aPIoTMcDNUPpI0P7AGtXkfZyZEJq8M2T9ufiLBpjsrFw24/s1600/saferet_923.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjo9FNJ06R1nAXGktakcYNcnpHrf0KCzvq2cntXwMdL1Q0RY9oFAqYnqg5la0_L1WiOBVbarMLm1uwor1uYWUwiMLhldgiI1aPIoTMcDNUPpI0P7AGtXkfZyZEJq8M2T9ufiLBpjsrFw24/s1600/saferet_923.png)

Our safe return address offset is at 0x9277386.

### Authentication Functions

Finding the offsets for pmcheck() and admauth() is pretty simple. The offsets in 8.4(3) are not XORed by 0xa5a5a5a5, but the page alignment for sys\_mprotect() is.

We'll dump the pmcheck() function from 8.4(3).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiefnZXVPUspdmnK1iRm1Br34_1pPxNoBaGnF9pt-iC_DRu8YtmmzLyHS6PQ3wJpz_Dhw9IIubMEsNqsCSdzB95swknv3HM9SxpCWUxIXUJZ8RRYJXHr1eDKvqwNl0tCbLjQa9b2POUATo/s1600/pmcheck_843.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiefnZXVPUspdmnK1iRm1Br34_1pPxNoBaGnF9pt-iC_DRu8YtmmzLyHS6PQ3wJpz_Dhw9IIubMEsNqsCSdzB95swknv3HM9SxpCWUxIXUJZ8RRYJXHr1eDKvqwNl0tCbLjQa9b2POUATo/s1600/pmcheck_843.PNG)

We have the bytes of the function, so we can use the [Python ROPGadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) tool from Jonathan Salwan to search for those bytes in 9.2(3).

It's a pretty straightforward process, which can be repeated for admauth() offsets. Note that during this process, we get the unpatch bytes needed for the pass-enable shellcode.

Finding the page alignment boundaries for these offsets (for use in sys\_mprotect()) is easy as well, just floor to the nearest 0x1000.

## Improving the Shellcode

We were able to combine the Equation Group stages "preamble" and "payload" into a single stage by rewriting the shellcode. Here is a list of ways we shortened the exploit code:

1. Removed all XOR 0xa5a5a5a5 operations, as null bytes are allowed
2. Reused code for the two sys\_mprotect() calls
3. Used a single mov operation instead of jmp/call/pop/rep movs to patch the code
4. General shellcode size optimization tricks (performing the same tasks with ops that use less bytes)

The lackadaisical approach to the shellcode, as well as the Python code, came as a bit of surprise as the Equation Group is probably the most elite APT on the planet. There's a lot of cleverness in the code though, and whoever originally wrote it obviously had to be competent. To me, it appears the shellcode is kind of an off-the-shelf solution to solving generic problems, instead of being custom tailored for the exploit.

By changing the shellcode, we gained one enormous benefit. We no longer have to find the stack offset that contains a pointer to the third stage. This step gave us so much trouble that we started experimenting with using an [egg hunter](http://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2014/12/x64-egg-hunter-shellcode.html). We know that the stack offset to the third stage was a bottleneck for SilentSignal as well ([Bake Your Own EXTRABACON](https://blog.silentsignal.eu/2016/08/25/bake-your-own-extrabacon/)). But once we understood the overall operation of all stages, we were happy to just reduce the bytes and keep everything in the one stage. Not having to find the third stage offset makes porting the exploit very simple.

## Future Work

The Equation Group appeared to have generated their shellcode. We have written a Python script that will auto-port the code to different versions. We find offsets using similar heuristics to what ROPGadget offers. Of course, you can't trust a tool 100% (in fact, some of the Equation Group shellcode crashes certain versions). So we are testing each version.

We're also porting the Python code to Ruby, so the exploit will be part of Metasploit. Our Metasploit module will contain the new shellcode for all Shadow Broker versions, as well as offsets for numerous versions not part of the original release, so keep an eye out for it.

   loc\_039 is a little unclear. (step 3)
   is 'calling -#' to offset 36? (step 4)

     Yea the disassembler had trouble with that one, but the offset it's calling is loc\_036. The pop esi instruction.

   Hi,

   Nice post!
   Have you ever tried to attach the lina binary to gdb?
   I'm stuck with the following error.
   Some clue?

   # cat .gdbinit
   set debug remote 1
   set disassembly-flavor intel
   target remote /dev/ttyUSB0

   # gdb
   Sending packet: $Hc-1#09...putpkt: Junk: n.
   Remote debugging using /dev/ttyS0
   readchar: Input/output error
   Remote side has terminated connection. GDBserver will reopen the connection.

     From Zach:

     Happens when either: you don't set the baud rate correct (it's 9600), or the lina binary for some versions does this....if you're getting junk spewing into the terminal before connecting to gdb it most likley isn't going to work.

   Have you tried running it against a fresh asa box or undoing the changes made for remote debugging so that it starts up normally

     Yea we did the vast majority of testing for the Metasploit module (which contains about 20 other versions so far) on just a basic "boot system" .bin config.

   What are your thoughts about porting the exploit to SNMP v1 / v3 ? Is it doable or rather it's like looking for a completely new vulnerability?

     Haven't looked into it but I wouldn't rule it out without properly fuzzing it.

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco ASA Software running on the following products may be affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Cisco Firepower 4100 Series   + Cisco Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software   + Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM)**\***   + Cisco Industrial Security Appliance 3000   + Cisco PIX Firewalls**\***All versions of SNMP are affected by this vulnerability. Refer to the Fixed Software section of this security advisory for more information about the affected releases.      **\* Note:** Cisco Firewall Service Modules and Cisco PIX Firewalls have passed the last day of software support milestone as stated in the published End of Life (EoL) documents. Further investigations into these devices will not be performed, and fixed software will not be made available. Please see the following EoL documents for further information:   + Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM)     <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/interfaces-modules/catalyst-6500-series-firewall-services-module/eol_c51-699134.html>   + Cisco PIX Firewalls     <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/pix-500-series-security-appliances/eos-eol-notice-listing.html>Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have SNMP access and to monitor affected systems using the **snmp-server** host command.      The [SNMP](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/configuration/general/asa-96-general-config/monitor-snmp.html) chapter of the *Cisco ASA Series General Operations CLI Configuration Guide* explains how SNMP is configured in the Cisco ASA.      The attacker must know the community strings to successfully launch an attack against an affected device. Community strings are passwords that are applied to an ASA device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be carefully chosen to ensure they are not trivial. Community strings should be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the company.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
