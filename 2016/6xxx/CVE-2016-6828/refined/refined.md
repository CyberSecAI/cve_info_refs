{
    "CVE-2016-6828": {
        "Root cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue` and other `tcp_*` functions due to improper handling when a user data copy fails during `tcp_sendmsg`, leaving a dangling pointer to a freed skb.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Use-After-Free",
            "Dangling pointer"
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker could potentially send incorrect selective acknowledgments to existing connections, possibly resetting the connection or, in some scenarios, triggering a kernel crash.",
        "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers could trigger the vulnerability by sending an incorrect selective acknowledgment to existing connections.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to an existing TCP connection."
