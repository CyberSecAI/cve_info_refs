Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6816:

**1. Verification:**

The official CVE description for CVE-2016-6816 states: "The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response."

The content from `tomcat.apache.org` confirms this description. It clearly states that the code parsing HTTP request lines in Tomcat permitted invalid characters which could lead to information disclosure, XSS attacks, and web-cache poisoning if used in combination with a proxy.  Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from Tomcat's HTTP request line parsing code allowing invalid characters, which a proxy may interpret differently than Tomcat, which can be exploited to inject data into HTTP responses.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Improper parsing of HTTP request lines that allows invalid characters to be processed.
    *   Tomcat's failure to sanitize user input that is later used to construct HTTP responses.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data from requests, including session IDs, may be exposed to unintended users by injecting data into HTTP responses.
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Attacker-controlled data injected into the HTTP response can be used to execute malicious JavaScript code in a victim's browser.
    *   **Web Cache Poisoning:** Injected data can manipulate how web caches store responses, which may cause a cache to return malicious content to other users.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   By sending HTTP requests with invalid characters in the request line, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
    *   This vulnerability is often exploited when Tomcat is situated behind a proxy that handles invalid characters differently from Tomcat.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests containing invalid characters to the target Tomcat server.
    *   A vulnerable reverse proxy that is in front of the target Tomcat server and misinterprets the invalid characters is required to fully exploit request smuggling.

**3. Additional details from content:**

*   The provided document includes the specific commit hashes that fix the vulnerability across various Tomcat versions:

    *   Tomcat 8.5.8: `1767645`
    *   Tomcat 8.0.39: `1767653`
    *   Tomcat 7.0.73: `1767675`
    *   Tomcat 6.0.48: `1767683`
*   Red Hat Bugzilla also notes that applying the fix could result in HTTP 400 errors from clients sending such invalid characters, and a new property was introduced to allow these invalid characters.
* The NetApp advisory clarifies that successful exploitation could result in information disclosure, data modification or denial of service.

**4. Summary:**
The CVE-2016-6816 vulnerability is caused by improper parsing of invalid characters in HTTP request lines in Apache Tomcat. When paired with a reverse proxy that interprets the same invalid characters differently, it can lead to request smuggling, information disclosure, XSS, and/or web cache poisoning. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send requests with these invalid characters and often relies on the specific behavior of reverse proxies placed before Tomcat servers. This vulnerability can be mitigated by updating Tomcat and/or properly sanitizing HTTP inputs by using a strict reverse proxy, and ensuring the `rejectIllegalHeader` to `true` is set for cases where there is no reverse proxy.
