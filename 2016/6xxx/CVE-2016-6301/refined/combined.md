Vendor description:
-------------------
"Securely connecting your small business to the outside world is as important
as connecting your internal network devices to one another. Cisco Small
Business RV Series Routers offer virtual private networking (VPN) technology
so your remote workers can connect to your network through a secure Internet
pathway."

Source: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/index.html>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
We want to thank Cisco for the very quick and professional response and great
coordination. Customers are urged to update the firmware of their devices.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH on an emulated device at least.

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.19 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7547, "getaddrinfo() buffer overflow")
was verified by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.23.2 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Vulnerabilities - IoT Inspector Report
Further information can be found in IoT Inspector report:
<https://r.sec-consult.com/ciscoiot>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The following hardcoded hashes were found in the 'shadow' file of the firmware:
root:$1$hPNSjUZA$7eKqEpqVYltt9xJ6f0OGf0:15533:0:99999:7:::
debug-admin:$1$.AAm0iJ4$na9wZwly9pSrdS8MhcGKw/:15541:0:99999:7:::
[...]

The undocumented user 'debug-admin' is also contained in this file.

Starting the dropbear daemon as background process on emulated firmware:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# dropbear -E
# [1109] <timestamp> Running in background
#
# [1112] <timestamp> Child connection from <IP>:52718
[1112] <timestamp> /var must be owned by user or root, and not writable by others
[1112] <timestamp> Password auth succeeded for 'debug-admin' from <IP>:52718
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log on via another host connected to the same network. For this PoC the
password of the debug-admin was changed in the 'shadow' file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost medusa]# ssh debug-admin@<IP> /bin/ash -i
debug-admin@<IP>'s password:
/bin/ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

/tmp $
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'debug-admin' user has the same privileges like 'root'. This can be
determined from the corresponding sudoers file in the firmware:
[...]
## User privilege specification
##
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
debug-admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
[...]

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.19 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402, CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472,
CVE-2015-5277, CVE-2015-8778, CVE-2015-8779, CVE-2017-1000366 and more.

The getaddrinfo() buffer overflow vulnerability was checked with the help of
the exploit code from <https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

# python cve-2015-7547-poc.py &
[1] 961
# chroot /medusa_rootfs/ bin/ash

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.23.2 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147, CVE-2018-20679,
CVE-2017-16544 and CVE-2019-5747.
The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device:

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Securely connecting your small business to the outside world is as important
as connecting your internal network devices to one another. Cisco Small
Business RV Series Routers offer virtual private networking (VPN) technology
so your remote workers can connect to your network through a secure Internet
pathway."

Source: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/index.html>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
We want to thank Cisco for the very quick and professional response and great
coordination. Customers are urged to update the firmware of their devices.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH on an emulated device at least.

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.19 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7547, "getaddrinfo() buffer overflow")
was verified by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.23.2 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Vulnerabilities - IoT Inspector Report
Further information can be found in IoT Inspector report:
<https://r.sec-consult.com/ciscoiot>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The following hardcoded hashes were found in the 'shadow' file of the firmware:
root:$1$hPNSjUZA$7eKqEpqVYltt9xJ6f0OGf0:15533:0:99999:7:::
debug-admin:$1$.AAm0iJ4$na9wZwly9pSrdS8MhcGKw/:15541:0:99999:7:::
[...]

The undocumented user 'debug-admin' is also contained in this file.

Starting the dropbear daemon as background process on emulated firmware:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# dropbear -E
# [1109] <timestamp> Running in background
#
# [1112] <timestamp> Child connection from <IP>:52718
[1112] <timestamp> /var must be owned by user or root, and not writable by others
[1112] <timestamp> Password auth succeeded for 'debug-admin' from <IP>:52718
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log on via another host connected to the same network. For this PoC the
password of the debug-admin was changed in the 'shadow' file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost medusa]# ssh debug-admin@<IP> /bin/ash -i
debug-admin@<IP>'s password:
/bin/ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

/tmp $
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'debug-admin' user has the same privileges like 'root'. This can be
determined from the corresponding sudoers file in the firmware:
[...]
## User privilege specification
##
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
debug-admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
[...]

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.19 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402, CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472,
CVE-2015-5277, CVE-2015-8778, CVE-2015-8779, CVE-2017-1000366 and more.

The getaddrinfo() buffer overflow vulnerability was checked with the help of
the exploit code from <https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

# python cve-2015-7547-poc.py &
[1] 961
# chroot /medusa_rootfs/ bin/ash

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1363710#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-03 12:11:59 UTC  ``` The busybox NTP implementation doesn't check the NTP mode of packets received on the server port and responds to any packet with the right size. This includes responses from another NTP server. An attacker can send a packet with a spoofed source address in order to create an infinite loop of responses between two busybox NTP servers. Adding more packets to the loop increases the traffic between the servers until one of them has a fully loaded CPU and/or network.  It seems this bug was actually inherited from openntpd, on which the busybox implementation was based on. In openntpd it was fixed in:  <https://github.com/openntpd-portable/openntpd-openbsd/commit/28a2f904aafbf4c209fe6fa04ffb9308740fd78a>  Busybox upstream patch:  <https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=150dc7a2b483b8338a3e185c478b4b23ee884e71>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1363710#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-03 12:12:08 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Miroslav Lichvar (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1363710#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-03 12:12:22 UTC  ```  Created busybox tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1363711](show_bug.cgi?id=1363711 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2016-6301 busybox: NTP server denial of service flaw [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

ntpd: respond only to client and symmetric active packetsThe busybox NTP implementation doesn't check the NTP mode of packets
received on the server port and responds to any packet with the right
size. This includes responses from another NTP server. An attacker can
send a packet with a spoofed source address in order to create an
infinite loop of responses between two busybox NTP servers. Adding
more packets to the loop increases the traffic between the servers
until one of them has a fully loaded CPU and/or network.

Subject: CVE-2016-6301: busybox: NTP server denial of service flaw

Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat reported a flaw in busybox's NTP
implementation:

The busybox NTP implementation doesn't check the NTP mode of packets
received on the server port and responds to any packet with the right
size. This includes responses from another NTP server. An attacker can
send a packet with a spoofed source address in order to create an
infinite loop of responses between two busybox NTP servers. Adding more
packets to the loop increases the traffic between the servers until one
of them has a fully loaded CPU and/or network.

=======================================================================
              title: Multiple Vulnerabilities
            product: ZTE mobile Hotspot MS910S
 vulnerable version: DL_MF910S_CN_EUV1.00.01
      fixed version: -
         CVE number: CVE-2019-3422

Vendor description:
-------------------
"ZTE Corporation is a global leader in telecommunications and information
technology. Founded in 1985 and listed on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock
Exchanges, the company has been committed to providing integrated end-to-end
innovations to deliver excellence and value to consumers, carriers, businesses
and public sector customers from over 160 countries around the world to enable

Source: <https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/corporate_information>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor recommends to change the hardware and use a newer product.

SEC Consult recommends to remove the device from productive environments.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The hard-coded administrator password was found in the ZTE mobile hotspot
MS910S firmware version "CN_EUV1.00.01", which is available at.
<http://devicedownload.zte.com.cn/support/product/201701161506340/soft/20170116151106465.zip>

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.15.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scalable firmware run-time.

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
An unusual "telnetd" port was identified on an emulated device which led to the
assumption that a backdoor can be opened via the GoAhead web-server.
This conclusion was done because of a blog post from another researcher:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

By partially reverse engineering the binaries of the GoAhead webserver, the
functionality described in the corresponding blog post can be underpinned.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The firmware file (ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin) is using the JFFS2 filesystem which
was extracted. The hardcoded password can be found in the /etc/shadow file
within the firmware:

/_DL_MF910S_CN_EUV1.00.01.exe.extracted/Data/version/_ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin.extracted/jffs2-root/fs_1/etc/shadow

The file content is shown below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
Admin:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
bin::10933:0:99999:7:::
daemon::10933:0:99999:7:::
adm::10933:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
sync:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
shutdown:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
halt:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
uucp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
operator:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
nobody::10933:0:99999:7:::
ap71::10933:0:99999:7:::
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the user "root" and "admin" are using the same weak hardcoded password
"5up".

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was crea-
ted to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
Starting the telnet daemon on the emulated device leads to a listener on a very
unusual port:
[...]
# telnetd
#netstat -tulen
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4719            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
[...]

Because this seems to be not configured on the system by any file, the BusyBox
binary was inspected.

The pseudocode snippet of BusyBox' telnetd function that was generated by Hex-
Rays ARM Decompiler, indicated that this port was hard-coded:
<snip>
dword_788DC = (int)"/bin/login";
  dword_788E0 = (int)"/etc/issue.net";
  v3 = sub_5DBFC(a2, "f:l:Kip:b:F", &dword_788E0, &dword_788DC, &v76, &v75);
  v4 = v3 & 8;
  v5 = v3;
  if ( !(v3 & 8) && !(v3 & 0x40) )
    sub_64A10(v3 & 8);
  if ( (v5 & 0x48) != 64 )
  {
    openlog((const char *)dword_798DC, 1, 24);
    dword_78630 = 2;
  }
  if ( v5 & 0x10 )
    v6 = sub_64FF8(v76);
  else
    v6 = 4719; <------------------------------------- Port "4719"
  if ( !v4 )
  {
    v2 = sub_65578(v75, v6);
    sub_E394(v2, 1);
    sub_D9B0(v2);
    goto LABEL_13;
  }
  dword_788D8 = (int)sub_1C480(0);
  if ( dword_788D8 )
  {
<snip>

This led to the assumption that the GoAhead webserver was modified like
described in the following blog post:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

Inspecting the GoAhead webserver binary reinforces this assumption. The
pseudocode was generated with Hex-Rays ARM Decompiler, like for the prior
BusyBox binary:
<snip>
int __fastcall sub_21D48(int a1)
{
  int v1; // r5
  const char *v2; // r4

  v1 = a1;
  cfg_get("debug_level");
  v2 = (const char *)sub_17DF0(v1, "change_mode", "");
  cfg_set("login_9527", "1");
  if ( !strcmp("1", v2) )
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "1");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 1");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("2", v2) ) <--- change mode "2"
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("telnetd &"); <--------- telnet daemon started
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("3", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_start.sh &");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("4", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_kill.sh &");
  }
  else
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "0");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 0");
  }
  return sub_34374(v1, "success");
}
<snip>

Other scripts could also be started via the webserver, like "rem_start.sh".
This script contains the following lines:

#!/bin/sh
if ps|grep remserial
then
echo "remserial is running.."
else
remserial -p 10005 -r 192.168.1.10 -s "115200 raw" /dev/ttyUSB0 &
fi

That means, that a serial console with the speed of 115200 Baud on port 10005
is started.

We are providing this code as-is. You are responsible for protecting yourself,
your property and data, and others from any risks caused by this code. This
code may cause unexpected and undesirable behavior to occur on your machine.
This code may not detect the vulnerability on your system.

Note that this POC consists of two components: server code and client code.
The server code triggers the vulnerability and therefore will crash the client
code. Note also that it is necessary to set the nameserver to point to the
server code, and doing so could cause other programs that call into the
getaddrinfo() function to crash while testing is underway. This POC code is
provided "as is" with no warranties, whether express or implied, including
without limitation any warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular
use and noninfringement. Google assumes no responsibility for your proper
installation and use of the POC code.

# BusyBox: Denial of service — GLSA **201701-05**

A vulnerability in BusyBox might allow remote attackers to cause a
Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-apps/busybox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.25.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.25.1** |

### Background

BusyBox is a set of tools for embedded systems and is a replacement for
GNU Coreutils.

### Description

The recv\_and\_process\_client\_pkt function in networking/ntpd.c in BusyBox
allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service (CPU and bandwidth
consumption) via a forged NTP packet, which triggers a communication
loop.

### Impact

A remote attacker might send a specially crafted package to a machine
running BusyBox ntpd, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All BusyBox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/busybox-1.25.1"

```

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review of these products
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.18.5 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

2) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-9436)
An authenticated command injection vulnerability can be triggered by issuing a
POST request to the "/cgi-bin/p/adm/cfg" CGI program which is available on the
web interface. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to compromise the
operating system of the device. This issue was found by emulating the firmware
of the device.

3) Embedded Private X.509 Certificate (CVE-2020-9435)
The device contains a hardcoded certificate which can be used to run the web
service. This certificate is used for HTTPS (default server certificate for
web based configuration and management).

Impersonation, man-in-the-middle or passive decryption attacks are possible.
These attacks allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information like
admin credentials and use them in further attacks.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.18.5 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2014-9645 and CVE-2013-1813.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device:

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-9436)
An authenticated command injection is possible via a crafted POST request.

The configuration upload form in the web-interface can be used to upload an XML
configuration file. The filename of this XML file can be modified with an
interceptor proxy in order to inject system commands. The JavaScript code which
is used to do client-side filtering can be bypassed in this way. Because of
blacklisting of some characters, the ${IFS} command must be used for adding
whitespaces.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.
