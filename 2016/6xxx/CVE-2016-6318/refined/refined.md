Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6318:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `FascistGecosUser` function within the `lib/fascist.c` file of Cracklib. This overflow occurs when parsing a long GECOS field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `longbuffer` in `FascistGecosUser` is of a fixed size. When processing a GECOS field, the code concatenates data into this buffer without proper bounds checking. If the GECOS field contains data that, when processed, exceeds the buffer's size, a buffer overflow occurs on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service:** The primary impact observed in many cases is an application crash due to the buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service where the application becomes unusable.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** In environments where cracklib is not compiled with stack protection mechanisms like FORTIFY_SOURCE, a successful buffer overflow can overwrite stack memory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application. This could lead to privilege escalation, especially when the application runs with elevated privileges (e.g. `passwd` running as setuid root).

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local user:** A local user can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a long GECOS field via the `chfn` command.
- **Vulnerable applications:** After crafting the GECOS field, the user would need to run applications that use Cracklib (such as `passwd`) to parse the GECOS field, triggering the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** Attackers must have local access to the system.
- **Ability to modify GECOS field:** Attackers must be able to modify their own user's GECOS field (e.g., via `chfn`).
- **Triggering application:** Attackers need to run applications that utilize the cracklib library to process the modified GECOS field.

**Additional details from provided content:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported by Raed Albuliwi of CSG Labs to Red Hat.
- Red Hat confirmed that their builds of cracklib use FORTIFY_SOURCE, mitigating the arbitrary code execution risk to an application crash.
- The vulnerability affects multiple SUSE and openSUSE distributions.
- A patch was proposed by Red Hat, but it was found to be insufficient. A more complete patch was developed by SUSE.
- Several test cases were developed, including specific test cases for SLE11 and SLE12 distributions.
- The vulnerability affects various packages and product versions across multiple Linux distributions, including Debian and Gentoo.
- SUSE assigned a CVSS v2 score of 4.4 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) to this issue, while the NVD gave it a CVSS v2 score of 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C). The NVD also provided a CVSS v3 score of 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
