Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6462:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the email filtering functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA). Specifically, the way the software processes MIME headers allows for a bypass of Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) filters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper processing of MIME headers leading to a filter bypass.
- The vulnerability is present in the email filtering mechanism when AMP is configured to scan incoming email attachments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass AMP filters, potentially delivering malicious attachments that would otherwise be blocked.
- This could lead to successful malware delivery to systems within the affected network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, network-based attack via email.
- The attacker sends a crafted email with a malicious attachment, leveraging the MIME header processing vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the target system.
- They need to be able to send emails to an affected Cisco Email Security Appliance that has the AMP feature enabled for scanning incoming email attachments.
- The attacker needs to craft emails with specific MIME headers that exploit the vulnerability to bypass the AMP filter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco AsyncOS software for both virtual and hardware versions of Cisco ESA, before the first fixed release, when AMP is configured.
- There are no known workarounds to this issue other than upgrading to the fixed version.
- The provided CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C, with a base score of 5.0 and a temporal score of 4.1 which indicates the following:
    - Access Vector: Network (N)
