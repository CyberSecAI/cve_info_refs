### The HipChat plugin for various products leaks the secret key it uses to communicate with a linked HipChat instance (CVE-2016-6668)

**Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

**Description**

The Atlassian Hipchat Integration Plugin for Bitbucket Server exposed the secret key it used to communicate with a linked HipChat service in various administration pages. For this vulnerability to affect your Bitbucket Server instance you must have a HipChat integration established. To exploit this issue, attackers must have Admin access to a Bitbucket Server. Using the secret key attackers could gain full control over a linked HipChat instance.

All versions of **Atlassian Hipchat Integration Plugin for Bitbucket Server** from **6.26.0** before **6.27.5**, from **6.28.0** before **7.3.7** and from**7.4.0** before **7.8.17** are affected by this vulnerability.

All versions of **Bitbucket Server** from 3.10.0 before **4.4.4**(the fixed version for 4.4.x), from **4.5.0**before**4.5.3** (the fixed version for 4.5.x), **4.6.0**before**4.6.4** (the fixed version for 4.6.x), **4.7.0**before**4.7.2** (the fixed version for 4.7.x) and from **4.8.0** before **4.8.4**are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:

## **What You Need to Do**

**Upgrade (recommended)**

The vulnerabilities and fix versions are described in the description section above. Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest version.

**Upgrade Bitbucket Server to version 4.9.0****or higher.**

If you are running**Bitbucket Server****and** **cannot upgrade to****Bitbucket Server 4.9.0 or higher****then****upgrade to one of the fixed versions listed below**

* 4.4.4
* 4.5.3
* 4.6.4
* 4.7.2
* 4.8.4

If you are running **Stash 3.11** then download the JARs from [here](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-9146) and install them using the instructions for installing add-ons using UPM found at [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Installing+add-ons#Installingadd-ons-Installingbyfileupload](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Installing%2Badd-ons#Installingadd-ons-Installingbyfileupload) **after which you must restart** **Stash**. Version 6.27.5 (which contains a fix) of the Atlassian Hipchat Integration Plugin should be installed.

#### Next, follow these steps to **rotate the secret key.**

You need admin permissions for both Bitbucket Server and HipChat to do this:

1. Log in to Bitbucket Server as a user with admin permissions and go to <your-bitbucket-server-site>/plugins/servlet/hipchat/configure
2. Click ***Remove integration****.*This will sever the link and uninstall the add-on in HipChat.
3. Once you land back on the HipChat Integration page, click ***Connect HipChat***. This will re-establish the link between HipChat and Bitbucket Server with a new secret key.

### The HipChat plugin for various products leaks the secret key it uses to communicate with a linked HipChat instance (CVE-2016-6668)

**Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

**Description**

The HipChat for JIRA plugin exposed the secret key it used to communicate with a linked HipChat service in various pages. For this vulnerability to affect your JIRA instance you must have a HipChat integration established. To exploit this issue in JIRA versions 7.0.0 and higher, attackers need to have access to a JIRA account. In JIRA versions before 7.0.0, such as 6.4.x, attackers only need access to the JIRA web interface. Using the secret key attackers can gain full control over a linked HipChat instance.

All versions of **HipChat for JIRA plugin** from 6.26.0 before **7.8.17** are affected by this vulnerability.

All versions of **JIRA** from 6.4.8 before **7.0.11**(the fixed version for 7.0.x) and from **7.1.0**before **7.1.10**(the fixed version for 7.1.x) are affected by this vulnerability are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:

The HipChat for JIRA plugin marketplace entry can be found at [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.labs.hipchat.hipchat-for-JIRA-plugin/server/overview](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.labs.hipchat.hipchat-for-jira-plugin/server/overview).

**If you cannot upgrade the HipChat For JIRA Plugin to version 7.8.17 or higher then****upgrade JIRA to version 7.2.0****or higher.**

#### Next, follow these steps to **rotate the secret key.**

You need admin permissions for both JIRA and HipChat to do this:

1. Log in to JIRA as a user with admin permissions and go to <your-jira-site>/plugins/servlet/hipchat/configure
2. Click ***Remove integration****.*This will sever the link and uninstall the add-on in HipChat.
3. Once you land back on the HipChat Integration page, click ***Connect HipChat***. This will re-establish the link between HipChat and JIRA with a new secret key.

For a full description of the latest version of JIRA, see [the release notes](/adminjira/jira-7-2-x-platform-release-notes-826896232.html). You can download the latest version of JIRA from [the download centre](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/download).

**Description**

The Confluence HipChat plugin exposed the secret key it used to communicate with a linked HipChat service in various pages.

* Space admin permission for any space
* Confluence Administrator or System Administrator permission

Using the secret key attackers can gain full control over a linked HipChat instance.

All versions of **Confluence** from 5.9.1 before **5.9.14** (the fixed version for 5.9.x) and from **5.10.0**before **5.10.4**(the fixed version for 5.10.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:
