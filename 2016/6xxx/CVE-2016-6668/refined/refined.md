Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the HipChat plugin for various Atlassian products (Bitbucket Server, JIRA, and Confluence) exposing the secret key used for communication with a linked HipChat instance. This key was exposed in various administration pages of the affected products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Secret Key Exposure:** The core issue is the exposure of a sensitive secret key within the administrative interface of the affected Atlassian products.
*   **Insecure Plugin:** The HipChat plugin itself is the source of the vulnerability, as it incorrectly handles the storage and display of the secret key.
*   **Lack of Input Validation or Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize or protect the secret key before displaying it on admin pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Control of Linked HipChat Instance:** An attacker with access to the exposed secret key can gain complete control over the associated HipChat instance. This allows them to potentially read, modify, and delete data within HipChat.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can access and modify HipChat conversations, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Admin Pages:** An attacker needs access to the administrative pages of the affected Atlassian product (Bitbucket Server, JIRA, or Confluence) where the secret key is exposed.
*   **Web Interface Access:** For older JIRA versions before 7.0.0, an attacker only needs access to the web interface.
*   **Specific User Permissions:** For Confluence, the attacker needs user access with "Create space," "Space admin" permissions, or Confluence/System administrator permissions.
*  **Admin Access:** In Bitbucket Server, an attacker needs admin access. In JIRA versions 7.0.0 and higher, attackers need a JIRA account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication/Authorization:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and authorized to access the relevant administrative pages of Bitbucket Server, JIRA, or Confluence.
*   **Privileged Access:** Depending on the product and version, the attacker may need varying levels of access, ranging from web interface access to space admin privileges to system administrator privileges.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **Bitbucket Server:**
    *   Plugin versions: 6.26.0 <= version < 6.27.5, 6.28.0 <= version < 7.3.7, 7.4.0 <= version < 7.8.17
    *   Product versions: 3.10.0 <= version < 4.4.4, 4.5.0 <= version < 4.5.3, 4.6.0 <= version < 4.6.4, 4.7.0 <= version < 4.7.2, 4.8.0 <= version < 4.8.4
*   **JIRA:**
    *   Plugin versions: 6.26.0 <= version < 7.8.17
    *   Product versions: >= 6.2.5 with plugin version >= 6.26.0 and < 7.8.17, 6.4.8 <= version < 7.0.11, 7.1.0 <= version < 7.1.10
*   **Confluence:**
    *   Plugin versions: 6.26.0 <= version < 7.8.17
    *  Product versions: >= 5.5.0 with plugin version >= 6.26.0 and < 7.8.17, 5.9.1 <= version < 5.9.14, 5.10.0 <= version < 5.10.4

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade:** Update the affected Atlassian products to the fixed versions that include the patched HipChat plugin or upgrade the HipChat plugin to version 7.8.17 or higher.
*   **Temporary Workaround:** Disable or uninstall the HipChat plugin as a temporary measure until an upgrade can be performed.
*   **Secret Key Rotation:** After upgrading, it is essential to rotate the secret key by removing and reconnecting the HipChat integration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is rated as "critical" by Atlassian.
*   The advisory recommends that all affected users should upgrade immediately.
*   The issue is tracked under BSERV-9146 for Bitbucket Server, JRA-62496 for JIRA, and CONF-43695 for Confluence.
