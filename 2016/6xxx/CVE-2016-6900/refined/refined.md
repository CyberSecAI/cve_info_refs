- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A resource management vulnerability exists in the iBMC (Intelligent Baseboard Management Controller) of some Huawei servers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The iBMC is susceptible to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust iBMC resources, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers who have access to the device's shell.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the device's shell to exploit this vulnerability. They can then create numerous processes, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
