Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a double-fetch issue in the `sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb` function within the S/390 character device driver. The function retrieves data from user space using the `copy_from_user` function. It fetches the length of a request from user space data, then fetches the complete request using this length. A race condition exists where a malicious user could modify the length value between the first and second fetches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Fetch:** The driver fetches the length of the request, and then the complete request, potentially using different length values.
*   **Race Condition:** A user-space process can modify the length of the request between the two fetches, causing inconsistencies.
*   **Missing Bounds Check:** The code checks if the length is within the page size, but it does not check that the fetched length is equal to or smaller than the size of the provided user space buffer

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Leakage:** If a user manipulates the length, the kernel could read data beyond the user-provided buffer in kernel memory, leading to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local User:** A local user with access to the `/dev/sclp` device can trigger this vulnerability by manipulating the length field of the data passed to the `ioctl` call.
*   **Malicious application:** A malicious application can exploit this race condition through the ioctl system call to cause information leakage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be a local user with the ability to interact with the `/dev/sclp` device, and be able to make `ioctl` system calls.
*   The attacker needs to be able to run a thread that can modify the length field concurrently with the `copy_from_user` operations within the kernel driver.

**Technical Details:**
1.  The `sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb` function receives a pointer to user space data `user_area`.
2.  It copies a structure `ctl_sccb` which contains a user space pointer `sccb` to the request.
3.  The driver first fetches the `sccb` struct from user space to a kernel buffer.
4.  The `sccb` structure contains a `length` field that specifies the size of the data.
5.  The driver uses this length to fetch the whole message again from user space.
6.  If a malicious user changes the length between the first and second `copy_from_user` calls, the second fetch could read beyond the bounds of the user provided buffer.
7.  The fix involves using the initially copied data size, and ensuring that the size is less than the total copied buffer.
