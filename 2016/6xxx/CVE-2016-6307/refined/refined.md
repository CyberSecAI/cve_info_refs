{
  "CVE-2016-6307": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The state-machine implementation in OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allocates memory before checking for an excessive length.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory Exhaustion"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted TLS messages.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker sending crafted TLS messages."
  }
