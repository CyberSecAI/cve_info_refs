Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows that allows for local privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows a local attacker to install and execute arbitrary executable files with *SYSTEM* privileges.
- This indicates an issue with the way the Cisco AnyConnect client handles permissions or executes certain actions, allowing for privilege escalation.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-264 which refers to "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected Windows system. This includes the ability to execute arbitrary code, install malware, modify system configurations, and access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have already gained access to the target Windows system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated and have local access to the vulnerable Windows system where the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all software releases of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client earlier than the first fixed releases of 4.2.05015 and 4.3.02039.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by a security researcher from ERNW.
- The CVSS base score is 6.8 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C) and temporal score of 5.3 (E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C), which indicates a medium severity.
- The exploit is considered "Proof-of-Concept", meaning a practical exploit may not be readily available, but one exists.
