Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the 802.11 wireless LAN protocol implementation on Cisco Access Point (AP) platforms. Specifically, a flaw allows a crafted or malicious 802.11 frame or sequence of frames to be sent to a vulnerable access point, resulting in unexpected device reload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-119:** This indicates a classic memory corruption or improper bounds check vulnerability that is triggered by the malicious 802.11 traffic. It is likely that the device does not properly validate the size or format of the incoming 802.11 frame, leading to a buffer overflow or other memory error during processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation causes the affected Cisco AP to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service condition for wireless clients connected to that AP. This means wireless connectivity for users would be disrupted.
*   The CVSS score indicates that only availability is impacted (A:C), with no confidentiality or integrity impact (C:N, I:N).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Attack:** The attacker must be within wireless range of the vulnerable access point to send malicious 802.11 frames. They need not be authenticated to the wireless network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** An attacker does not need to authenticate to the wireless network to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in physical proximity to the vulnerable access point to transmit malicious 802.11 traffic within the range of the device's wireless signal.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft or inject malicious 802.11 frames.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 series APs running software versions prior to 8.2.121.0 or 8.3.102.0.
*   No workarounds are available, so applying the fix is the only way to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public exploitation of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS base score of 6.1, with a temporal score of 5.0.
