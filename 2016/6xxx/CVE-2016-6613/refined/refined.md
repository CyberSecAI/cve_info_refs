Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from phpMyAdmin's handling of symlinks when the `UploadDir` configuration is enabled. A user can create a symbolic link within the `UploadDir` that points to a file outside of their normal access scope. phpMyAdmin, having permission to read the target of the symlink, will then expose the contents of that file to the user through its interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of files that the user should not have direct access to, violating the principle of least privilege.
- **Insecure Symlink Handling:** phpMyAdmin does not properly validate or restrict the target of symbolic links created within the `UploadDir`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to sensitive information contained in files that they are not normally authorized to read. The impact depends on what files the attacker can access with the symlink.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink within the directory specified by the `UploadDir` configuration option.
- **Web Interface Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by accessing phpMyAdmin through its web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **`UploadDir` Configuration:** The phpMyAdmin installation must be configured with the `UploadDir` option enabled.
- **Symlink Creation:** The user must have the ability to create symlinks within the `UploadDir` on the file system where phpMyAdmin is installed.
- **Read Access:** The user running the phpMyAdmin application needs to have read permissions to the target of the crafted symlink.
- **phpMyAdmin User Account**: The attacker must have a phpMyAdmin user account, which allows them to access the upload functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content from `phpmyadmin.net` provides the most comprehensive description of the vulnerability, including mitigation factors and affected versions.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory lists CVE-2016-6613 as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities affecting phpMyAdmin, but doesn't provide specific details about it.
