- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input validation vulnerabilities in the Camera driver of Huawei smart phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of parameters sent to the Camera driver. Specifically, the driver does not properly validate input parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows attackers to either crash the system or escalate user privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application installed on the smartphone sends crafted parameters to the Camera driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application. The application must be able to send specific parameters to the Camera driver.
