Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6486:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in insecure file permissions within the Siemens SINEMA Server application folder. Specifically, the executables for new system services are stored in directories where all users have full control, allowing them to swap the legitimate executables with malicious ones.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure File Permissions (CWE-284):** The vulnerability stems from improper access control, specifically related to the file permissions within the SINEMA Server application folder. This allows any authenticated local user to modify critical system service executables.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges. By replacing legitimate system service executables with malicious ones, the attacker gains the ability to run commands in the context of the highly privileged SYSTEM account. This allows the attacker to gain full control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local to the system running the Siemens SINEMA Server. This means the attacker needs to already have some form of access to the machine in order to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **File Replacement:** The specific method of attack involves replacing legitimate system service executables with malicious ones.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log into the system hosting the vulnerable Siemens SINEMA Server.
*  **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the operating system.

**Additional details:**
* The advisory mentions that authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires user interaction, though the required user interaction is likely limited to simply logging into the system.
* A low skill level is sufficient for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.
*  Siemens has released an update to correct the issue (SINEMA Server V13 SP2).

**CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 score of 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), and a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

The information from both the ZDI and ICS-CERT advisories provides a thorough overview of the vulnerability.
