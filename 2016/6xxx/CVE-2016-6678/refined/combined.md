*Co-authored by Michael Goberman.*

In recent months, the [X-Force Application Security Research Team](http://www.ibm.com/security/xforce/research.html) has discovered several previously undisclosed Android vulnerabilities. The [November 2016](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-11-01.html) and [January 2017](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-01-01.html) Android Security Bulletins included patches to one high-severity vulnerability, CVE-2016-8467, in Nexus 6 and 6P. Our new paper, “[Attacking Nexus 6 & 6P Custom Bootmodes](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Attacking-Nexus-6-and-6P-Custom-Bootmodes-5985d26456a31dd4d21a7d6ee065bb1b),” discusses this vulnerability as well as CVE-2016-6678.

## Custom Boot Modes

The paper describes how an attacker can use [PC malware](https://threatpost.com/dualtoy-windows-trojan-attacks-android-ios-devices/120556/) or [malicious chargers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/beware-of-juice-jacking/) to reboot a Nexus 6 or 6P device and implement a special boot configuration, or boot mode, which instructs Android to turn on various extra USB interfaces.

## Accessing the Nexus 6 Modem Diagnostics

These interfaces, notably the modem diagnostics interface, give attackers access to additional functionalities. This allows them to take over the Nexus 6 modem, thus compromising confidentiality and integrity.

Access to the modem enables attackers to intercept phone calls, for example. The image below depicts the waveform of the receive channel of a successfully intercepted phone call:

Attackers can also sniff mobile data packets. The image below illustrates how we successfully sniffed Long-Term Evolution (LTE) data:

Furthermore, this level of access to the Nexus 6 modem allows attackers to find the exact GPS coordinates with detailed satellite information, place phone calls, steal call information and access or change nonvolatile (NV) items or the EFS partition.

## Triggering the Android Vulnerabilities

The PC malware or malicious charger can boot the Nexus 6/6P device with the special boot mode configuration if Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is enabled on the device. Developers use ADB for debugging, and users leverage it to sideload Android application packages (APKs) onto their devices. Once connected, the victim must authorize the PC or charger on the device if it wasn’t permanently authorized before the attack. Then, the attacker can simply issue the following commands:

`adb reboot bootloader

fastboot oem config bootmode bp-tools (N6)

fastboot oem bp-tools-on (N6, option 2)

fastboot oem enable-bp-tools (N6P)

fastboot reboot`

These commands will reboot the device with the special boot mode that enables the interfaces. Every future boot from this point forward will have the boot mode configuration enabled. This means the attack is persistent and no longer requires ADB to run, although it still requires USB access. Therefore, the attacker only needs the victim to enable ADB once. Moreover, a lucky attacker might wait for the device to be in fastboot mode, which requires no authorization from the victim. This, however, is less likely.

In addition to the above boot mode changing technique, there is another way for physical attackers to boot the device with a custom boot mode. An attacker with physical access to a device can reboot it into the fastboot mode and select BP-Tools or Factory to set the relevant boot mode configuration, as illustrated below:

## Accessing the Modem AT Interface

The vulnerability affects the Nexus 6P less severely because the modem diagnostics are disabled in the modem’s firmware, which prohibits the nefarious activities described above. There are, however, additional USB interfaces that attackers can access, such as the modem AT interface, which is also vulnerable in Nexus 6. By accessing that interface, an attacker can send or eavesdrop on SMS messages and potentially [bypass two-factor authentication](https://securityintelligence.com/news/sms-two-factor-authentication-time-to-trash-the-text/).

An attacker can also access phone call information, change various radio settings and much more.

## ADB Access

The vulnerability in 6P enables the ADB interface even if it was disabled in the developer settings user interface (UI). With access to an ADB-authorized PC, a physical attacker could open an ADB session with the device and cause the ADB host running under the victim’s PC to RSA-sign the ADB authentication token even if the PC is locked.

Such an ADB connection would enable an attacker to install malware on the device. PC malware on an ADB-authorized machine might also exploit CVE-2016-8467 to enable ADB and install Android malware. The PC malware waits for the victim to place the device in the fastboot mode to exploit the vulnerability.

## Uninitialized Kernel Memory Leakage in Nexus 6

Upon further analysis, we found that another suspicious USB interface is enabled in Nexus 6 when booted with the custom boot mode. The interface identifies itself as “Motorola Test Command.” The kernel driver responsible for this interface is f\_usbnet. Interestingly, this driver brings up an Ethernet-over-USB adapter, which can be configured from the host end. This allows for some exfiltration of network traffic.

We also discovered a vulnerability in the f\_usbnet driver itself, identified as [CVE-2016-6678](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Google-Nexus-6-f_usbnet-Kernel-Uninitialized-Memory-Leak-Over-USB-c123bbfb8ef3c70a0cd4c0172d54b0d0), in which 4–5 bytes of uninitialized kernel data are padded to every Ethernet frame carried over USB. This leak may contain sensitive data that could empower cybercriminals to exploit the system. The image below illustrates an ICMP frame that contains the leak:

## Coordinated Disclosure

The X-Force team responsibly disclosed these Android vulnerabilities to Google prior to the publication of this blog.

Google assigned a high level of severity to CVE-2016-8467 and mitigated it by forbidding a locked bootloader to boot with the dangerous boot modes. The first secure bootloader version of Nexus 6 is 71.22, released in the November 2016 Android Security Bulletin. The first secure bootloader version of Nexus 6P is 03.64, which was released as part of the January 2017 bulletin.

Google assigned moderate severity to CVE-2016-6678 and mitigated it by zeroing out the padding so that uninitialized bytes won’t leak. The patch was released as part of Android’s October 2016 bulletin.

# Android Security Bulletin—October 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published October 03, 2016 | Updated October 04, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Nexus firmware
images have also been released to the
[Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security Patch Levels of October 05, 2016 or later address these
issues. Refer to the
[documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices)
to learn how to check the security patch level. Supported Nexus devices will
receive a single OTA update with the October 05, 2016 security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on September
06, 2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues
have been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository. This
bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues are Critical security vulnerabilities in
device-specific code that could enable remote code execution within the context
of the kernel, leading to the possibility of a local permanent device
compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the
device. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as
[SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2016-10-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-10-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-10-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-10-01
    and 2016-10-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Nexus devices will receive a single OTA update with the October
  05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security Patch Levels of 2016-10-01 or later address all issues associated with
the 2016-10-01 security patch string level. Security Patch Levels of 2016-10-05
or later address all issues associated with the 2016-10-05 security patch string
level. Refer to the [help center](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705) for
instructions on how to check the security patch level. Device manufacturers that
include these updates should set the patch string level to:
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-10-01] or
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-10-05].

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch level
strings?**

This bulletin has two security patch level strings so that Android partners have
the flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level string.

Devices that use the security patch level of October 5, 2016 or newer must
include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security bulletins.

Devices that use the October 1, 2016 security patch level must include all
issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
issues reported in previous security bulletins.

**3. How do I determine which Nexus devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2016-10-01](#2016-10-01-details) and
[2016-10-05](#2016-10-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Nexus
devices* column that covers the range of affected Nexus devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Nexus devices**: If an issue affects all Nexus devices,
  the table will have “All Nexus” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
  “All Nexus” encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player and Pixel C.
* **Some Nexus devices**: If an issue doesn’t affect all Nexus
  devices, the affected Nexus devices are listed in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.
* **No Nexus devices**: If no Nexus devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have “None” in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

Researchers have found a malware family called DualToy that infects Windows PCs and sideloads malware onto connected Android and iOS devices.

A Windows Trojan called DualToy has been discovered that can side load malicious apps onto Android and iOS devices via a USB connection from an infected computer.

Researchers from Palo Alto Networks said DualToy has been in existence since January 2015, and it originally was limited to installing unwanted apps and displaying mobile ads on Android devices. About six months later, the Trojan morphed and began targeting iOS devices by installing a third-party App Store in hopes of nabbing iTunes usernames and passwords.

“When DualToy began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting Android devices… We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015. Later in 2016, a new variant appeared,” wrote senior malware researcher Claud Xiao in [a technical description of the Trojan](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/09/dualtoy-new-windows-trojan-sideloads-risky-apps-to-android-and-ios-devices/).

Researchers said once DualToy infects a Windows machine, it looks for the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes, and downloads drivers for both if they’re missing in order to infect mobile devices once connected.

“Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by additional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so severe, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile devices and how malware can be spread between platforms,” Xiao wrote.

Researchers say they have observed 8,000 unique samples of the DualToy variant to date, and add they can’t be sure how many mobile devices have been infected by the malware.

Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said.

Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques.

“This attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors… [WireLurker](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/11/wirelurker-new-era-os-x-ios-malware/) installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,” Xiao said.

So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland.

Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad.

Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim’s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple’s official iTunes for Windows software.

On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password.

The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. “The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like [ZergHelper](https://threatpost.com/rogue-ios-app-gets-boot-after-slipping-into-app-store/116414/). It also has exactly the same behavior [as AceDeceiver](https://threatpost.com/trojan-exploits-apple-drm-flaw-plants-malware-on-non-jailbroken-ios-devices/116820/). When launched for the first time, the app will ask the user to input his or her Apple ID and password,” Xiao wrote.
