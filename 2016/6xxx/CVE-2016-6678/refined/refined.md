{
  "CVE-2016-6678": {
    "Root cause": "An uninitialized kernel memory leak in the f_usbnet driver.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The f_usbnet kernel driver pads 4-5 bytes of uninitialized kernel data to every Ethernet frame sent over USB."
    ],
    "Impact": "The uninitialized kernel data leak may contain sensitive information that could be used to further compromise the system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker with physical access can boot the device into a custom boot mode using 'fastboot' commands, enabling the vulnerable USB interface.",
      "Attackers can use PC malware or malicious chargers to reboot the device into a special boot configuration."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Physical access to the device or a connected PC with ADB access. An attacker needs the device to boot into a custom boot mode. ADB access needs to be authorized."
  }
