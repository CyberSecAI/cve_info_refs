Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Dotclear v2.9.1 media manager. Specifically, the `link_type` and `q` parameters in the `/admin/media.php` script are directly used in the page's HTML output without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which means the malicious script is injected through the URL parameters and reflected back to the user's browser in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- This code could be used to:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
    - Deface the web page.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that contain malicious JavaScript code within the `q` or `link_type` parameters.
- An attacker could send these crafted URLs to a victim user, typically through phishing emails, or other methods of social engineering.
- When the victim clicks the link, the malicious code is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need direct access to the server; they only need to be able to craft malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious link while the user is logged into the vulnerable Dotclear instance.
- An attacker can also embed these crafted URLs into another web page as a hidden iframe.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `/admin/media.php` file, specifically on lines 34 and 62.
- The vulnerability is fixed in the commit: `<https://hg.dotclear.org/dotclear/rev/40d0207e520d>`
- The affected parameters are `q` and `link_type`.
- Example PoC URLs are given:
```
