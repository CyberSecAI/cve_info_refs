{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The MediaWiki API, specifically the action=parse functionality, did not check read permissions on the title provided in the 'page' parameter. This allowed users to bypass access restrictions implemented by extensions like Lockdown.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing authorization check in the API's parsing functionality (ApiParse.php)",
      "Failure to use the generic permission checking mechanism for the 'read' action on titles."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized users could access the content of pages that they were not permitted to view, effectively bypassing access restrictions set by extensions.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a URL with the API action=parse and specifying a target page in the 'page' parameter, an attacker could retrieve the content of restricted pages.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs network access to the MediaWiki instance and knowledge of the API usage. No special privileges or account access are required beyond being able to make a request to the API endpoint."
