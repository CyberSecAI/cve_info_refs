Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The default exception handler in RESTEasy did not properly validate user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input validation in the default exception handler of RESTEasy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application through the vulnerable exception handler, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Displaying misleading or harmful content

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker crafts a malicious URL with input that triggers an exception.
- The default exception handler reflects the malicious input without proper sanitization, executing the injected script in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, typically through user interaction (e.g. via a malicious link or a crafted web page that sends requests to vulnerable endpoints).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in RESTEasy versions 3.1.0.CR1 and 3.0.20.Final.
- Red Hat Satellite does not use the default ExceptionMapper, however the custom exception handler does not allow return type of text/html, which may mitigate this specific vulnerability.
- The issue affects versions of RESTEasy shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6.
