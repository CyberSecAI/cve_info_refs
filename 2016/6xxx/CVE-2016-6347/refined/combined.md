| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1372124#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2016-09-01 01:09:47 UTC  ``` It was found that the default exception handler in RESTEasy did not properly validate user input. An attacker could use this flaw to launch a relected XSS attack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1372124#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2016-09-01 01:09:51 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Mikhail Egorov (Odin)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1372124#c2)  Jason Shepherd    2016-09-01 01:11:11 UTC  ```  Created resteasy tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1372125](show_bug.cgi?id=1372125 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-6347 RESTEasy: Use of the default exception handler in RESTEasy can lead to reflected XSS attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1372124#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2017-07-14 21:15:54 UTC  ``` Created resteasy tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1471277](show_bug.cgi?id=1471277 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-6347 RESTEasy: Use of the default exception handler in RESTEasy can lead to reflected XSS attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1372124#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2018-06-13 16:58:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of RESTEasy as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Moderate. Additionally Red Hat Satellite does not use the default ExceptionMapper, and the custom exception handler does not allow return type of text/html. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1372124#c10)  Kurt Seifried    2018-06-13 16:59:35 UTC  ``` Created resteasy tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1590941](show_bug.cgi?id=1590941 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2016-6347 RESTEasy: Use of the default exception handler in RESTEasy can lead to reflected XSS attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1372124#c11)  Dinesh Prasanth    2019-10-21 19:40:55 UTC  ``` The reported issue has been fixed by rebasing to resteasy 3.0.26  Rawhide/f32: <https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1403302> F31: <https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1403312> F30: <https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1403309>  Closing this bug as CURRENTRELEASE   ``` |  |
