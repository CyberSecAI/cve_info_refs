Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way MediaWiki handled user rights in the context of CentralAuth global groups. Specifically, the `UserGetRights` hook was being called *after* the application of session-based user rights limits (`Session::getAllowedUserRights()`). This allowed CentralAuth global group rights to bypass the session's user rights restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Order of Operations:** The core weakness was the improper sequence of applying session-based rights limitations and then fetching user rights via the hook, which resulted in global groups bypassing the limits defined in the session.
- **Insufficient Privilege Restriction:**  The session rights limitations were not being correctly applied to global user groups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user could potentially gain elevated privileges beyond their intended scope. For example, a user may be able to bypass certain restrictions set by the session based user rights limits. This is a type of privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CentralAuth Global Groups:** The attack vector is through the use of CentralAuth global groups. A user who is assigned to a global group can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be a user within a CentralAuth environment that is assigned to a global group that grants them extra rights.
- They would also need to be in a MediaWiki installation running a vulnerable version.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involved moving the `UserGetRights` hook call to *before* `Session::getAllowedUserRights()` is applied. This ensures that the session's rights limits are correctly applied to all users and groups, including those from CentralAuth.
- The vulnerability was present in MediaWiki versions prior to 1.27 and fixed in version 1.27.1. It did not affect version 1.23 and 1.26 since they did not include a SessionManager.
- Patches were applied to `master`, `REL1_27`, and `fundraising/REL1_27` branches of the MediaWiki core repository.
