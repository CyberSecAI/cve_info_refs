    },
    "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Extracted Details": {
      "Root cause": "The Kaspersky Safe Browser iOS application does not validate SSL certificates when connecting to secure sites.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insecure TLS implementation",
        "Lack of proper SSL certificate validation",
         "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability"
      ],

      "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
         "Ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the server",
         "Ability to forge SSL certificates"
