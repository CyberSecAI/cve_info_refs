| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-07-27 08:21:19 UTC  ``` Once docker containers register themselves to systemd-machined by oci-register-machine, any unprivileged user could run machinectl to list every single container running in the host even if the containers do not belong to this user (including containers belong to the root user), and access sensitive information associated with any individual container including its internal IP address, OS version, running processes, and file path for its rootfs.  $ machinectl status cc8d10c7b9892b75843d200d54d34a3a cc8d10c7b9892b75843d200d54d34a3a(63633864313063376239383932623735)            Since: Mon 2016-07-25 17:55:36 UTC; 34s ago           Leader: 43494 (sleep)          Service: docker; class container             Root: /var/mnt/overlay/overlay/0429684e3da515ae4f11b8514c7b20f759613          Address: 172.17.0.2                   fe80::42:acff:fe11:2               OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.2 (Maipo)             Unit: docker-cc8d10c7b9892b75843d200d54d34a3a9435fe0f65527c254ebfd2d                   └─43494 sleep 3000  CVE request:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/156>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-07-27 08:21:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: CAI Qian (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-07-27 08:21:52 UTC  ```  Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1360635](show_bug.cgi?id=1360635 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-6349 systemd: systemd-machined: information exposure for docker containers [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c3)  Lennart Poettering    2016-08-12 09:32:16 UTC  ``` As discussed elsewhere:  This isn't really a security issue, for a couple of reasons:  - machine registration is only accessible to privileged clients.   - Read-only access to the the list of available machines and their properties is available for unprivileged clients, but this shouldn't be much of a problem. After all on UNIX/Linux unprivileged users generally get access to the process tree, which certainly carries substantially more relevant information than just the list of machines which group these processes.  - Access is controlled via the dbus policy, and thus subject to dbus policies. The above is simply the default policy, and if more restrictive policy are required it's a simple matter of putting together the right dus XML.  Thus, I believe the issue at hend is without merit and should simply be closed.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c4)  Qian Cai    2016-08-12 12:16:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Lennart Poettering from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c3)) > As discussed elsewhere: >  > This isn't really a security issue, for a couple of reasons: >  > - machine registration is only accessible to privileged clients.  >  > - Read-only access to the the list of available machines and their > properties is available for unprivileged clients, but this shouldn't be much > of a problem.

There are users use things like  gresecurity/pax kernel patches to restrict process tree only to its user or group. >  > - Access is controlled via the dbus policy, and thus subject to dbus > policies. The above is simply the default policy, and if more restrictive > policy are required it's a simple matter of putting together the right dus > XML. Right, it is up to oci-register-machine developers if they would like to pursue that route. I personally agree this is a clean solution. >  > Thus, I believe the issue at hend is without merit and should simply be > closed. I suggest leave as it is. The ball is now in oci-register-machine developers’ court to at least give users a choice between security and usability as highlighted in the children bugs if put a restrict dbus policy is too heavy weight a solution for them to pursue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c5)  Lennart Poettering    2016-08-16 10:45:13 UTC  ``` the grsecurity/pax stuff is not in the upstream kernel. Have you filed a CVE against the upstream kernel because of that, too?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1360634#c6)  Qian Cai    2016-08-16 12:33:55 UTC  ``` Not yet. I guess I could especially in the DevOps context. There are lots of things not consider security in the past and should be considered now.   ``` |  |

### @rhatdan **[rhatdan](/rhatdan)** commented [Aug 17, 2016](#issue-171655236)

oci-register-machine can be considered an information leak for

certain container workloads. It allows information about the container

to be viewed by non privileged users. Some adinistrators may want to disable

containers reporting this information to systemd-machinectl. We want this

package installed by default, and removing this package is not an option

on atomic host.

This patch adds a /etc/oci-register-machine.conf which contains a json

data to disable the tool.

Sorry, something went wrong.
