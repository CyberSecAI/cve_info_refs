Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `oci-register-machine` registers Docker containers with `systemd-machined`. When a container registers itself, `systemd-machined` exposes information about the container to any unprivileged user via `machinectl`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** Unprivileged users can access sensitive information about all running containers, regardless of ownership, using the `machinectl` command. This includes:
    *   Internal IP address of the container
    *   OS version running inside the container
    *   List of running processes
    *   File path to the container's root filesystem

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain detailed insights into the internal workings of all containers running on the host, potentially aiding further attacks.
*   **Reduced Security:** Exposing container internals violates the principle of least privilege, potentially increasing the attack surface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the host where the vulnerable containers are running.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker executes the `machinectl` command to obtain sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker only needs to be an unprivileged user on the host system.
*   **Local Access:** Physical or remote access to the host is required to execute the `machinectl` command.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The vulnerability exists within `oci-register-machine` not `systemd`.
*  A fix was implemented by introducing a configuration file `/etc/oci-register-machine.conf` that allows administrators to disable the tool.
* There was discussion on whether this was a real security issue because the read-only access to machine properties was seen as not much of a problem compared to the information available in the process tree. However, it was noted that some systems use kernel patches to restrict process tree access.
