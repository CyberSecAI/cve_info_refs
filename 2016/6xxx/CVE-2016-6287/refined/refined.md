The content is related to CVE-2016-5385 (httpoxy)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the CGI specification where HTTP headers are converted into environment variables, prefixed with "HTTP_". An attacker can send a crafted "Proxy" header which gets converted to the "HTTP_PROXY" environment variable. This environment variable is often used by HTTP client programs and libraries to determine a proxy server, leading to a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure handling of HTTP headers by CGI implementations.
- Trusting user-supplied HTTP headers to determine proxy settings.
- The "determine-proxy" default behavior of "http-client" egg ("determine-proxy-from-environment")

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can force the application to route HTTP requests through a proxy server controlled by the attacker, enabling them to intercept and modify the application's traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted "Proxy" header in an HTTP request.
- This is particularly impactful when the server-side application is a CGI program.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server which uses CGI.
- The attacker needs to be positioned to act as a man-in-the-middle.

**Additional details:**
- The "spiffy-cgi-handlers" egg is vulnerable due to its default setup that converts HTTP headers to environment variables.
- The "http-client" egg is vulnerable with its default `determine-proxy` configuration, especially when used within a CGI environment.
- The provided text describes workarounds for the vulnerability:
    - In `spiffy-cgi-handlers`, you can add `("HTTP_PROXY" . #f)` to the `cgi-default-environment` to prevent the setting of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable based on the HTTP `Proxy` header.
    - In `http-client`, you can override the `determine-proxy` parameter with a custom procedure (e.g., `(determine-proxy (constantly #f))`) to disable proxy determination from the environment.
- The fix involves updating to `http-client 0.10` and `spiffy-cgi-handlers 0.5`.
