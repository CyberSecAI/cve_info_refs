Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `X509_Certificate::allowed_usage` function in the Botan library. This function is intended to check if a certificate's key usage flags are valid according to a given set of required usages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Logic:** The function used an OR logic instead of an AND logic when checking for multiple required key usages. This means that if a certificate had *any* of the required key usages set, the function would incorrectly return true, instead of requiring *all* of them to be set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass of Key Usage Checks:** An attacker could potentially bypass application key usage checks, by using a certificate that lacks some required usages. This could lead to the misuse of the certificate in scenarios that were not intended by the issuing authority. For example, a certificate not authorized for signing could be incorrectly accepted for this purpose.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited by presenting a malformed X.509 certificate to an application using the vulnerable `allowed_usage` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to present a certificate to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker would likely need to control the certificate or at least be able to craft certificates with specific key usage extensions.
- The attacker would need some understanding of the application's expected key usage.
