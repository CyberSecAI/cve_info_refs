Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6859

**Product:** SAP Hybris

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improperly handled errors within the Hybris Management Console (HMC). When authenticated users trigger unexpected errors, the application fails to catch these errors correctly, resulting in the exposure of full Java stack traces to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure through exposed Java stack traces. These traces contain sensitive implementation details, including code paths and internal workings of the application.
- **Improper Error Handling:** The application lacks proper error handling mechanisms, specifically failing to catch unexpected errors and preventing them from propagating to the user interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Leakage of Implementation Details:** Malicious users can obtain internal implementation details of the HMC application.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** This information could be leveraged to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks or identify other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Hybris Management Console (HMC).
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of HMC to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the SAP Hybris environment, specifically within the Hybris Management Console (HMC).
- The attacker must have the ability to interact with the application in a way that triggers unexpected errors.
