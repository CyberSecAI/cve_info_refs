Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect creation of directories under `opt/mqm/mqexplorer/eclipse` during the installation of IBM MQ on Linux x86-64 systems. These directories are created with owner "555" (a non-existent user) and group "mqm".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Permissions:** The primary vulnerability lies in the assignment of ownership of critical directories to a non-existent user. This allows a local user to modify these directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Product Unusability:** A local user can alter the contents of the `opt/mqm/mqexplorer/eclipse` directory, rendering the IBM MQ product unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have local access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be a local user on the system where IBM MQ is installed.
*   The attacker does not need any elevated privileges other than the ability to modify files in the vulnerable directory.

**Summary of the vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a mistake in setting the file system ownership when the IBM MQ Explorer is installed, which causes it to be vulnerable to local access attacks that can lead to product unusability.
