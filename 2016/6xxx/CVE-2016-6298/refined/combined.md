## Description

[![@simo5](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8332609?u=2f7f5a6d40f5137811aa8aa9b5e9e8a7ecc7d17f&v=4&size=48)](/simo5)[simo5](https://github.com/simo5)opened [on Aug 31, 2016](https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto/issues/65#issue-174170727)

The jwcrypto implementation of the RSA1\_5 algorithm is vulnerable to the Million Message Attack described in [RFC 3128](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3218.txt).

A timing attack can be leveraged against the implementation to detect when a chosed ciphertext generates a valid header and padding because invalid headr/padding generates a code exception and cryptographic operations are terminated earlier resulting in measurably faster processing over the network.

Many thanks to Dennis Detering dennis.detering@rub.de for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.

time.clock() is the worst clock on Unix. You want:

* time.perf\_counter() on Python 3.3+
* time.time() on POSIX
* time.clock() on Windows

This is just a tool to get a rough idea of the timing, the variation is still high enough to not really matter I think.

| I'm not fully convinced that the mitigation removes all timing variations. It's almost impossible to write constant timing code in Python. Heck, it's even extremely hard in C.  How about we mark PKCS1v15, NULL and other bad algos as insecure and not offer them by default? I have an idea to make the registry more flexible. |

| We can't remove all timing variations but that is not the point, we just need to avoid big enough variations to be measurable over the network. Different messages already cause different timings on their own. It makes no sense to remove RSA1\_5 because we have a mitigation and the vulnerability is usage specific, it is only present if an attacker can capture messages and use a server as an oracle. There are perfectly valid uses of this algorithm and it is mandated by the standard, |

| This patch looks pretty good to me. It's a great idea to always throw an exception: My test cases showed great results with this fix and I believe the difference in timing is negligible over the network.  I agree, that RSA 1.5 is not the best algorithm to support, but as Simo already mentioned, it's necessary to support it in order to be compliant with the specification. I guess, there are some discussions about deprecating this algorithm though...  Thanks for your fast reaction in fixing this, Simo! It was a pleasure! |

| [@simo5](https://github.com/simo5) I'm working on backporting the fix to Ubuntu 16.04 (0.2.1). Could you possibly share your tests for the issue so I can write a unit test and confirm the backported fix works?  <https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2016/CVE-2016-6298.html> |

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

[CVE-2016-6298](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wg33-x934-3ghh "CVE-2016-6298"): Million Messages Attack mitigation

```
RFC 3218 describes an oracle attack called Million Messages Attack
against RSA with PKCS1 v1.5 padding.

Depending on how JWEs are used a server may become an Oracle, and the
mitigation presecribed in RFC 3218 2.3.2 need to be implemented.

Many thanks to Dennis Detering for his responsible disclosure and help
verifying the mitigation approach.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

[v0.3.2](/latchset/jwcrypto/tree/v0.3.2)

[`b81d7ea`](/latchset/jwcrypto/commit/b81d7ea6459b2ec42da519ba19f983e2f4416fbb)

The jwcrypto implementation of the RSA1\_5 algorithm was found vulnerable to the Million Message Attack described in RFC 3128.

A timing attack could be leveraged against the implementation to detect when a chosen ciphertext generates a valid header and padding because invalid header/padding generates a code exception and cryptographic operations are terminated earlier resulting in faster processing measurable over the network.

Many thanks to Dennis Detering dennis.detering@rub.de for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.
