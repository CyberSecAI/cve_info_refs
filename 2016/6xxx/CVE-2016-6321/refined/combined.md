Package        : tar
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-6321
Debian Bug     : 842339

Harry Sintonen discovered that GNU tar does not properly handle member
names containing '..', thus allowing an attacker to bypass the path
names specified on the command line and replace files and directories in
the target directory.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.27.1-2+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.29b-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tar packages.

Vulnerability: POINTYFEATHER aka Tar extract pathname bypass
Credits: Harry Sintonen / FSC1V Cyber Security Services
Date: 2016-10-27
Impact: File overwrite in certain situations
Classifier: Full spectrum cyber
CVSS: 4.3.2
Threat level: Manatee
//NORDIC EYES ONLY//NOFORN//PUBLIC//EXPLOIT GLOBAL//
In a time when 0days are hoarded and exchanged for
local currencies in different parts of the world,
F-Secure CSS is going old-school and dropping a
not-so-valuable vulnerability, for free as in beer.
Tar will happily extract files & directories into
an arbitrary location when supplied with a suitably
crafted archive file. If a target system is extracting
an attacker supplied file, the vulnerability can
be exploited to gain file overwrite capability.
We have exploited this vulnerability in environments
where tar was run as root to gain root access on the
target. In most scenarios this is a non-issue, however
as we have witnessed, corner cases can be quite
useful.
After the communication with different parties was
discontinued for more than 42 days, the decision was
made to proceed with our honorable disclosure policy.
Greets to our Swedish friends olleb, Linus, Daniel W,
Ludde - see you at t2!

CVE-2016-6321 - GNU tar extract pathname bypass
===============================================
The latest version of this advisory is available at:
https://sintonen.fi/advisories/tar-extract-pathname-bypass.proper.txt
Overview
--------
GNU `tar' archiver can be tricked into extracting files and
directories in the given destination, regardless of the path
name(s) specified on the command line.
Description
-----------
GNU `tar' archiver attempts to avoid path traversal attacks
by removing offending parts of the element name at extract.
This sanitizing leads to a vulnerability where the attacker
can bypass the path name(s) specified on the command line.
Impact
------
The attacker can create a crafted tar archive that, if
extracted by the victim, replaces files and directories
the victim has access to in the target directory, regardless
of the path name(s) specified on the command line.
Details
-------
The discovered vulnerability, described in more detail below,
enables file and directory overwrite attacks against the user
or system by using a crafted tar archive. The attack requires
that the victim or system extract the crafted tar archive prepared
by the attacker. Automated systems extracting paths from archives
originating from untrusted sources are in particular danger,
especially if the extract operation is performed with elevated
privileges.
In the worst-case scenario this vulnerability can lead to a full
system compromise (remote code execution as root).
1. Extract pathname bypass due to safer\_name\_suffix usage
lib/paxnames.c safer\_name\_suffix() function sanitizes the `file\_name'
parameter and removes the file system prefix from the name if
`absolute\_names' parameter is 0. As a result, the path name
effectively becomes relative to the target directory, ignoring the
path name given on the command line.
The history of this bug is somewhat complicated:
- Before 13.12.1999 commit it was possible to extract entries
with member names containing ".." sequence(s).
- On 13.12.1999 commit the code was changed[1] to warn about
and skip member names that had ".." sequence(s):
`(extract\_archive): By default, warn about ".." in member
names, and skip them.'
- However on 05.07.2003 the code was changed[2] to use
`safer\_name\_suffix' function:
`(extract\_archive): Use safer\_name\_suffix rather than rolling
our own.'
The unfortunate side effect of the 05.07.2003 change was that
rather than skipping the entries with malicious member names with
".." in them, the code would now attempt to make the malicious name
safe. Making the name safe involves stripping all offending path
components, thus resulting the target name being relative to the
target directory root, regardless of the requested path name.
Here is a number of practical attack scenarios:
- Attack the user by replacing important files, such as
.ssh/authorized\_keys, .bashrc, .bash\_logout, .profile,
.subversion or .anyconnect, when they extract an tar archive.
For example:
user@host:~$ dpkg --fsys-tarfile evil.deb | tar -xf - \
--wildcards 'blurf\*'
tar: Removing leading `blurf/../' from member names
user@host:~$ cat .ssh/authorized\_keys
ssh-rsa AAAAB3...nU= mrrobot@fsociety
user@host:~$
- Attack automation that extracts tar originating from a web
application or similar sources. Such operation might be performed by
a setuid root component of the application. The command executed
could be for example:
#tar -C / -zxf /tmp/tmp.tgz etc/application var/chroot/application/etc
The attacker can overwrite /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root to gain code
execution as root. It is also possible to replace binaries commonly
executed by root with a backdoored ones, or to drop setuid root
binaries that will enable the attacker to gain root privileges at
will. Common attack would be to replace some network facing daemon
with backdoored one, enabling covert code execution on demand.
This type of scenario has been successfully exploited in the real
world to gain a remote code execution as root in different
environments.
- Attack commands that try to replace single files/dirs as root:
The victim would like to replace `/etc/motd' file in the system by
extracting it from an archive obtained from an untrusted source:
# tar -C / -xvf archive.tar etc/motd
tar: Removing leading `etc/motd/../' from member names
etc/motd/../etc/shadow
#
The attacker can also bypass --exclude rule, if it is being used
with --anchored switch. For example: The victim would like to extract
all files but `/etc/shadow' from an archive:
# tar -C / -xvf archive.tar --anchored --exclude etc/shadow
tar: Removing leading `etc/motd/../' from member names
etc/motd/../etc/shadow
#
In both cases, the attacker has now successfully replaced /etc/shadow
file with arbitrary content.
Exploiting the vulnerability works best if the attacker has some prior
knowledge of the specifics of the tar command line that gets executed.
The path prefix before the `..' sequence will need to (at least
partially) match the target path (or not match in case of the exclude
rule) in order for the bypass attack to work. Guessing which paths
the victim might extract could work too, but the success rate is
likely lower.
Vulnerable versions
-------------------
- GNU tar 1.14 to 1.29 (inclusive)
Affected operating systems
--------------------------
Red Hat
Alpine Linux
Red Star OS
...
any other Linux using GNU tar
Recommended changes to GNU tar
------------------------------
1. Skip entries with member names containing a '..', or fail the whole
tar extract operation.
The following patch by GNU tar project implements the fix:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=7340f67b9860ea0531c1450e5aa261c50f67165d
Alternatively the following patch by the advisory author could be used:
https://sintonen.fi/advisories/tar-extract-pathname-bypass.patch
End user mitigation
-------------------
1. If your OS distribution offers a fixed GNU tar version, install it
or
2. Only extract untrusted tar archives to a temporary directory in
virtual machine
or
3. Prohibit full spectrum cyber operations in your enterprise.
Proof-of-concept

# [CSS] POINTYFEATHER / tar extract pathname bypass (CVE-2016-6321) - patch update

---

*From*: Harry Sintonen <fulldisclosure () kyber fi>

*Date*: Sun, 30 Oct 2016 03:03:07 +0200 (EET)

---

```

Update on the advisory: As pointed out by several people, the ERROR
macro did't fail the operation in a desired way: Files were still
being created by tar. In order to really stop tar from doing silly
things, FATAL_ERROR macro needs to be used instead.

The patch has now been updated accordingly.

```
Updated Advisory:
<https://sintonen.fi/advisories/tar-extract-pathname-bypass.proper.txt>
```

Updated Patch:
<https://sintonen.fi/advisories/tar-extract-pathname-bypass.patch>

NOTE: Ideas on how to make tar safely skip such entries instead of
failing the whole operating are welcome.

# Tar: Extract pathname bypass — GLSA **201611-19**

A path traversal attack in Tar may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/tar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.29-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.29-r1** |

### Background

The Tar program provides the ability to create and manipulate tar
archives.

### Description

Tar attempts to avoid path traversal attacks by removing offending parts
of the element name at extract. This sanitizing leads to a vulnerability
where the attacker can bypass the path name(s) specified on the command
line.

### Impact

The attacker can create a crafted tar archive that, if extracted by the
victim, replaces files and directories the victim has access to in the
target directory, regardless of the path name(s) specified on the command
line.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Tar users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/tar-1.29-r1"

```

Thanks for the heads-up. Yes, it appears the 2003 change was not sufficiently
paranoid about ".." in member names. Luckily, the tar manual still documents the
pre-2003 behavior, so we can restore that behavior as a simple bug fix. I
installed the attached patch into Savannah as one way to do that. This patch
causes 'tar' to issue two diagnostics when given a member name containing "..",
and I suppose tar should be cleaned up at some point to issue just one
diagnostic. The main thing, though, is that the patch is simple and fixes the
security gotcha in question.
```

```
I don't view this as a serious bug, as the tar manual has long said that you
should extract untrusted tarballs only into empty directories, and doing that
forestalls the attack even without this patch. (There are other reasons for this
longstanding recommendation.)

# USN-3132-1: tar vulnerability

21 November 2016

tar could be made to overwrite files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.10](/security/notices?release=yakkety)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [tar](/security/cves?package=tar) - GNU version of the tar archiving utility

## Details

Harry Sintonen discovered that tar incorrectly handled extracting files

when path names are specified on the command line. If a user or automated

system were tricked into processing a specially crafted archive, an

attacker could possibly overwrite arbitrary files.

## Binary packages built by this source

[tar](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/tar):
GNU version of the tar archiving utility

Tar is a program for packaging a set of files as a single archive in tar

 format. The function it performs is conceptually similar to cpio, and to

 things like PKZIP in the DOS world. It is heavily used by the Debian package

 management system, and is useful for performing system backups and exchanging

 sets of files with others.

        Vulnerability: POINTYFEATHER aka Tar extract pathname bypass
        Credits: Harry Sintonen / FSC1V Cyber Security Services
        Date: 2016-10-27
        Impact: File overwrite in certain situations
        Classifier: Full spectrum cyber
        CVSS: 4.3.2
        Threat level: Manatee

        //NORDIC EYES ONLY//NOFORN//PUBLIC//EXPLOIT GLOBAL//

        In a time when 0days are hoarded and exchanged for
        local currencies in different parts of the world,
        F-Secure CSS is going old-school and dropping a
        not-so-valuable vulnerability, for free as in beer.

        Tar will happily extract files & directories into
        an arbitrary location when supplied with a suitably
        crafted archive file. If a target system is extracting
        an attacker supplied file, the vulnerability can
        be exploited to gain file overwrite capability.

        We have exploited this vulnerability in environments
        where tar was run as root to gain root access on the
        target. In most scenarios this is a non-issue, however
        as we have witnessed, corner cases can be quite
        useful.

        After the communication with different parties was
        discontinued for more than 42 days, the decision was
        made to proceed with our honorable disclosure policy.

        Greets to our Swedish friends olleb, Linus, Daniel W,
        Ludde - see you at t2!

CVE-2016-6321 - GNU tar extract pathname bypass
===============================================
The latest version of this advisory is available at:
<https://sintonen.fi/advisories/tar-extract-pathname-bypass.proper.txt>

Overview
--------

```
GNU `tar' archiver can be tricked into extracting files and
directories in the given destination, regardless of the path
name(s) specified on the command line.
```

Description
-----------

```
GNU `tar' archiver attempts to avoid path traversal attacks
by removing offending parts of the element name at extract.
This sanitizing leads to a vulnerability where the attacker
can bypass the path name(s) specified on the command line.
```

Impact
------

```
The attacker can create a crafted tar archive that, if
extracted by the victim, replaces files and directories
the victim has access to in the target directory, regardless
of the path name(s) specified on the command line.
```

Details
-------

```
The discovered vulnerability, described in more detail below,
enables file and directory overwrite attacks against the user
or system by using a crafted tar archive. The attack requires
that the victim or system extract the crafted tar archive prepared
by the attacker. Automated systems extracting paths from archives
originating from untrusted sources are in particular danger,
especially if the extract operation is performed with elevated
privileges.
```

```
In the worst-case scenario this vulnerability can lead to a full
system compromise (remote code execution as root).
```

1. Extract pathname bypass due to safer_name_suffix usage

```
lib/paxnames.c safer\_name\_suffix() function sanitizes the `file\_name'
parameter and removes the file system prefix from the name if
`absolute\_names' parameter is 0. As a result, the path name
effectively becomes relative to the target directory, ignoring the
path name given on the command line.
```

The history of this bug is somewhat complicated:

- Before 13.12.1999 commit it was possible to extract entries
  with member names containing ".." sequence(s).
- On 13.12.1999 commit the code was changed[1] to warn about
  and skip member names that had ".." sequence(s):
  `(extract_archive): By default, warn about ".." in member
  names, and skip them.'
- However on 05.07.2003 the code was changed[2] to use
  `safer_name_suffix' function:
  `(extract_archive): Use safer_name_suffix rather than rolling
   our own.'

```
The unfortunate side effect of the 05.07.2003 change was that
rather than skipping the entries with malicious member names with
".." in them, the code would now attempt to make the malicious name
safe. Making the name safe involves stripping all offending path
components, thus resulting the target name being relative to the
target directory root, regardless of the requested path name.
```

Here is a number of practical attack scenarios:

- Attack the user by replacing important files, such as
  .ssh/authorized_keys, .bashrc, .bash_logout, .profile,
  .subversion or .anyconnect, when they extract an tar archive.
   For example:

  user@host:~$ dpkg --fsys-tarfile evil.deb | tar -xf - \
  --wildcards 'blurf*'
  tar: Removing leading `blurf/../' from member names
  user@host:~$ cat .ssh/authorized_keys
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3...nU= mrrobot@fsociety
  user@host:~$

- Attack automation that extracts tar originating from a web
  application or similar sources. Such operation might be performed by
  a setuid root component of the application. The command executed
  could be for example:

  #tar -C / -zxf /tmp/tmp.tgz etc/application var/chroot/application/etc

  The attacker can overwrite /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root to gain code
  execution as root. It is also possible to replace binaries commonly
  executed by root with a backdoored ones, or to drop setuid root
  binaries that will enable the attacker to gain root privileges at
  will. Common attack would be to replace some network facing daemon
  with backdoored one, enabling covert code execution on demand.

  This type of scenario has been successfully exploited in the real
  world to gain a remote code execution as root in different
  environments.

- Attack commands that try to replace single files/dirs as root:

  The victim would like to replace `/etc/motd' file in the system by
  extracting it from an archive obtained from an untrusted source:

  # tar -C / -xvf archive.tar etc/motd
  tar: Removing leading `etc/motd/../' from member names
  etc/motd/../etc/shadow
  #

  The attacker can also bypass --exclude rule, if it is being used
  with --anchored switch. For example: The victim would like to extract
  all files but `/etc/shadow' from an archive:

  # tar -C / -xvf archive.tar --anchored --exclude etc/shadow
  tar: Removing leading `etc/motd/../' from member names
  etc/motd/../etc/shadow
  #

  In both cases, the attacker has now successfully replaced /etc/shadow
  file with arbitrary content.

```
Exploiting the vulnerability works best if the attacker has some prior
knowledge of the specifics of the tar command line that gets executed.
The path prefix before the `..' sequence will need to (at least
partially) match the target path (or not match in case of the exclude
rule) in order for the bypass attack to work. Guessing which paths
the victim might extract could work too, but the success rate is
likely lower.
```

Vulnerable versions
-------------------

- GNU tar 1.14 to 1.29 (inclusive)

Affected operating systems
--------------------------

Red Hat
Alpine Linux
Red Star OS
...
any other Linux using GNU tar

Recommended changes to GNU tar
------------------------------

1. Skip entries with member names containing a '..', or fail the whole
   tar extract operation. A proposed patch that mitigates the issue:

   <https://sintonen.fi/advisories/tar-extract-pathname-bypass.patch>

   While this patch applies to GNU paxutils, it should only be applied
   to version being used in `tar', not paxutils itself. Patching the
   paxutils itself would likely break excepted GNU `cpio'
   functionality.

End user mitigation
-------------------

1. If your OS distribution offers a fixed GNU tar version, install it

or

2. Only extract untrusted tar archives to a temporary directory in
   virtual machine

or

3. Prohibit full spectrum cyber operations in your enterprise.

Proof-of-concept
----------------

$ curl <https://sintonen.fi/advisories/tar-poc.tar> | tar xv etc/motd
$ cat etc/shadow

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
