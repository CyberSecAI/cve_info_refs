Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how GNU tar handles member names containing the ".." sequence during extraction. The `safer_name_suffix` function, intended to sanitize file names and prevent path traversal attacks, inadvertently strips away path components, effectively making the target file relative to the destination directory, ignoring any specified path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal Bypass:** By crafting a tar archive with member names containing "..", an attacker can bypass the path specified during extraction. For example, if the command is `tar -C / -xvf archive.tar etc/motd`, and the archive contains a file named `etc/motd/../etc/shadow`, the `etc/shadow` file can be overwritten.
*   **Incorrect Sanitization:** The intended sanitization process using `safer_name_suffix` removes path prefixes, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Bypass of Exclude Rules:** If the `--exclude` option is used with `--anchored`, it can also be bypassed using this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite files and directories the victim has access to, regardless of the specified path or exclusion rules.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** When the tar command is run with elevated privileges (e.g. as root), the attacker can overwrite system files, leading to code execution as root or other privilege escalation.
*   **Remote Code Execution (in worst case scenario):** By overwriting critical system files or binaries, an attacker can gain remote code execution capabilities.
*   **User Compromise**: Attackers can replace user's files such as `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` or shell config files, resulting in unauthorized access.
*   **Compromise of Automated Systems:** Automated systems that extract tar archives from untrusted sources are highly vulnerable, especially if performed with elevated privileges.
*  **Backdooring of executables**: Attackers can replace existing binaries or introduce new SUID binaries leading to privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Tar Archives:** The attack requires a specially crafted tar archive with malicious member names.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must extract the malicious archive.
*   **Automated Systems:** Automated systems that extract tar archives are particularly vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious tar archive:** The attacker needs to be able to create an archive with specific file names
*   **Knowledge of the target system or command line (preferred):** While guessing is possible, knowledge of the specific command line used for extraction increases the chances of success. Especially knowing paths targeted by the victim during extraction or exclude rules.
*   **Delivery of the archive to the victim:** The attacker needs a way to get the victim to extract the malicious archive, such as through email, web downloads, or other means.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability existed in GNU tar versions 1.14 through 1.29 (inclusive).
*   The vulnerability was discovered on March 10, 2016.
*   The fix involves skipping entries with member names containing "..".
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3702-1 provides information on the fix for Debian systems.
*   The vulnerability is referred to as "POINTYFEATHER" by the discoverer.
