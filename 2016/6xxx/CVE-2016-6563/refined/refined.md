Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6563:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `parse_xml_value` function within the HNAP (Home Network Administration Protocol) implementation of D-Link routers. This function is used to parse XML tags inside SOAP messages during the HNAP Login action. Specifically, it copies tag values into a local variable and then into a target buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `parse_xml_value` function contains two stack buffer overflows.
    - The first overflow occurs due to the use of `strncpy` where the size argument is determined by the length of the XML tag value, without checking its maximum size. This can overflow a local stack buffer within `parse_xml_value`.
    - The second overflow happens when the content of this local buffer is copied to a stack variable in the calling function `hnap_main` using `strcpy`, without any bounds checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the vulnerable device by exploiting the stack buffer overflows.
- Complete compromise of the device: Successful exploitation leads to the ability to execute arbitrary code, giving the attacker full control over the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exposed over the LAN interface on port 80, where the HNAP service is listening.
- Protocol: The attack is performed by sending a crafted SOAP message to the HNAP service with oversized values for the following XML parameters `Action`, `Username`, `LoginPassword`, or `Captcha`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must be on the same local network (LAN) as the vulnerable router to exploit the vulnerability.
- No authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Devices:** The vulnerability affects multiple D-Link DIR series routers across both MIPS and ARM architectures, including but not limited to:
    - MIPS: DIR-823, DIR-822, DIR-818L(W)
    - ARM: DIR-895L, DIR-890L, DIR-885L, DIR-880L, DIR-868L (Rev. B and C only).

- **Exploitation Details:**
   - The vulnerability is present in the processing of XML tags when performing the HNAP Login action.
    - The overflow can be triggered by sending oversized data in the 'Action', 'Username', 'LoginPassword' or 'Captcha' fields.
    -  For MIPS devices, the exploitation involves ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) using gadgets from `libuClibc-0.9.30.3.so` to prepare the stack for shellcode execution and to flush the CPU cache before the exploit.
     - For ARM devices, the exploitation is more straightforward, involving return-to-libc using gadgets from `libuClibc-0.9.32.1.so` to execute the `system()` function with a command located on the stack.
 - The ARM devices have non-executable stack (NX) and a weak 32-bit ASLR, which makes exploitation possible with multiple attempts.
 - The MIPS devices do not have NX or ASLR.
- **Exploit Availability:** A Metasploit module is available for exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Vendor Response:** D-Link did not respond to CERT's or the researcher's requests for information, and no official firmware fix was available when the vulnerability was reported.  D-Link released firmware updates later as per the CERT advisory update.
