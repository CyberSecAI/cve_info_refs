{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Android code responsible for handling Proxy Auto Config (PAC) files does not validate the size of the downloaded PAC file before loading it into memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation on the size of the PAC file.",
      "Unbounded memory allocation when reading the PAC file."
    ],
    "impact": "A large, specially crafted PAC file can cause the device to exhaust all available memory, leading to a system halt and soft reboot.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, where an attacker intercepts and replaces a legitimate PAC file with a malicious, oversized one.",
      "Directly configuring a malicious PAC URL in the Android network settings."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "For MITM attack: ability to intercept network traffic and modify responses.",
      "For direct configuration: physical access to the device or remote access to network settings."
    ],
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability resides in PacManager.java, where the Streams.readFully method is used to read the entire PAC file into memory without checking its size."
