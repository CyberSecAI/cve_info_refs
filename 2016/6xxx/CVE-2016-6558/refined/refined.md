{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `action_script` parameter in `apply.cgi` on the RP-AC52 web interface does not properly validate user-supplied input before executing it as a command.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-77)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted request to the `apply.cgi` page with a malicious `action_script` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface. No authentication is required for this vulnerability, however an authenticated session is required to reach the affected endpoint. An unauthenticated user might leverage another vulnerability (CSRF) to achieve this. "
