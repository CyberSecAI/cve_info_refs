- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A memory leak occurs due to inadequate input validation when handling specific malformed packets. The device fails to release the buffer containing malicious packet fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation leading to a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can send numerous malformed packets to exhaust the device's memory, leading to a device restart (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** Network access is required, and the SEP protocol must be in use. The attacker sends malformed packets to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device and be able to send crafted packets using the SEP protocol.
