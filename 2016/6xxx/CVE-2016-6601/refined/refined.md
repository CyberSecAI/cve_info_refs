Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6601:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `FetchFile` servlet in WebNMS Framework Server is vulnerable to directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The `fileName` parameter in the `FetchFile` servlet is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to use `../` sequences to navigate to arbitrary directories on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Download:** An unauthenticated attacker can download arbitrary text files from the server. While binary files will be mangled during the download process, sensitive configuration files, password files, source code, and other text-based information could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attack can be carried out without needing to authenticate to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WebNMS Framework Server instance. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed.
-  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `fileName` in the GET request to the `FetchFile` servlet.
- The following request demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited:
  ```
  GET /servlets/FetchFile?fileName=../../../etc/shadow HTTP/1.1
  ```
- This request will attempt to download the `/etc/shadow` file, which contains user password hashes (on Unix-like systems).
- The vulnerability is known to affect WebNMS Framework Server versions 5.2 and 5.2 SP1.
