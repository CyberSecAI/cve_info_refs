```
>> Multiple vulnerabilities in WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 and 5.2 SP1
>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
==========================================================================
Disclosure: 04/07/2016 / Last updated: 08/08/2016

>> Background on the affected product:
"WebNMS is an industry-leading framework for building network management applications. With over 25,000 deployments worldwide and in every Tier 1 Carrier, network equipment providers and service providers can customize, extend and rebrand WebNMS as a comprehensive Element Management System (EMS) or Network Management System (NMS).
NOC Operators, Architects and Developers can customize the functional modules to fit their domain and network. Functional modules include Fault Correlation, Performance KPIs, Device Configuration, Service Provisioning and Security. WebNMS supports numerous Operating Systems, Application Servers, and databases."

>> Summary:
WebNMS contains three critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker: one directory traversal that can be used to achieve remote code execution, another directory traversal that can be abused to download any text file in the system and the possibility to impersonate any user in the system. In addition, WebNMS also stores the user passwords in a file with a weak obfuscation algorithm that can be easily reversed.

A special thanks to the SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure programme (SSD), which performed the disclosure in a responsible manner to the affected vendor. This advisory can be seen in their blog at https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2712

Metasploit exploits for all vulnerabilities have also been released.

>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Directory traversal in file upload functionality (leading to remote code execution)
CVE-2016-6600
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

The FileUploadServlet has a directory traversal vulnerability, that allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload a JSP file that executes on the server.
To exploit this vulnerability, simply POST as per the proof of concept below. The directory traversal is in the "fileName" parameter.

POST /servlets/FileUploadServlet?fileName=../jsp/Login.jsp HTTP/1.1
<JSP payload here>

There are two things to keep in mind for the upload to be successful:
- Only text files can be uploaded, binary files will be mangled.
- In order to achieve code execution without authentication, the files need to be dropped in ../jsp/ but they can only have the following names: either Login.jsp or a WebStartXXX.jsp, where XXX is any string of any length.

#2
Vulnerability: Directory traversal in file download functionality
CVE-2016-6601
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. Only text files can be downloaded properly, any binary file will get mangled by the servlet and downloaded incorrectly.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

The FetchFile servlet has a directory traversal vulnerability that can be abused by an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files from the WebNMS host. The vulnerable parameter is "fileName" and a proof of concept is shown below.

GET /servlets/FetchFile?fileName=../../../etc/shadow

#3
Vulnerability: Weak obfuscation algorithm used to store passwords
CVE-2016-6602
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

The ./conf/securitydbData.xml file (in the WebNMS WEB-INF directory) contains entries with all the usernames and passwords in the server:
<DATA ownername="NULL" password="e8c89O1f" username="guest"/>
<DATA ownername="NULL" password="d7963B4t" username="root"/>

The algorithm used to obfuscate is convoluted but easy to reverse engineer. The passwords above are "guest" for the "guest" user and "admin" for the "root" user. A Metasploit module implementing the deobfuscation algorithm has been released.

This vulnerability can be combined with #2 and allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain credentials for all user accounts:
GET /servlets/FetchFile?fileName=conf/securitydbData.xml

#4
Vulnerability: User account impersonation / hijacking
CVE-2016-6603
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

It is possible to impersonate any user in WebNMS by simply setting the "UserName" HTTP header when making a request, which will return a valid authenticated session cookie. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to impersonate the superuser ("root") and perform administrative actions. The proof of concept is shown below:

GET /servlets/GetChallengeServlet HTTP/1.1
UserName: root

This returns the cookie "SessionId=0033C8CFFE37EB6093849CBA4BF2CAF3;" which is a valid, JSESSIONID cookie authenticated as the "root" user. This can then be used to login to the WebNMS Framework Server by simply setting the cookie and browsing to any page.

>> Fix:
Since the vendor did not respond to any contacts attempted by Beyond Security and its SSD programme, it is not known whether a fixed version of WebNMS Framework Server has been released. It is highly recommended not to expose the server to any untrusted networks (such as the Internet).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

See below for other constraints.Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1
The FileUploadServlet has a directory traversal vulnerability, that allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload a JSP file that executes on the server. To exploit this vulnerability, simply POST as per the proof of concept below. The directory traversal is in the "fileName" parameter.
POST /servlets/FileUploadServlet?fileName=../jsp/Login.jsp HTTP/1.1<JSP payload here>
There are two things to keep in mind for the upload to be successful:- Only text files can be uploaded, binary files will be mangled.- In order to achieve code execution without authentication, the files need to be dropped in ../jsp/ but they can only have the following names: either Login.jsp or a WebStartXXX.jsp, where XXX is any string of any length.
#2Vulnerability: Directory traversal in file download functionalityCVE-2016-6601Attack Vector: RemoteConstraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. Only text files can be downloaded properly, any binary file will get mangled by the servlet and downloaded incorrectly.Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1
The FetchFile servlet has a directory traversal vulnerability that can be abused by an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files from the WebNMS host. The vulnerable parameter is "fileName" and a proof of concept is shown below.
GET /servlets/FetchFile?fileName=../../../etc/shadow
#3Vulnerability: Weak obfuscation algorithm used to store passwordsCVE-2016-6602Attack Vector: RemoteConstraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1
The ./conf/securitydbData.xml file (in the WebNMS WEB-INF directory) contains entries with all the usernames and passwords in the server:<DATA ownername="NULL" password="e8c89O1f" username="guest"/><DATA ownername="NULL" password="d7963B4t" username="root"/>
The algorithm used to obfuscate is convoluted but easy to reverse engineer. The passwords above are "guest" for the "guest" user and "admin" for the "root" user. A Metasploit module implementing the deobfuscation algorithm has been released.
This vulnerability can be combined with #2 and allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain credentials for all user accounts:GET /servlets/FetchFile?fileName=conf/securitydbData.xml
#4Vulnerability: User account impersonation / hijackingCVE-2016-6603Attack Vector: RemoteConstraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1
It is possible to impersonate any user in WebNMS by simply setting the "UserName" HTTP header when making a request, which will return a valid authenticated session cookie. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to impersonate the superuser ("root") and perform administrative actions. The proof of concept is shown below:
GET /servlets/GetChallengeServlet HTTP/1.1UserName: root
This returns the cookie "SessionId=0033C8CFFE37EB6093849CBA4BF2CAF3;" which is a valid, JSESSIONID cookie authenticated as the "root" user. This can then be used to login to the WebNMS Framework Server by simply setting the cookie and browsing to any page.
>> Fix:Since the vendor did not respond to any contacts attempted by Beyond Security and its SSD programme, it is not known whether a fixed version of WebNMS Framework Server has been released. It is highly recommended not to expose the server to any untrusted networks (such as the Internet).

```
tl;dr

RCE, file download, weak encryption and user impersonation, all of which
can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in WebNMS Framework 5.2
and 5.2 SP1.

A special thanks to Beyond Security and their SSD program, which helped
disclose the vulnerabilities. See their advisory at
<https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2712>

My full advisory can be seen below, and a copy can be obtained at the
github repo

#1
Vulnerability: Directory traversal in file upload functionality (leading
to remote code execution)
CVE-2016-6600
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. See below
for other constraints.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

The FileUploadServlet has a directory traversal vulnerability, that
allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload a JSP file that executes on
the server.
To exploit this vulnerability, simply POST as per the proof of concept
below. The directory traversal is in the "fileName" parameter.

POST /servlets/FileUploadServlet?fileName=../jsp/Login.jsp HTTP/1.1
<JSP payload here>

There are two things to keep in mind for the upload to be successful:
- Only text files can be uploaded, binary files will be mangled.
- In order to achieve code execution without authentication, the files
need to be dropped in ../jsp/ but they can only have the following
names: either Login.jsp or a WebStartXXX.jsp, where XXX is any string of
any length.

#2
Vulnerability: Directory traversal in file download functionality
CVE-2016-6601
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. Only text
files can be downloaded properly, any binary file will get mangled by
the servlet and downloaded incorrectly.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

The FetchFile servlet has a directory traversal vulnerability that can
be abused by an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files
from the WebNMS host. The vulnerable parameter is "fileName" and a proof
of concept is shown below.

GET /servlets/FetchFile?fileName=../../../etc/shadow

#3
Vulnerability: Weak obfuscation algorithm used to store passwords
CVE-2016-6602
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

The ./conf/securitydbData.xml file (in the WebNMS WEB-INF directory)
contains entries with all the usernames and passwords in the server:
<DATA ownername="NULL" password="e8c89O1f" username="guest"/>
<DATA ownername="NULL" password="d7963B4t" username="root"/>

The algorithm used to obfuscate is convoluted but easy to reverse
engineer. The passwords above are "guest" for the "guest" user and
"admin" for the "root" user. A Metasploit module implementing the
deobfuscation algorithm has been released.

This vulnerability can be combined with #2 and allow an unauthenticated
attacker to obtain credentials for all user accounts:
GET /servlets/FetchFile?fileName=conf/securitydbData.xml

#4
Vulnerability: User account impersonation / hijacking
CVE-2016-6603
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
Affected versions: unknown, at least 5.2 and 5.2 SP1

It is possible to impersonate any user in WebNMS by simply setting the
"UserName" HTTP header when making a request, which will return a valid
authenticated session cookie. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to
impersonate the superuser ("root") and perform administrative actions.
The proof of concept is shown below:

GET /servlets/GetChallengeServlet HTTP/1.1
UserName: root

This returns the cookie "SessionId=0033C8CFFE37EB6093849CBA4BF2CAF3;"
which is a valid, JSESSIONID cookie authenticated as the "root" user.
This can then be used to login to the WebNMS Framework Server by simply
setting the cookie and browsing to any page.

```
> > ```
> > Fix:
> >
> > ```

```
Since the vendor did not respond to any contacts attempted by Beyond
Security and its SSD programme, it is not known whether a fixed version
of WebNMS Framework Server has been released. It is highly recommended
not to expose the server to any untrusted networks (such as the Internet).

# WebNMS Framework Server Arbitrary Text File Download

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### WebNMS Framework Server Arbitrary Text File Download

Disclosed
07/04/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module abuses a vulnerability in WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 that allows an
unauthenticated user to download files off the file system by using a directory
traversal attack on the FetchFile servlet.
Note that only text files can be downloaded properly, as any binary file will get
mangled by the servlet. Also note that for Windows targets you can only download
files that are in the same drive as the WebNMS installation.
This module has been tested with WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 and 5.2 SP1 on
Windows and Linux.

#### Author(s)

* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/auxiliary/admin/http/webnms_file_download.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use auxiliary/admin/http/webnms_file_download
msf auxiliary(webnms_file_download) > show actions
    ...actions...
msf auxiliary(webnms_file_download) > set ACTION < action-name >

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

### WebNMS Framework Server Credential Disclosure

Disclosed
07/04/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module abuses two vulnerabilities in WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 to extract
all user credentials. The first vulnerability is an unauthenticated file download
in the FetchFile servlet, which is used to download the file containing the user
credentials. The second vulnerability is that the passwords in the file are
obfuscated with a very weak algorithm which can be easily reversed.
This module has been tested with WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 and 5.2 SP1 on
Windows and Linux.

#### Author(s)

* Pedro Ribeiro <pedrib@gmail.com>

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/auxiliary/admin/http/webnms_cred_disclosure.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/auxiliary/admin/http/webnms_cred_disclosure.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use auxiliary/admin/http/webnms_cred_disclosure
msf auxiliary(webnms_cred_disclosure) > show actions
    ...actions...
msf auxiliary(webnms_cred_disclosure) > set ACTION < action-name >
msf auxiliary(webnms_cred_disclosure) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf auxiliary(webnms_cred_disclosure) > run
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.
