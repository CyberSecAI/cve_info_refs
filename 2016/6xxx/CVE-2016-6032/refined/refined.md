- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing users to embed malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the web UI. This could lead to alteration of the intended functionality and potentially disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting JavaScript code through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with the ability to input data into the vulnerable web interface is required. The user also needs to trick another user into interacting with the malicious code, typically by getting them to load the modified page.
