Use CVE-2016-6185 for the XSLoader vulnerability.

There is not currently a separate CVE for List::MoreUtils. As far as
we can tell, the "Sun Jul 03 14:20:04 2016" section of 115808 gives
possible reasons for List::MoreUtils to be fixed independently, but
doesn't directly argue that List::MoreUtils was responsible for a
vulnerability on its own. Actually, it might imply the opposite, with
the "Even if List::MoreUtils is not at fault, I think this patch is
helpful" wording.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2016-485dff6060
2016-07-18 15:53:35.904688
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : perl
Product : Fedora 24
Version : 5.22.2
Release : 361.fc24
URL : <http://www.perl.org/>
Summary : Practical Extraction and Report Language
Description :
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.

Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your system to
handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter.

If your script requires some Perl modules, you can install them with
"perl(MODULE)" where "MODULE" is a name of required module. E.g. install
"perl(Test::More)" to make Test::More Perl module available.

If you need all the Perl modules that come with upstream Perl sources, so
called core modules, install perl-core package.

If you only need perl run-time as a shared library, i.e. Perl interpreter
embedded into another application, the only essential package is perl-libs.

Perl header files can be found in perl-devel package.

Perl utils like "splain" or "perlbug" can be found in perl-utils package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This fixes CVE-2016-6185 vulnerability (do not let XSLoader load relative
paths).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
References:

[ 1 ] Bug #1354386 - CVE-2016-6185 perl: XSLoader loads relative paths not included in @INC
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1354386>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update can be installed with the "yum" update program. Use
su -c 'yum update perl' at the command line.
For more information, refer to "Managing Software with yum",
available at <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/>.

All packages are signed with the Fedora Project GPG key. More details on the
GPG keys used by the Fedora Project can be found at
<https://fedoraproject.org/keys>

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017
* 18 July 2017

## Binary packages built by this source

[libcgi-fast-perl](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/libcgi-fast-perl):
CGI::Fast Perl module

CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm. It is

 specialized to work well with the Open Market FastCGI standard, which

 greatly speeds up CGI scripts by turning them into persistently running

 server processes. Scripts that perform time-consuming initialization

 processes, such as loading large modules or opening persistent database

 connections, will see large performance improvements.

[libperl-dev](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/libperl-dev):
Perl library: development files

Files for developing applications which embed a Perl interpreter.

[libperl5.18](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/libperl5.18):
shared Perl library

This package is required by programs which embed a Perl interpreter to

 ensure that the correct version of `perl-base' is installed. It

 additionally contains the shared Perl library on architectures where the

 perl binary is linked to libperl.a (currently only i386, for performance

 reasons). In other cases the actual library is in the `perl-base' package.

[perl](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/perl):
Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language

Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over

 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from

 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping

 and large scale development projects.

 .

 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,

 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported

 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate

 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database

 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides

 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

[perl-base](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/perl-base):
minimal Perl system

Perl is a scripting language used in many system scripts and utilities.

 .

 This package provides a Perl interpreter and the small subset of the

 standard run-time library required to perform basic tasks. For a full

 Perl installation, install "perl" (and its dependencies, "perl-modules"

 and "perl-doc").

[perl-debug](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/perl-debug):
debug-enabled Perl interpreter

debugperl provides a debug-enabled version of Perl which can produce

 extensive information about the interpreter as it compiles and executes

 a program (see the -D switch in perlrun(1)).

 .

 Note that this package is primarily of use in debugging \*Perl\* rather

 than perl programs, which may be traced/debugged using the standard

 perl binary using the -d switch (see perldebug(1)).

[perl-doc](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/perl-doc):
Perl documentation

Perl manual pages, POD documentation and the `perldoc' program. If you are

 writing Perl programs, you almost certainly need this.

[perl-modules](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/perl-modules):
Core Perl modules

Architecture independent Perl modules. These modules are part of Perl and

 required if the `perl' package is installed.

 .

 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be

 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.

 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they

 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2016-742bde2be7
2016-07-18 15:51:19.078569
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : perl
Product : Fedora 23
Version : 5.22.2
Release : 353.fc23
URL : <http://www.perl.org/>
Summary : Practical Extraction and Report Language
Description :
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.

Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your system to
handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter.

If your script requires some Perl modules, you can install them with
"perl(MODULE)" where "MODULE" is a name of required module. E.g. install
"perl(Test::More)" to make Test::More Perl module available.

If you need all the Perl modules that come with upstream Perl sources, so
called core modules, install perl-core package.

If you only need perl run-time as a shared library, i.e. Perl interpreter
embedded into another application, the only essential package is perl-libs.

Perl header files can be found in perl-devel package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This fixes CVE-2016-6185 vulnerability (do not let XSLoader load relative

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2016-eb2592245b
2016-07-15 14:08:32.485046
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : perl
Product : Fedora 22
Version : 5.20.3
Release : 332.fc22
URL : <http://www.perl.org/>
Summary : Practical Extraction and Report Language
Description :
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming. A large
proportion of the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl. You need the
perl package installed on your system so that your system can handle Perl
scripts.

Install this package if you want to program in Perl or enable your system to
handle Perl scripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This fixes CVE-2016-6185 vulnerability (do not let XSLoader load relative
paths).

Subject: CVE Request: perl: XSLoader: could load shared library from
 incorrect location

Hi,

Jakub Wilk reported in [1] that the Perl module List::MoreUtils tried
to load code from a subdirectory of the current working directory
despite explicitly removing the current directory from @INC, which
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if cwd is unstrusted, as
demonstrated in the bugreport.

While analyzing the issue[2], it turns out that the issue is actually in
XSLoader, which uses caller() information to locate the .so file to
load. This can be incorrect if XSLoader::load() is called in a string
eval. The fix commited upstream is [3].

@MITRE: Could you please assign a CVE for this issue in XSLoader? Do
you think List::MoreUtils needs a separate CVE as well, despite the
underlying issue lying in XSLoader[4]?

Regards,
Salvatore

## Details

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Perl to

hang, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-8853](/security/CVE-2015-8853))

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly loaded libraries from the current

working directory. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-6185](/security/CVE-2016-6185))

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled the rmtree and remove\_tree

functions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to set the mode

on arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-6512](/security/CVE-2017-6512))

Brian Carpenter discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10.

([CVE-2018-6797](/security/CVE-2018-6797))

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Perl in Context

### Market Niche

Perl powered almost the entirety of the early world wide web. To some, Perl is a primarily thought of as a glue language. To others, it's thought of as the "Swiss Army Chainsaw" of languages that allow for quick hacks to solve to complex problems. Because Perl is highly performant compared to most interpreted languages and it has a shell-like syntax. Consequently, it is often easier to maintain than equivalent scripts written in Bash. Additionally, thanks to the Mojolicious framework deploying modern microservices in Perl is almost trivial. This allows for Perl to hold its own in modern DevOps environments.

### Pros

* Perl is multiparadigm: procedural, object oriented, and functional programming styles are supported.
* Perl makes writing microservices very easy with the Mojolicious web framework.
* The basic syntax is easy to learn, especially for those already familiar with [C](/wiki/C "C") or a POSIX shell.
* Modern Perl is as readable as Ruby.
* For an interpreted language, Perl is quite fast. Perl VM startup time is much faster than [Java](/wiki/Java "Java") and execution times are typically on par with [Python](/wiki/Python "Python").
* It has a vast library of modules stored in the CPAN library, which is comparable to size and scope to Python's Pip.
* Perl's Corinna object system is both low boilerplate and very expressive.
* Perl deprecates features far less frequently than other languages, thus scripts can run unmodified *much* longer than is typical for most languages, except perhaps C.

### Cons

* While Perl remains a popular choice for some tasks its developer community has shrank considerably from its heyday, having lost a lot of ground to Python. It now has a developer community similar in size to that of PHP.
* In Perl there is always "More than one way to do it!" (TIMTOWTDI). On the one hand this allows for very expressive code, on the other hand this can be confusing to inexperienced developers.
* Advanced uses of Perl involve a lot of "magic" behind the scenes that can be surprising to new developers. This allows for code that can be downright laconic.
* Perl's regular expression syntax, though wildly ported to other languages thanks to the PCRE library, takes a while to get used to.

### Complimentary Languages

Perl is closely related to [Raku](/wiki/Raku "Raku") and the two languages do share some syntax. Perl took inspiriation from C, grep, and awk. Both [PHP](/wiki/PHP "PHP") and [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby "Ruby") took a lot of inspiration from Perl.

## Introduction

The Perl language itself is packaged as dev-lang/perl. There're three Perl-related categories:

1. [dev-perl](https://packages.gentoo.org/categories/dev-perl): Libraries in / for Perl, corresponding to dev-java, dev-python, etc. In most cases the package name directly corresponds to a [CPAN](/wiki/CPAN "CPAN") distribution.
2. [perl-core](https://packages.gentoo.org/categories/perl-core): Packages in this category are modules included in dev-lang/perl, which are also independently packaged on CPAN. When modules are installed via perl-core, they override the counterpart in the core dev-lang/perl. This can be used for selective bugfixes. For the details, see below - but please **never manually install any perl-core packages with emerge**.
3. [virtual/perl-\*](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/search?q=virtual%2Fperl): Virtual packages that allow choosing a module between perl-core/ packages and the one contained in the core dev-lang/perl. If you need a specific version of a core package, emerge the corresponding virtual - and the package manager will figure out if a perl-core/ package is needed or not.

More on perl-core[[1]](#cite_note-1):

* It allows users to have more update versions of some modules that the core ones.
* It allows package-based installation, without bumping or patching the core perl.
* Sometimes these modules get deprecated in newer Perl. Such cases are handled by virtual/perl-\*. Search [[1]](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608168#c1) for "Module::Build" for more in-depth stories.

Normally you do not have to care at all about perl-core packages or virtuals; if you need any specifics there they should be pulled in as dependencies.

## Installation

### USE flags

#### Global

Since many packages depend on the perl, Portage is aware of the [perl](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/perl) [USE flag](/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag"). It can be enabled (or disabled) globally:

FILE **`/etc/portage/make.conf`**
```
USE="perl"

```

This is typically only required if carrying out a lot of Perl development locally.

#### Package

### USE flags for [dev-lang/perl](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-lang/perl) Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language

| `[berkdb](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/berkdb)` | Add support for sys-libs/db (Berkeley DB for MySQL) |
| --- | --- |
| `[doc](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/doc)` | Add extra documentation (API, Javadoc, etc). It is recommended to enable per package instead of globally |
| `[gdbm](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/gdbm)` | Add support for sys-libs/gdbm (GNU database libraries) |
| `[minimal](https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/minimal)` | Install a very minimal build (disables, for example, plugins, fonts, most drivers, non-critical features) |

Last update: 2025-01-24 16:25

[More information about USE flags](/wiki/Handbook%3AAMD64/Working/USE)

As always, after adjusting USE flags, be sure to tell Portage to apply the changes to installed packages on the system:

`root #``emerge --ask --update --changed-use --deep --autounmask-keep-masks=y @world`

In addition, after changing the `ithreads` or `debug` use flag setting, you need to re-build all packages installing perl modules or linking to libperl:

`root #``perl-cleaner --reallyall`
## Upgrading

The official way of upgrading Perl, e.g. from Perl 5.36 to Perl 5.38, is upgrading your entire world, and upgrading Perl with it. This is because Portage needs to be able to rebuild packages depending on Perl. If you ask Portage to selectively only upgrade the Perl package itself, it can't do this and the emerge command will fail.

As in all cases when automatic rebuilds are involved, it helps a lot if you do regular updates and regularly run depclean.

### The official way

`root #``emerge -uDNav --autounmask-keep-masks=y @world``root #``perl-cleaner --all`

If this fails, please check your world file for packages which cannot be updated/reinstalled because they've been removed or are in some way masked.

### Some knowledge

* Perl modules are installed under *e.g.,* /usr/lib/perl5/vendor\_perl/5.36/. Note that the core Perl version number is present. When upgrading Perl by a major version, the packages providing these modules have to be re-emerged, too.
* The same is valid for all packages linking to libperl.
* The rebuilds 'should' be done automatically by emerge. `app-admin/perl-cleaner` exists to do them as well and can catch things missed by emerge (sadly Portage still has some bugs).
* During Perl upgrade, packages that depend on Perl may become unavailable.
* **No rebuilds are necessary during a point-release update** (i.e. from 5.36.0 to 5.36.1).

In order to upgrade your Perl installation to unstable (~arch) version on an otherwise stable system, add the following text to `/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords`:

```
# use Perl from ~arch
dev-lang/perl
perl-core/*
virtual/perl-*

```

Perl itself, the perl-core packages and the Perl virtuals 'must' have the same, consistent status (either all stable or all ~arch). What setting you use for dev-perl packages does not matter at all.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I list all Perl modules installed from CPAN?

The following [Bash](/wiki/Bash "Bash") one-liner can give you a list of all modules:

CODE **List Perl CPAN Modules**
```
for MODULE in `perldoc -t perllocal | grep Module | sed -e 's/^.*" //'`; do VERSION=`perldoc -t perllocal | awk "/$MODULE/{y=1;next}y" | grep VERSION | head -n 1`; printf "%30s %s\n" "$MODULE" "$VERSION"; done | sort

```

cwd is untrusted.

Thanks for the report.

As discussed in the upstream ticket, the root cause is XSLoader, which
uses caller() information to locate the .so file to load. This can be
incorrect if XSLoader::load() is called in a string eval.

  <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=115808>

I'm cloning a separate bug against perl about this; XSLoader
is already fixed upstream with

 <http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/08e3451d7>

There's a simple workaround for List::MoreUtils in the upstream ticket
included below. I think we should apply this in any case as it improves
the diagnostics.

I'm setting the severity of the XSLoader bug to 'important';
the circumstances are rare enough that I don't think it should be
release-critical at this point as long as List-MoreUtils gets patched.

I'll still try to fix it in perl soon, and we can revisit this if other
packages turn out to be affected.

     modules can make many programs unintentionally load code
     from the current working directory (which might be changed to
     another directory without the user realising).
     + allow user configurable removal of "." from @INC in

       even if the user does not configure "." to be removed from @INC
     + backport patches from [perl #127810] to fix various classes of
       build failures in perl and CPAN modules if "." is removed from
       @INC

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1354386#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-11 08:29:31 UTC  ``` An arbitrary code execution can be achieved if loading code from untrusted current working directory despite the '.' is removed from @INC. Vulnerability is in XSLoader that uses caller() information to locate .so file to load. If malicious attacker creates directory named `(eval 1)` with malicious binary file in it, it will be loaded if the package calling XSLoader is in parent directory.

Package        : perl
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-1238 CVE-2016-6185
Debian Bug     : 829578

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the implementation of the
Perl programming language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2016-1238

    John Lightsey and Todd Rinaldo reported that the opportunistic
    loading of optional modules can make many programs unintentionally
    load code from the current working directory (which might be changed
    to another directory without the user realising) and potentially
    leading to privilege escalation, as demonstrated in Debian with
    certain combinations of installed packages.

    The problem relates to Perl loading modules from the includes
    directory array ("@INC") in which the last element is the current
    directory ("."). That means that, when "perl" wants to load a module
    (during first compilation or during lazy loading of a module in run-
    time), perl will look for the module in the current directory at the
    end, since '.' is the last include directory in its array of include
    directories to seek. The issue is with requiring libraries that are
    in "." but are not otherwise installed.

    With this update several modules which are known to be vulnerable
    are updated to not load modules from current directory.

    Additionally the update allows configurable removal of "." from @INC
    in /etc/perl/sitecustomize.pl for a transitional period. It is
    recommended to enable this setting if the possible breakage for a
    specific site has been evaluated. Problems in packages provided in
    Debian resulting from the switch to the removal of '.' from @INC
    should be reported to the Perl maintainers at
    perl@packages.debian.org .

    It is planned to switch to the default removal of '.' in @INC in a
    subsequent update to perl via a point release if possible, and in
    any case for the upcoming stable release Debian 9 (stretch).

CVE-2016-6185

    It was discovered that XSLoader, a core module from Perl to
    dynamically load C libraries into Perl code, could load shared
    library from incorrect location. XSLoader uses caller() information
    to locate the .so file to load. This can be incorrect if
    XSLoader::load() is called in a string eval. An attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.20.2-3+deb8u6. Additionally this update includes the
following updated packages to address optional module loading
vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-1238, or to address build failures
which occur when '.' is removed from @INC:

 - cdbs 0.4.130+deb8u1
 - debhelper 9.20150101+deb8u2
 - devscripts 2.15.3+deb8u1
 - exim4 4.84.2-2+deb8u1
 - libintl-perl 1.23-1+deb8u1
 - libmime-charset-perl 1.011.1-1+deb8u2
 - libmime-encwords-perl 1.014.3-1+deb8u1
 - libmodule-build-perl 0.421000-2+deb8u1
 - libnet-dns-perl 0.81-2+deb8u1
 - libsys-syslog-perl 0.33-1+deb8u1
 - libunicode-linebreak-perl 0.0.20140601-2+deb8u2

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.
