  "CVE-2016-6185": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The XSLoader module in Perl uses caller() information to locate the .so file to load. This can be incorrect if XSLoader::load() is called in a string eval.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of paths by XSLoader leading to loading shared libraries from untrusted locations.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Perl process.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with ability to create directories and place malicious shared libraries in a path where a Perl script may load them from.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker capable of manipulating the current working directory and creating files within it."
