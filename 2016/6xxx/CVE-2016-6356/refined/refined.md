Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances. It is related to how the software processes corrupted attachment fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation when parsing email attachment fields within message/content filtering. Specifically, the software does not properly handle corrupted or malformed attachment fields.
- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the affected Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) to stop scanning and forwarding email messages. This leads to a DoS condition, disrupting normal email flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted email with corrupted attachment fields to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate or have any prior access to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send email messages to the vulnerable ESA.
- **Crafted Email:** The attacker needs to craft an email with malformed or corrupted attachment fields designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances prior to the first fixed release, if the software is configured to use a message or content filter on incoming attachments.
- The vulnerability is not limited to any specific rules or actions within the message or content filters.
