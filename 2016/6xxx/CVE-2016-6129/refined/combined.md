| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1370955#c0)  Jeremy Choi    2016-08-28 23:50:24 UTC  ``` It has been reported that libtomcrypt may be vulnerable to a Bleichenbacher attack due to a vulnerability in rsa_verify_hash.c  CERT has provided the details from Intel Security Advanced Threat Research team.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack in OP-TEE       Background       The implementation for RSA signature verification of PKCS 1 v1.5 in the Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment (<https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os>) appears to be vulnerable to a Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack. The vulnerability may result in RSA signature or public certificate forgery when a low public exponent (for example, e = 3) is used.           Vulnerability       The function rsa_verify_hash_ex (<https://github.com/OPTEE/optee_os/blob/master/core/lib/libtomcrypt/src/pk/rsa/rsa_verify_hash.c>) does not check the number of remaining bytes in the decrypted message after ASN.1 encoded data.   The function decodes the ASN.1 message and checks that it has the correct structure and values (OID and hash). This permits additional data after the ASN.1 message that can be used to forge a PKCS1 v1.5 signature for keys with a low public exponent. The original variant of the attack is described here: <https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/openpgp/current/msg00999.html>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1370955#c1)  Jeremy Choi    2016-08-28 23:51:15 UTC  ```  Created libtomcrypt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1370956](show_bug.cgi?id=1370956 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-6129 libtomcrypt: possible OP-TEE Bleichenbacher attack [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1370957](show_bug.cgi?id=1370957 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6129 libtomcrypt: possible OP-TEE Bleichenbacher attack [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1370955#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-09-07 14:18:42 UTC  ``` Upstream fix:  <https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/commit/30d13250c390c4f56adefdcd3b64b7cc672f9fe2> <https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/commit/5eb9743410ce4657e9d54fef26a2ee31a1b5dd09>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1370955#c3)  Borja Tarraso    2017-07-04 14:39:22 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Borja Tarraso (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1370955#c4)  Borja Tarraso    2017-07-14 09:00:00 UTC  ``` RHEV should take the pkgs from the base OS - but double checking with PM to be sure before marking this as fixed.   ``` |  |
