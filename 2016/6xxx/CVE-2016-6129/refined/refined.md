Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6129:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `rsa_verify_hash_ex` function within the libtomcrypt library, specifically how it handles PKCS #1 v1.5 signature verification. The function fails to check for extraneous bytes after the ASN.1 encoded data within the decrypted message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Length Checking:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of the decrypted message length after ASN.1 decoding. This allows for extra bytes to be appended to the ASN.1 structure.
- **Bleichenbacher Attack Vector:**  The vulnerability makes the library susceptible to a Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack, particularly when RSA keys with low public exponents (e.g., e=3) are used. This attack leverages the ability to control the extra bytes added after the ASN.1 data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Signature Forgery:** A successful attack allows an adversary to forge RSA signatures.
- **Public Certificate Forgery:** This could lead to the forging of public certificates.
- **Compromised Authentication:** Potentially allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms that rely on RSA signature verification.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Signature:** The attacker crafts a malicious signature that includes the correct ASN.1 encoded data (OID and hash) followed by carefully constructed extra bytes.
- **Low Public Exponent:** The attack is more feasible when the RSA key uses a low public exponent, like 3.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Knowledge of RSA and PKCS #1 v1.5:** The attacker needs knowledge of the RSA algorithm and how PKCS #1 v1.5 padding works.
- **Ability to Craft Signatures:** The attacker must have the ability to craft RSA signatures that contain the malicious extra bytes.
- **Target System using libtomcrypt:** The attacker needs to target a system that uses a vulnerable version of `libtomcrypt` for RSA signature verification.
- **Low Public Exponent Usage:** Attack is more effective against systems using RSA keys with a small public exponent (e.g., e=3)

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Intel Security Advanced Threat Research team.
- The vulnerability exists in the `rsa_verify_hash_ex` function specifically in `src/pk/rsa/rsa_verify_hash.c`.
- The vulnerability was present in the OP-TEE project.
- A fix was implemented in the upstream libtomcrypt repository as well as in the OP-TEE project.
- Red Hat tracked this issue across various products including Fedora and EPEL.
