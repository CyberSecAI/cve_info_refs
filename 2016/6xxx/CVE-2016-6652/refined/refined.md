Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6652:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way Spring Data JPA handles `Sort` instances within manually declared JPQL queries. When a `Sort` object, especially one constructed from untrusted sources (e.g., web request parameters), is directly passed to the persistence provider, it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JPQL into the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:**  Attackers can inject arbitrary JPQL code into the `ORDER BY` clause of a query. Because the results are ordered in a specific way, they can draw conclusions about non-exposed fields.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize or validate the contents of the `Sort` instance before passing it to the persistence provider.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By carefully crafting injected JPQL code, attackers can infer information about non-exposed fields based on the order of the returned data. This enables them to potentially identify the existence of specific data, or data patterns they are not authorized to view.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Input:** The primary attack vector is through user-controlled input, such as web request parameters, that are used to construct `Sort` instances.
*   **JPQL Injection in ORDER BY:** The vulnerability allows arbitrary JPQL code to be injected into the `ORDER BY` clause via the `Sort` object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to control Sort parameters**: The attacker must have the ability to influence the `Sort` instance that is passed to the vulnerable query method. This can be achieved if the application allows the user to specify ordering criteria through parameters (e.g. in a web request).
*   **Knowledge of the application**: The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's endpoints and parameters which can be used to specify the order by clause.
*   **Basic understanding of JPQL:** The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of JPQL in order to construct an injection.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was addressed by sanitizing `Sort` instances to only allow references to domain object fields and aliases defined in the JPQL query, and introducing a `JpaSort.unsafe(â€¦)` method for situations where the old behavior is required, allowing complex sort expressions when necessary.
*   Affected versions are Spring Data JPA 1.10.2 and 1.9.4 (and potentially other unsupported versions), and users were advised to upgrade to 1.10.4 or 1.9.6.
* The vulnerability is described as "MEDIUM" severity in the provided content.
