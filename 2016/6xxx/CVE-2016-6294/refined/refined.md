{
  "CVE-2016-6294": {
    "Description": "Calling to uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP with parameter size \"httpAcceptLanguage\" equal or greater than ULOC_FULLNAME_CAPACITY + 1, the local variable \"tmp\" might leave unterminated.  uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP doesnâ€™t check status result after call to uloc_canonicalize. This might cause stack data leak.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP` function within the libicu library. Specifically, when the input parameter `httpAcceptLanguage` exceeds the `ULOC_FULLNAME_CAPACITY + 1`, the function fails to ensure that the local variable 'tmp' is properly null-terminated. Additionally, the function doesn't validate the result status after calling `uloc_canonicalize`, which might lead to a stack data leak.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds access",
      "Lack of input validation",
	  "Missing status check",
	  "Potential stack data leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "A stack buffer overflow and potential stack data leak may occur.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP Accept-Language header with a size greater than `ULOC_FULLNAME_CAPACITY + 1`."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the HTTP Accept-Language header, which is typically possible through a web client."
