Subject: Browsing and attaching images considered harmful in Linux

Hi,

I would like to bring the attention of the oss-security list to the
existence of many security issues in the gdk-pixbuf library and its
dependencies causing a that attaching a corrupted image file in Linux
has become a risky business. For instance,  there is a read
out-of-bounds in librsvg2 (a dependency of gdk-pixbuf used to render
svg images), which can be easily triggered if you try to attach a svg
in Firefox. I tested it in Ubuntu 14.04 (x86_64) using the
corresponding version of librsvg2 (2.40.2-1 with debug symbols) and
Firefox. To reproduce:

1. Download and unpack boom.tar.gz somewhere.
2. gdb --args /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
3. Execute "run" and try to attach (ctrl+o) the svg file inside boom
directory in Firefox.

Result:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

It is interesting to note that rcx looks controllable:

(gdb) x/i $rip
=> 0x7fffbb7a4c0d <rsvg_pattern_fix_fallback+333>:        testb  $0x4,0xe4(%rcx)
(gdb) info registers
...
rcx            0xe5e5e5e5e5e5e5e5        -1880844493789993499
...

Fortunately, this issue is already solved in the last revision of
librsvg2 (AFAIK, this issue has no CVE, so please MITRE assign one if
suitable). Nevertheless, I reported such vulnerability to Mozilla more
than a month ago hoping that they will disable the svg support in the
open/attach widget. After some discussion, it was marked as WONTFIX.
While i understand why, i still feel it can be productive to discuss
this here.

(the same trick can be used to crash Chrome/Chromium, since the code
to open/attach an image is almost the same, so this is not a Firefox
specific issue)

Regards,
Gustavo

Use CVE-2016-6163 for this specific "read out-of-bounds in librsvg2 (a
dependency of gdk-pixbuf used to render svg images)."

(We cannot assign CVE IDs for the more general topic of "many security
issues in the gdk-pixbuf library and its dependencies" without
additional information.)
