## Security process

We take security issues seriously and welcome responsible disclosure from researchers discovering vulnerabilities in Foreman. Please email foreman-security@googlegroups.com (a private address for the security team) with all reports. If you notice the security issue is related to a particular plugin, please mention the plugin within the body of the email to help us in routing the issue to the most authoritative source.

We will endeavour to resolve high severity issues in the current stable release and lower severity issues in the next major release. Announcements of security issues will be made on this page and in the [Release Announcements category of our community forums](https://community.theforeman.org/c/release-announcements/8) when a release containing a fix is available to end users and credit will be given to the researcher if desired.

The policy of the project is to treat all newly reported issues as private, and after evaluation, low to medium severity issues will be made public while high severity issues will be fixed under an embargo. Typically the project supports only one major (x.y) release at a time, though high severity issues may also be fixed in the previous release if it was only recently superseded.

### Disclosure details

#### CVE-2024-7923: Authentication bypass in Pulpcore

An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Pulpcore when
deployed by the Foreman Installer with Gunicorn versions prior to 22.0.

This issue arises from the way Apache is configured to do certificate authentication and
pass this information to the Gunicorn backend,
without unsetting all headers coming from a possibly malicious client.

* Affects Katello 4.0.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 3.10.1, 3.11.2, 3.12.0
* GitHub PR [puppet-pulpcore#357](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-pulpcore/pull/357)

#### CVE-2024-7012: Authentication bypass in Foreman

An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when
deployed by the Foreman Installer with External Authentication.

pass this information to the Puma backend,
without unsetting all headers coming from a possibly malicious client.

* Affects Foreman 2.2.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 3.10.1, 3.11.2, 3.12.0
* GitHub PR [puppet-foreman#1181](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/pull/1181)

#### CVE-2023-4886: World readable tomcat server.xml contains passwords

The world readable file `/etc/tomcat/server.xml` contains passwords for the keystore and truststore.
The actual stores are limited by file permissions, but `server.xml` should also be limited.

* Affects Katello
* Fix released in Foreman 3.8.0
* Redmine issue [#36760](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/36760)

#### CVE-2022-4130: Blind SSRF via Referer header

* Affects Foreman
* Fix released in Foreman 3.8.0
* Redmine issue [#36768](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/36768)

#### CVE-2022-3874: OS command injection via ct\_command and fcct\_command

`ct_command` and `fcct_command` settings, available via Administer - Settings, both accept arbitrary
strings as the command name and calling CoreOS templates will execute those commands as the user Foreman runs under.
By default, only Foreman super administrator can access settings.

* Affects Foreman 3.2.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 3.8.0
* Redmine issue [#36759](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/36759)

* Affects Foreman Azure RM 2.0.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman Azure RM 2.2.0 and higher
* Redmine issue [#31938](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/31938)

#### CVE-2020-14335: World readable dhcp OMAPI secret could expose dhcp API access

OMAPI key used to secure dhcp API access could have been read by anyone with access to the hosting system.

*Mitigation:* override `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file mode to `0640` and ensure access to the file for user `foreman-proxy` by other means.

On Red Hat based systems, acls are used by default, so you need to only set less permissive mode and you should be set.
On Debian based systems, you need to install acls and set read access to the `/etc/dhcp` directory by acls.
To set correct acls install `acl` package and use `setfacl -R -m u:foreman-proxy:rx /etc/dhcp`.

In case the system may have been accessed locally by an un-trusted user, it may be prudent to change the OMAPI secret for dhcp.

* Affects foreman-proxy installations with dhcp feature protected by `dhcp_key_secret` since Foreman 1.0
* Fix released in Foreman 2.2.0 and 2.1.3 and higher
* Redmine issue [#30489](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/30489)

#### CVE-2020-14380: Users can gain elevated rights when logging via external authentication

Users that are authenticated using `external` authentication methods such as Kerberos, OpenID Connect or Apache SSO can gain the rights of an `internal` user. This is possible only when the username of an internal and external user is the same.

* Affects external user authentication since Foreman 1.4
* Fix released in Foreman 2.2.0, 2.1.3 and 2.0.3 and higher
* Redmine issue [#30739](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/30739)

#### CVE-2020-14334: World readable cache could expose sensitive settings

Even encrypted settings have their raw values cached. Too permissive mode on cache dir caused, that anyone with access to the hosting system could read this encrypted settings.

*Mitigation:* override `/run/foreman` directory mode to `0750`.
To do so in a manner that survives reboot, update the file `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/foreman.conf`.

```
d /run/foreman 0750 foreman foreman -

```

For the change to have effect immediately run `systemd-tmpfiles --create`.

In case the system may have been accessed locally by an un-trusted user, it may be prudent to change any secrets stored in the settings, such as OAuth keys or remote execution passwords.

* Affects RPM installations using file cache since Foreman 1.3
* Fix released in Foreman 2.2.0, 2.1.1 and 2.0.2 and higher
* Redmine issue [#30490](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/30490)

* Affects Foreman tasks 0.7.8 and higher.
* Fix released in Foreman tasks 0.15.7 and higher.
* Redmine issue [#27275](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27275)

#### CVE-2019-3845: Lack of access control around Qpid message broker

Katello installations include the Apache Qpid message broker and dispatch router services. It was found that due to the lack of access permissions around the message broker and router, clients using the katello-agent for package management could invoke QMF (QPid Management Framework) actions against the broker. QMF enables broker settings, queues, exchanges, etc. to be manipulated and those actions could compromise communication between hosts and the server, or allow undesired katello-agent actions to be invoked across clients. This issue was reported by Pavel Moravec.

* Affects Katello 1.4 and higher.
* Fix released with Foreman 1.20.3 (Katello 3.10.1), Foreman 1.21.3 (Katello 3.11.1) and higher.

#### CVE-2016-6320: network interface device identifiers may contain stored XSS on host form

Network interface identifiers stored for hosts may contain HTML or JavaScript that allows a stored XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerability when later viewing the host edit form.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.

* Affects Foreman 1.8.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.2
* Redmine issue [#16022](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16022)

#### CVE-2016-6319: Foreman form helpers do not escape JS when rendering label

Label parameter of all form helpers was not escaped allowing XSS (cross-site scripting). The Foreman itself did not contain exploitable code but other plugins that relied on form helpers could be vulnerable. One known vulnerable plugin is Remote Execution. All versions of this plugin are affected.

* Affects Foreman 1.6.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.2
* Redmine issue [#16024](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16024)

#### CVE-2016-5390: API host interfaces data not restricted by view\_hosts filters

Non-admin users with the view\_hosts permission containing a filter are able to access API routes beneath âhostsâ such as GET /api/v2/hosts/secrethost/interfaces without the filter being taken into account. This allows users to access network interface details (including BMC login details) for any host.

The filter is only correctly used when accessing the main host details (/api/v2/hosts/secrethost). Access to the ânestedâ routes, which includes interfaces, reports, parameters, audits, facts and Puppet classes, is not authorized beyond requiring any view\_hosts permission.

* Affects Foreman 1.10.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.1 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15653](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15653)

#### CVE-2016-4995: information disclosure through unauthorized template previews

Users who are logged in with permissions to view some hosts are able to preview provisioning templates for any host by specifying its hostname in the URL, as the specific view\_hosts permissions and filters arenât checked.

If the organization or location features are enabled, the user will still be restricted to their associated orgs/locs.

* Affects Foreman 1.11.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.1 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15490](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15490)

#### CVE-2016-4475: Privilege escalation in Organization and Locations API and UI

When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization or location, these are not taken into account in the API or parts of the UI. This allows a user to view, edit and delete organizations and locations they are not associated with if they have the requisite permissions.

*Mitigation:* make sure you have filters restricted to organizations or locations when you limit user by assigning them to particular organizations or locations.

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.0-RC3 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15268](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15268)

#### CVE-2016-4451: Privilege escalation through Organization and Locations API

When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization, if users know other organization id and have unlimited filters they can access/modify other organization data. They just have to set the id as API parameter.

*Mitigation:* make sure you have filters restricted to organizations or locations when you limit user by assigning him particular organization or location.

* Affects Foreman 1.7 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.0-RC1 and 1.11.3
* Redmine issue [#15812](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15182)

#### CVE-2016-3728: remote code execution in smart proxy TFTP API

The smart proxy TFTP API is vulnerable to arbitrary remote code execution, as it passes untrusted user input (the PXE template type) to the eval() function causing it to be executed.

Thanks to Lukas Zapletal for reporting the issue.

*Mitigation:* ensure `trusted_hosts` is set in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml`, HTTPS is in use and `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/tftp.yml` is configured for `https` only (if enabled).

* Affects Foreman 0.2 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.11.2 and 1.10.4
* Redmine issue [#14931](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/14931)

#### CVE-2016-3693: application information leakage through templates

A provisioning template containing `inspect` will expose sensitive information about the Rails controller and application when rendered when using Safemode rendering (the default setting). This includes the application secret token, possibly permitting a privilege escalation.

Thanks to Ivan Necas for reporting the issue.

As a precaution, the security token may be regenerated with:

1. `chown foreman /usr/share/foreman/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`
2. `foreman-rake security:generate_token`
3. `chown root /usr/share/foreman/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`

*Mitigation:* remove edit\_provisioning\_templates from untrusted users.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.11.1
* Redmine issue [#14635](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/14635)

#### Ruby code execution via Discovery settings

It is possible to run arbitrary Ruby code entering it on the Administer -
Settings - Discovery and then visiting a discovered host detail page where it
gets rendered.

* Affects Foreman Discovery 4.2.0 to 5.0.1 (gem releases only, rc and nightly builds)
* Discovery plugin 4.1 series (shipped with Foreman 1.10) was *not* affected.
* Fixed in Discovery plugin 5.0.2
* Redmine issue [#14140](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/14140)

#### CVE-2016-2100: private bookmarks can be viewed and edited

Bookmarks set to âprivateâ can be viewed by any user, and edited or deleted by any user granted the edit or destroy\_bookmarks permissions.

*Mitigation:* remove edit\_bookmarks and destroy\_bookmarks from untrusted users, remove private information from bookmark searches.

* Affects Foreman 0.3 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.11.0-RC2 and 1.10.3
* Redmine issue [#13828](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/13828)

#### CVE-2015-7518: parameter information popup allows stored XSS

The popup boxes next to global parameters, smart class parameters and smart variables on the host and host group edit forms can allow stored XSS to be executed in the browser from the parameter description etc.

*Mitigation:* do not click on the information popup box next to parameters in the host/group forms, and/or remove permission to edit Puppet classes from untrusted users.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0
* Redmine issue [#12611](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/12611)

#### SQL injection via facts search terms

The search for facts and also hosts by facts is vulnerable to SQL injection by breaking out of quotes in either the fact name or the fact value.

No CVE identifier will be assigned to this vulnerability as it affects only release candidates.

* Affects Foreman 1.10.0-RC1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0-RC3
* Redmine issue [#12458](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/12458)

#### CVE-2015-5282: parameter hide checkbox allows stored XSS during change

The parameter management UI has a checkbox to mark values as hidden to mask them from casual viewing. The checkbox that hides/shows the value fails to handle HTML properly and so is vulnerable to an XSS issue where HTML can be stored in a parameter, and executed by another user if they later tick/untick the hide box.

* Affects Foreman 1.7.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#11859](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11859)

#### CVE-2015-5246: Active Directory login works with old password after change

*This CVE identifier was assigned before realizing that this was not a bug in Foreman, but a feature of Active Directory. It will remain assigned for future reference only. See [the Active Directory password changes](/manuals/latest/index.html#4.1.1LDAPAuthentication) section of the manual or [Microsoft KB906305](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/906305) for more details.*

When using an Active Directory instance to log into Foreman (via an LDAP authentication source), it is possible to log into Foreman for up to one hour after a password change in AD using the old password.

* Fix to Foreman not required, reconfigure Active Directory
* Redmine issue [#11471](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11471)

#### CVE-2015-5233: reports show/destroy not restricted by host authorization

Users with view\_reports or destroy\_reports permissions allows a user to view or delete reports from any host without taking their view\_hosts permission into account.

The reports list and other views combine the reports and hosts permissions to only show reports for hosts that a user can view, but the individual report show/delete pages and APIs do not apply the hosts permissions.

*Mitigation:* remove view\_reports and destroy\_reports permissions from users until a fix is available, or add a search query to the role filter to restrict it.

* Affects Foreman 1.5.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.1 and 1.8.4
* Redmine issue [#11579](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11579)

#### CVE-2015-5152: require\_ssl does not enforce HTTPS on API

The ârequire\_sslâ setting in /etc/foreman/settings.yml should enforce that web requests sent to Foreman over HTTP are redirected to HTTPS, but this was found not to happen with API requests (e.g. from Hammer CLI). Foreman will process API requests over HTTP, but should have redirected.

Redirection wonât help with credentials having already been sent, but should give some notification that the user/app is using the wrong URL.

*Mitigation:* add the following to the Apache HTTP VirtualHost, e.g. in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/05-foreman.d/api_request.conf`:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/api/(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/api/$1 [R,L]

```

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#11119](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11119)

#### CVE-2015-3235: edit\_users permission allows changing of admin passwords

A user with the edit\_users permission (e.g. with the Manager role) is allowed to edit admin users. This allows them to change the password of the admin userâs account and gain access to it.

*Mitigation:* change roles of users with the edit\_users permission, remove the *Unlimited* flag and set a search query of `admin = false`.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#10829](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10829)

#### CVE-2015-3199: Discovery: auto provision rule not enforcing org/locations

*This CVE identifier was assigned before realizing that no released versions of Foreman Discovery were affected. It will remain assigned for future reference only.*

The Foreman Discovery plugin auto provisioning rules do not enforce that the rule and the assigned host group are in the same organization and location. This can allow a rule to be configured with mismatched orgs/locations, and for another user who has access to the rule but not the host group, to run it and provision a host into a group in a different org/location to their own.

* Affects no released versions of Foreman Discovery
* Fix released in Foreman Discovery 4.0.0
* Redmine issue [#10469](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10469)

#### CVE-2015-3155: session cookie set without secure flag on HTTPS

The session cookie created when accessing the Foreman web UI over HTTPS is not set with the âsecureâ flag, which may lead to session hijacking.

If a user successfully logs into Foreman, then accesses Foreman over HTTP (which redirects to HTTPS, but with a window of opportunity), the session ID will be sent unencrypted and the session may be hijacked by an attacker.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.8.1
* Redmine issue [#10275](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10275)

#### CVE-2015-1844: users are not restricted to organizations/locations

When a non-admin user is associated to organizations or locations, their access is not correctly restricted. API access allows access to resources in any org/location, and UI access when the user is associated to more than one org/location is not restricted.

This allows users to read, edit and perform actions on resources (e.g. hosts) outside of the organizations or locations they have been assigned to.

* Affects Foreman 1.2.0 (TBC) and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.8.0-RC3 and 1.7.5
* Redmine issue [#9947](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/9947)

#### CVE-2015-1816: SSL certificate not verified on LDAP connections

When making an SSL connection to an LDAP authentication source in Foreman, the remote server certificate is accepted without any verification against known certificate authorities.

This can allow the LDAP connection between Foreman and the LDAP server to be attacked, and a different LDAP server could be contacted to authenticate users to Foreman.

* Affects Foreman 1.3.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.7.4 and 1.8.0-RC2
* Redmine issue [#9858](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/9858)

#### CVE-2014-3691: SSL certificate verification bypass in smart proxy

The smart proxy (foreman-proxy) fails to block connections when no client SSL certificate is supplied, instead permitting any request. Typically the smart proxy is configured to receive HTTPS requests with a client SSL certificate that is signed by the same CA (certificate authority) as its own, preventing unauthorized access to manage services such as DHCP, DNS and the Puppet CA.

It is strongly recommended to mitigate the problem by restricting access to the smart proxy. More information on [foreman-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-announce/jXC5ixybjqo).

## GPG keys

The Foreman project uses multiple GPG keys to sign packages and release artifacts. All stable releases will be signed by one of the keys. Nightly and plugin Debian packages will be signed, while nightly and plugin RPM packages will not (this may change in the future).

Signing for the Debian family of operating systems is via secure apt and more information, including verification steps can be found [on the Debian web site](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt#Debian_archive_key_expiry). RPMs themselves are signed and can be verified using `rpm --checksig PACKAGE`. All yum repository configs set up by foreman-release RPMs or the installer will enable GPG checking by default.

Key management is changing at the time of writing to cycle nightly keys every two years, and issue limited duration keys per stable release.

### Key changes in July 2014

In July 2014 after a server was compromised, the existing GPG key (0xE775FF07) was revoked and replaced with a new key (0x1AA043B8) as a precaution. All existing packages were re-signed with the new key and thereafter, new major releases are signed with new per-release keys.

All users with the old key trusted are urged to immediately disable this as follows:

* Debian users must run `sudo apt-key del E775FF07`
* RPM users must run `sudo rpm -e gpg-pubkey-e775ff07-4cda3cf9`

More information is available in [the announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-announce/BiIT784Mb7Q).

Red Hat Satellite engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on Satellite to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs will be migrated starting at the end of May. If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SAT-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHBA-2016%3A1885)

## Topic

Updated Satellite 6.2 packages that fix several bugs are now available.

## Description

Red Hat Satellite is a system management solution that allows organizations to configure and maintain their systems without the necessity to provide public Internet access to their servers or other client systems. It performs provisioning and configuration management of predefined standard operating environments.

This update adds the following features:

* Satellite 6.2.2 adds additional tooling around bulk subscription management via the user interface and command line. (BZ#1188796, BZ#1267313, BZ#1296978, BZ#1316703, BZ#1366437)
* The discovery plug-in is now enabled by default at install time. (BZ#1318538)
* Satellite 6.2.2. allows users to search job invocations based on the host that is affected. (BZ#1331660)
* Multiple subscriptions of the same type can now be assigned to the same activation key. (BZ#1343067)
* The maximum core and memory limits have been increased. (BZ#1368450)

This update fixes the following bugs:

* Several bugs around upgrading from 6.1 have been resolved. (BZ#1336365, BZ#1361785, BZ#1364778, BZ#1365299)
* The performance and actions of content view promotion have been improved. (BZ#1161643, BZ#1231369, BZ#1275183, BZ#1117753, BZ#1185838)
* Hosts provisioned in a distinct domain from an IDM server could not be registered. The correct options were added to the provisioning templates to allow this to work. (BZ#1209838)
* Several foreman-debug bugs have been fixed. (BZ#1370224, BZ#1274694)
* The admin role could not be assigned to a user group via hammer. This role can now be assigned. (BZ#1281300)
* When integrated with IPA, Satellite did not return an error when hammer was used to update a host. The calls to IPA are now encoded correctly. (BZ#1281687)
* Parameter value processing caused errors in Puppet because of faulty YAML. The parameter system has been enhanced in order to handle additional cases. (BZ#1315282, BZ#1332625)
* The host collection API was not utilizing the host\_id fields. The API has been enhanced with this data. (BZ#1325989)
* The main sync page threw errors upon completion of sync if Capsules were non-responsive. The Capsule communication checking has been improved. (BZ#1326038, BZ#1327292)
* Publishing or promoting a Puppet content view failed with an obtuse error. The publishing process has been updated to avoid this error. (BZ#1332596)
* The katello-remove-orphan job was producing error messages incorrectly which corrupted the emails which were sent. This no longer occurs. (BZ#1334650)
* An unused Puppet class counter was causing database locks. This counter has been removed. (BZ#1336007)
* Re-Registering host with uppercase host name errors 'Name has already been taken'. The look-up logic will now not take case into consideration. (BZ#1361309)
* Custom products, when imported, were not creating subscriptions correctly. The subscriptions are now created and associated properly. (BZ#1362194)
* Network interface names could include JavaScript resulting in a XSS exploit. This possibility has been removed. (BZ#1364235)
* Satellite was misspelled in the installer usage message. The typo has been fixed. (BZ#1364900)
* Derived pools for VDC subscriptions were not showing the correct content. The correct repositories are now shown. (BZ#1366327)

Users of Red Hat Satellite are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata relevant to your system have been applied.

To update this system to include these fixes, ensure your system has access to the latest Red Hat packages. For instructions on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Then re-run the installer to complete the upgrade:

# satellite-installer --scenario satellite --upgrade

or

# satellite-installer --scenario capsule --upgrade

**Description**

To reproduce:

1. setup user with permissions to create architectures
2. make sure you have less than 6 OS in Foreman
3. login as that user, try to create architecture
4. you can see all OSes listed there even if the user does not have any OS
permission

Note that when there are 6 or more OSes, association is authorized properly.

The code that's responsible for this can be found at [1]. I believe it's
present since Foreman 1.1 [2]. Since this is in generic helper, each form
using this helper is vulnerable. It looks like the >= 6 code path (via multiple\_select) had
authorisation implemented in [#7337](/issues/7337 "Bug: organizations UI does not filter resources to associate based upon RBAC (Closed)") for 1.9.0, and the < 6 code path was left untouched.

[1] <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/blob/develop/app/helpers/form_helper.rb#L48-L58>
[2] <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/commit/14d225cc561b6fb2678eb87e9323d7750a06195c>
