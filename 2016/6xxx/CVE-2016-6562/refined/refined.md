Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The ShoreTel Mobility Client application for iOS and Android (versions 9.1.3.109 and earlier for both platforms, specifically 9.1.2.101 and below for iOS) does not properly validate SSL certificates when establishing HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The application fails to verify the authenticity of SSL certificates presented by the server. This means it doesn't check if the certificate is signed by a trusted authority or if it matches the expected server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned on the same network can intercept communication between the mobile app and the server.
*   **Data Exposure:** The attacker can present a bogus SSL certificate, which the app will accept, without the user's knowledge. This allows the attacker to decrypt and view all traffic between the app and the server.
*   **Credentials Theft:** Sensitive information, including login credentials (usernames and passwords), could be captured by the attacker.
*   **Potential Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify the network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack occurs over a network connection.
*   **MITM Position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the mobile device and the server. This often occurs on shared or untrusted networks, like public Wi-Fi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target device (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network or wired LAN).
*   **MITM Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic (e.g., by using an ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning attack).
*   **Fake SSL Certificate:** The attacker must generate a fake SSL certificate for the targeted domain in order to impersonate the legitimate server.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects both iOS and Android versions of the ShoreTel Mobility Client.
* The vendor was initially difficult to contact and notify about the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was reported to CERT/CC and assigned VU#475907
* A fix was released in version 9.1.5.104 of the application.
