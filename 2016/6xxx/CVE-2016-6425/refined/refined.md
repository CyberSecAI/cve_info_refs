Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the HTTP web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (CUIC) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker could conduct an XSS attack against a user of the web interface of the affected system. This could allow the attacker to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser within the context of the CUIC web application.  While the provided information does not specify the exact nature of the malicious scripts, the impact is rated as "Partial" for Integrity, with no impact to Confidentiality or Availability according to CVSS v2.  The vulnerability allows for modification of data on the user interface, which may lead to further actions within the system from the victim's user context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Network**, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- The attack requires **Medium** Access Complexity. It is not a simple, one-click exploit, and could require some user interaction or specific environmental configurations to successfully execute.
- The attacker **does not require authentication** to initiate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CUIC web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Contact Center Express and Cisco Unified Intelligence Center.
- There are no available workarounds.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time the advisory was published.

The provided CVSS v2 score is Base 4.3, Temporal 3.6. The temporal score takes into account that there is functional exploit code available (E:F), and that an official fix is available (RL:OF), and the report has been confirmed (RC:C).
