3 Bugs ﬁxed since previous Public Release

This section provides a summary of bugﬁxes and changes that have been applied subsequently to
shipping Patch Release #3513.

46189 Unable to see Halo or who reserved a resource within the Scheduling tool
No single general solution for all diﬀerent use cases in this scenario.
Solution: Introduced ui setting ’io.ox/calendar//freeBusyStrict’ (default: true), when NOT in
strict mode detail view is available, details for appointments are not displayed.

47184 Forwarding mails with cc-recipients automatically opens cc ﬁeld in mail compose
On model creation data from the original mail was propagated that should have been omitted.
This has been ﬁxed by omitting original mail data, now the cc ﬁled is not open automatically.

47378 Contact csv import: error message very vague
The csv parser is conﬁgured to be tolerant and accepts rows in csv ﬁles with columns sizes lower
than the number of title columns.
If a row does not contain enough columns it will add empty
columns at the end of the row. If a column in the middle of the row is missing all other entries will
be shifted to the left. This leads to an error for the distribution list column, because the importer
uses the data of another column for this ﬁeld.
This has been ﬁxed by adding a new parameter ”line number” to the response result entry in case
of an error, because it’s impossible to improve the handling of defective csv ﬁles.

47664 Empty object permission table causes stale RDBMS connections
A database connection was not returned to the pool under speciﬁc circumstances.
This has been solved by ensuring database connection is returned to pool.

47683 Mail is not displayed correctly (2 instead of three attachments)
The regex pattern to identify the uuencoding wasn’t able to handle umlauts.
This has been ﬁxed by improving the regex pattern to recognize umlauts.

47932 No free mailstore found causes conﬁgdb inconsitencies
When deploying a new cluster, having not yet registered a mailstore, creating a context caused in-
consitencies in the conﬁgdb.
This has been solved by running delete method of all registered plugins in case of a failure in
postCreate of any of the registered plugins.

48006 IMAP ID is sent after login instead of before
”ID” command gets issued after login happened, breaking Dovecot’s session tracing.
This has been ﬁxed by moving signaling IMAP session identiﬁer through ”ID” command to pre-login
state.

48047 Random OOM during parsing mail
This was caused by excessive creation of (sub-)strings while trying to re-parse a weird, but possible
start tag segment.
This has been ﬁxed by improving detection of possibly contained HTML start tag and changed re-
parse routine to avoid sub-string creation where possible.

48073 Hover on mail folders is missing after update to 7.8.2
No hover message reporting the total messages and unread messages in email folder.
The missing title is added again is now visible on hovering.

48118 Upsell I-Frame does not open in Firefox and IE
Click delegate on premium container didn’t worked as expecting.
This has been solved by using default select handler and call upsell method via custom trigger.

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully veriﬁed, are marked as such.

To avoid side eﬀects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server setup for system and integration
testing.

All changes have been checked for potential side-eﬀects and eﬀect on behavior. Unless explicitly

stated within this document, we do not expect any side-eﬀects.
