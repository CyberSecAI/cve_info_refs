## Description

xbcrypt in Percona XtraBackup before 2.3.6 and 2.4.x before 2.4.5 does not properly set the initialization vector (IV) for encryption, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from encrypted backup files via a Chosen-Plaintext attack. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2013-6394](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f2mj-h98v-gmcf "CVE-2013-6394").

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Bug Description

Currently a fixed IV (constant string) is used while encrypting the data. This

opens the encrypted stream/data to plaintext attacks among

others.

Also, we use a CTR mode - GCRY\_CIPHER\_MODE\_CTR - which has

stringent requirements on its IV - <http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1849/why-not-use-ctr-with-a-randomized-iv>

So, we should either use CBC with a random IV (but its encryption

is not parallelizable, only decryption is) or CTR with a strong

IV.

Even just CTR with a random IV should be fine since - " With counter

mode, the rule is that you cannot reuse the same IV with the same key.

However, it is perfectly fine to use the same IV with different keys"

So, assuming we generate a random IV we should add either

a) Have it provided as a parameter in the stream (so other side

knows to decrypt it).

b) Without stream, put it in one of xtrabackup metadata files to

decrypt later.

This won't be required. The salt needs to be prepended (separated

by a delimiter) to the

encrypted stream/text (in case of text, in the beginning of the

file). This convention is used elsewhere as well - crypt(3),

openssh etc.

Sergei, thanks for the report. While researching for another feature we discovered the libgcrypt already has randomization functions built in for generating proper IVs and were already planning an changing over to those calls instead.

Blueprint checksum-unencrypted-chunk

[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+spec/checksum-unencrypted-chunk]

This patch changes xbcrypt format as following:

1. Bump XBCRYPT header version number, current is "XBCRYP03"
2. Append 32-byte SHA256 hash of the plaintext to the payload of each

   chunk
3. Encrypt plaintext payload and hash all together
4. Both original length and encrypted length fields of the chunk header

   are calculated including these extra 32 bytes.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Can we not rely on the GCRYPT\_VERSION\_NUMBER to be always available and shouldn't we error out if this is not available ? (I presume this is likely to be backwards compatibility)

Also why do we require the version to be less than `0x010600` (67072)?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Correct. I added this check for compatibility. Older libgrypt versions required to use

```
GCRY_THREAD_OPTION_PTHREAD_IMPL;

```

and

```
gcry_control(GCRYCTL_SET_THREAD_CBS, &gcry_threads_pthread);

```

to work correctly in multithreaded environment. This code no longer needed and deprecated since libgrypt 1.6. Compiler gives warnings for this code. Unfortunately I cannot just remove it, because we support CentOS 5 and 6. Version number is declared in the `gcrypt.h` as follows:

```
/* The version of this header should match the one of the library. It
   should not be used by a program because gcry_check_version() should
   return the same version.  The purpose of this macro is to let
   autoconf (using the AM_PATH_GCRYPT macro) check that this header
   matches the installed library.  */
#define GCRYPT_VERSION "1.7.3"

/* The version number of this header.  It may be used to handle minor

```

0x010703 is 1.7.3. So, hexadecimal number in fact should be read as decimal. Ask libgrcypt maintainers why :)

May want to add some comments in here that we want to force an error to write to `stderr` then `abort()` the process where the length of the hash `XB_CRYPT_HASH` does not match the expected length `XB_CRYPT_HASH` please correct me if I am wrong at all here, it's been a long time since I looked at C/C++

I defined `XB_CRYPT_HASH_LEN` manually. It *must* match the length of the output given by chosen hash function (`XB_CRYPT_HASH`). I use it for buffer allocations and so on. This assert helps to ensure that if I change the hash function (`XB_CRYPT_HASH`), I also change `XB_CRYPT_HASH_LEN` and avoid buffer overflow errors. It helps to keep the code maintainable.

Yes I understand that, I just meant that a source code comment would have been appreciated here e.g.

```
#Ensure the returned value of gcry_md_get_algo_dlen(XB_CRYPT_HASH) is equal to XB_CRYPT_HASH_LEN or throw an assertion.
assert(gcry_md_get_algo_dlen(XB_CRYPT_HASH) ==
               XB_CRYPT_HASH_LEN);
```

Entirely depends on your coding standard though, so feel free to not include something like this.

thd->to char\* pointer containing `my_malloc(XB_CRYPT_CHUNK_SIZE + XB_CRYPT_HASH_LEN, MYF(MY_FAE))`

thd->from contains `(const char *) buf` presumable this is the plaintext ?

thd->from\_len contains `chunk_len = (len > XB_CRYPT_CHUNK_SIZE) ? XB_CRYPT_CHUNK_SIZE : len;`

So this confirms we are running a memcpy to memory of the plaintext right before it is encrypted ?

There's no routine I can see to run GC so we're not purging memory after completion of the backup process ? this could lead to artifacts which contain the unencrypted content.

this is an interesting part actually. I want to encrypt buffer pointed by `thd->from` and its hash and put the result into `thd->to`. I have two options:

1. allocate `hash_buffer`, put hash there, then invoke `gcry_cipher_encrypt(thd->from, thd->to); gcry_cipher_encrypt(hash_buffer, thd->to + thd->from_len)`. I.e. encrypt the buffer and the hash separately (it is streaming mode, so we are good) and put the result into the `thd->to`.
2. copy `thd->from` into `thd->to`, append hash to `thd->to`, encrypt entire chunk with single `gcry_cipher_encrypt(thd->to, thd->to)`. Libgrypt can work with the buffer inplace.

The caveat is that option 1 doesn't work for me in multithreaded environments in CentOS 5 and 6 (sigh), so I went with option 2.

As for plaintext chunks left over in the memory... Yes, we don't scrape the buffer, but it will be overwritten with the next chunk, and so on. At the moment when `xtrabackup` exists, all its memory will be given back to the system and it's kernels trouble to fill them with random garbage if needed. Isn't it?

Disclaimer is I may be wrong here, but C/C++ does not have any Garbage Collection as I noted above, the Linux Kernel does not (be default) run any GC / Purge against free memory.

You are literally waiting for a process to come along and overwrite the same address in memory, or the system is shutdown (must be powered off) and allowed to cold boot after some time (even then this doesn't address physical memory artifacts).

Perhaps I am overthinking this, however I think that right after we are done with this buffer writing an equivalent length of random data would ensure the artifact is removed.

Sometime the key copies in memory are overwritten once they are not used anymore (<http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/74280/would-it-be-good-secure-programming-practice-to-overwrite-a-sensitive-variable> etc). If you choose to do so, make sure not to use memset which can be optimized away (memset\_s if available is OK)

It probably makes sense to wipe out buffers for long living processes when keys or data are no longer used may still reside in processes memory and even be accessible to remote attacker via buffer overflow or other potential bugs.

I think xtrabackup is not the case. Encryption thread working as follows:

1. Copy plaintext from `thd->from` to `thd->to` (`thd->from` is not

   needed anymore it will be reused to read the next chunk of

   plaintext)
2. Append hash to `thd->to`
3. Encrypt `thd->to` in place

Yes, 16 kbytes of plaintext are left in the `thd->from` and we don't

erase it (actually the whole 1M of plaintext can be read into memory

at once and we process it in 16k chunks). We also keep secret key in

memory for the entire life of `xtrabackup` process. I don't think it

is an issue because:

* we reuse the same buffer to read the next chunk of plaintext

  immediately after we wrote down encrypted data
* if the chunk was the last one, `xtrabackup` is going to exit.

  `xtrabackup` is a simple tool, it exits once copying is done.
* after `xtrabackup` exited, its memory goes back to Linux kernel.

  Linux zeroes the memory before giving it to another process.

Lets say attacker has an access to `xtrabackup` memory. `xtrabackup`

isn't available via network, so attacker likely already has an access

to the filesystem. Then he will just read the data from the

filesystem, it is much easier option for him.

Am I missing something here?

we only run the encryption where it is not set to the algorithm `GCRY_CIPHER_NONE` can we think of any conditions where this may occur ? (not a priority to do this, just for my curiosity and education on PXB)

Possible values for `encrypt-algo` option are "NONE", "AES128", "AES192" and "AES256". It is user settable. One could run `xtrabackup --backup --encrypt --encrypt-algo=NONE` and get the unencrypted output. The only use case I can imagine for it is debugging.

# CVE-2016-6225: xbcrypt/xtrabackup encryption is not setting the IV correctly

Bug #1643949 reported by

### Bug Description

xbcrypt is not setting the IV correctly (and thus is not using an IV)

This causes the same ciphertext to be generated across different runs (for the

same message/same key). The IV provides the extra randomness to ensure

that the same ciphertext is not generated across runs

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-6225 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6225)

#### Description

xbcrypt in Percona XtraBackup before 2.3.6 and 2.4.x before 2.4.5 does not properly set the initialization vector (IV) for encryption, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from encrypted backup files via a Chosen-Plaintext attack. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-6394.

### Sprints

### Whiteboard

See <https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-173>

When incorrect encryption key specified we should fail with proper error message.

When we are trying to decrypt earlier encrypted backup, we should still keep unencrypted files.

When we are able to verify that files decrypted successfully we should delete encrypted file.

## [SlamData](http://slamdata.com/)

SlamData is the leading provider of post relational analytics. Modern applications including IoT, social media and SaaS often create and store data in non-relational formats, including JSON, XML, or CSV. These formats do not fit easily into a relational data structure required for querying with existing analytics and BI tools. This forces organizations to build complex ETL processes or spend weeks attempting to wrangle the data. SlamData is the only solution that works natively against any data regardless of degree of structure. The open source solution allows users to explore, query and visualize complex data without any ETL or mapping, ever. User can easily embed reports and build interactive dashboards that reflect live data stored in MongoDB. SlamData powers analytics and reporting solutions for Fortune 500 companies, startups and government agencies. It’s the go-to tool for software developers, data scientists, business intelligence professionals, product managers and more.

### Bug Description

Currently a fixed IV (constant string) is used while encrypting the data. This

opens the encrypted stream/data to plaintext attacks among

others.

Also, we use a CTR mode - GCRY\_CIPHER\_MODE\_CTR - which has

stringent requirements on its IV - <http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1849/why-not-use-ctr-with-a-randomized-iv>

So, we should either use CBC with a random IV (but its encryption

is not parallelizable, only decryption is) or CTR with a strong

IV.

Even just CTR with a random IV should be fine since - " With counter

mode, the rule is that you cannot reuse the same IV with the same key.

However, it is perfectly fine to use the same IV with different keys"

So, assuming we generate a random IV we should add either

a) Have it provided as a parameter in the stream (so other side

knows to decrypt it).

b) Without stream, put it in one of xtrabackup metadata files to

decrypt later.

This won't be required. The salt needs to be prepended (separated

by a delimiter) to the

encrypted stream/text (in case of text, in the beginning of the

file). This convention is used elsewhere as well - crypt(3),

openssh etc.

Sergei, thanks for the report. While researching for another feature we discovered the libgcrypt already has randomization functions built in for generating proper IVs and were already planning an changing over to those calls instead.

# CVE-2016-6225: Percona Xtrabackup Encryption IV Not Being Set Properly

January 12, 2017

[David Busby](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby) and [Kenny Gryp](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/gryp)

[![CVE-2016-6225](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/07/08/percona-xtrabackup-2-3-5-is-now-available/percona_xtrabackuplogovert_cmyk/)If you are using [Percona XtraBackup](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup) with  [xbcrypt](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/xbcrypt/xbcrypt.html) to create [encrypted backups](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/innobackupex/encrypted_backups_innobackupex.html), and are using versions older than 2.3.6 or 2.4.5, we advise that you upgrade Percona XtraBackup.

Note: this does **not** **affect** encryption of [encrypted InnoDB tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-tablespace-encryption.html).

#### CVE-2016-6225

Percona XtraBackup versions older than 2.3.6 or 2.4.5 suffered an issue of not properly setting the Initialization Vector (IV) for encryption. This could allow someone to carry out a [Chosen-Plaintext Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack), which could recover decrypted content from the encrypted backup files without the need for a password.

#### Compatibility

Percona XtraBackup carries backward compatibility to allow for the decryption of older backup files. However, encrypted backup files produced by the versions that have the fix will not be compatible with older versions of Percona XtraBackup.

#### Applicability

Access to the encrypted files must already be present for exploitation to occur. So long as you adequately protect the encrypted files, we don’t expect this issue to adversely affect users.

#### Credits

Percona would like to thank and give credit to Ken Takara for discovering this issue and working it through to PoC exploitation.

#### More Information

* [CVE-2016-6225](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6225)
* We originally note the issue in [https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+bug/1185343](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/%2Bbug/1185343) ([CVE-2013-6394](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6394)) and marked it as addressed in [Percona XtraBackup 2.1.6 Release Notes](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.1/release-notes/2.1/2.1.6.html). This did not completely fix the issue, however. We are confident it has now been fully addressed.
* The 2016 bug report for this can be found here:[https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+bug/1643949](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/%2Bbug/1643949)

#### Release Notes

* 2.3 Series: <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.3/release-notes/2.3/2.3.6.html>
* 2.4 Series: [https:](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/release-notes/2.4/2.4.5.html)[//www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/release-notes/2.4/2.4.5.html](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/release-notes/2.4/2.4.5.html)

# CVE-2016-6225: Percona Xtrabackup Encryption IV Not Being Set Properly

January 12, 2017

[David Busby](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby) and [Kenny Gryp](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/gryp)

[![CVE-2016-6225](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/07/08/percona-xtrabackup-2-3-5-is-now-available/percona_xtrabackuplogovert_cmyk/)If you are using [Percona XtraBackup](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup) with  [xbcrypt](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/xbcrypt/xbcrypt.html) to create [encrypted backups](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/innobackupex/encrypted_backups_innobackupex.html), and are using versions older than 2.3.6 or 2.4.5, we advise that you upgrade Percona XtraBackup.

Note: this does **not** **affect** encryption of [encrypted InnoDB tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-tablespace-encryption.html).

#### CVE-2016-6225

Percona XtraBackup versions older than 2.3.6 or 2.4.5 suffered an issue of not properly setting the Initialization Vector (IV) for encryption. This could allow someone to carry out a [Chosen-Plaintext Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack), which could recover decrypted content from the encrypted backup files without the need for a password.

#### Compatibility

Percona XtraBackup carries backward compatibility to allow for the decryption of older backup files. However, encrypted backup files produced by the versions that have the fix will not be compatible with older versions of Percona XtraBackup.

#### Applicability

Access to the encrypted files must already be present for exploitation to occur. So long as you adequately protect the encrypted files, we don’t expect this issue to adversely affect users.

#### Credits

Percona would like to thank and give credit to Ken Takara for discovering this issue and working it through to PoC exploitation.

We have had to revert back to TLSv1.0. If you saw my previous post on TLSv1.0 (https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/05/23/percona-disabling-tlsv1-0-may-31st-2016/), you’ll know I  wanted to deprecate TLSv1.0 well ahead of PCI’s changes. We made the changes May 31st. Unfortunately, it has become apparent that EL 5, which is in the final phases of End Of Life, does not support TLSv1.1 […]

# CVE-2016-6225

| **Name** | CVE-2016-6225 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | xbcrypt in Percona XtraBackup before 2.3.6 and 2.4.x before 2.4.5 does not properly set the initialization vector (IV) for encryption, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from encrypted backup files via a Chosen-Plaintext attack. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-6394. |

# Percona Careers

Live and work from anywhere!

[Find your next role](#get-started)

### Remote by Design

Since its founding in 2006, Percona has always been a remote company. The reason? It’s a tech company that knows how to use technology effectively and doesn’t want to have geography limit its talent pool, said CEO Ann Schlemmer.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

We have a high degree of trust with our staff. Leaders aren’t checking to see what time workers log in each day or moni toring if their light on Slack is green. You can’t have that sort of behavior and have an effective remote company. I have pride in how we live our values. That’s one of our values: We don’t care where you’re located... If someone is a digital nomad and that’s their lifestyle and that makes them happiest, I think that brings productivity. The goal is for employees to get their work done and then just enjoy life.”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Ann Schlemmer**
CEO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Every day at Percona, I am fortunate to collaborate with exceptional colleagues across every department, creating an environment where expertise is all around us. Our collective excellence is not only a daily inspiration, but it also raises the performance bar for everyone. I am truly grateful to be a part of a culture where our commitment to core values is palpable, driving our unwavering dedication to delivering for our customers, community, and colleagues. We rarely have a boring day here at Percona!”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Bennie Grant**
COO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

What keeps me excited every day is Percona's unique culture and remote-only approach. It provides me with daily opportunities to collaborate with colleagues from all over the world, which enriches my work experience. We push boundaries, offer flexibility, and create a dynamic environment that fosters innovation and finding a better way. Percona is more than just a workplace; it is a global community of passionate experts, making it a great place to work.”

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1019858#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2017-01-13 12:44:41 UTC  ``` <https://www.percona.com/blog/2017/01/12/cve-2016-6225-percona-xtrabackup-encryption-iv-not-set-properly/>  Percona XtraBackup versions older than 2.3.6 or 2.4.5 suffered an issue of not properly setting the Initialization Vector (IV) for encryption. This could allow someone to carry out a Chosen-Plaintext Attack, which could recover decrypted content from the encrypted backup files without the need for a password. Compatibility  Percona XtraBackup carries backward compatibility to allow for the decryption of older backup files. However, encrypted backup files produced by the versions that have the fix will not be compatible with older versions of Percona XtraBackup.  Applicability: Access to the encrypted files must already be present for exploitation to occur. So long as you adequately protect the encrypted files, we don’t expect this issue to adversely affect users. Credits  Percona would like to thank and give credit to Ken Takara for discovering this issue and working it through to PoC exploitation.  More Information:   CVE-2016-6225 We originally note the issue in [https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+bug/1185343](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/%2Bbug/1185343) (CVE-2013-6394) and marked it as addressed in Percona XtraBackup 2.1.6 Release Notes. This did not completely fix the issue, however. We are confident it has now been fully addressed.
