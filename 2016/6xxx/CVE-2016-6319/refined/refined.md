{
  "CVE-2016-6319": {
    "Description": "The Foreman Remote Execution plugin is vulnerable to a stored XSS via a job template with a malformed name. An attacker with privileges to set the name in a template can inject arbitrary HTML including scripting code within the web interface, which gets executed when someone tries to invoke the job. This is because the form is generated based on the name without proper escaping.",
    "Root cause": "Improper input sanitization/escaping of user-provided names used in job templates within the Foreman Remote Execution plugin.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient output sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a job template or invokes a job with a malicious name. The attacker needs to have privileges to create or edit job templates to set the name containing malicious HTML.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit job templates in Foreman. This typically requires a user account with sufficient permissions."
