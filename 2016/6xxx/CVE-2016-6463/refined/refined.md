Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the email filtering functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances. Specifically, a flaw in how the software processes MIME headers allows a bypass of Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) filters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The software does not properly validate or sanitize malformed MIME headers, which leads to the bypass of security filters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Bypass:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass AMP filters, which are designed to scan incoming email attachments for malware. This means that malicious attachments, which would normally be detected, can pass through undetected.
*   **Malware Delivery:** Attackers can potentially deliver malware to end-users by attaching malicious files in emails that would normally be flagged by the AMP feature.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack can be carried out by an unauthenticated, remote attacker.
*   **Email:** The attack vector is through email, specifically by sending emails with specially crafted MIME headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a target that is protected by a vulnerable Cisco Email Security Appliance with AMP enabled.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft emails with malformed MIME headers that can bypass the filtering.
*   No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (both virtual and hardware versions).
*   The Cisco Content Security Management Appliance and Cisco Web Security Appliance are confirmed to NOT be affected.
*   The provided CVSS score is Base 5.0 and Temporal 4.1, which indicates a medium severity vulnerability that can be exploited remotely with low complexity.
*   The vulnerability is identified by Cisco Bug ID CSCuz85823 and CVE-2016-6463
