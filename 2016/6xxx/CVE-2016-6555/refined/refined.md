Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-6555:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of data received via SNMP before being stored and displayed in the OpenNMS web application. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are injected and then executed when a user views the affected pages. Two attack vectors were identified:
    *   **SNMP Trap Alerts:**  Malicious payloads are injected via SNMP traps.
    *   **SNMP Agent Data:** Malicious payloads are injected through data collected from SNMP agents during discovery scans.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected code can access the authenticated user's cookies and perform privileged operations within the web application, potentially leading to complete account compromise.
*   **Further Attacks:** The XSS can be a stepping stone for more complex attacks, such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious SNMP Traps:** An attacker sends a crafted SNMP trap containing the XSS payload within the trap's variables. The `Trapd` service processes traps with any SNMP v1 or v2c community string. The system is vulnerable to traps from both known and unknown hosts.
*   **Malicious SNMP Agent:** A rogue node with a compromised or attacker-controlled SNMP agent provides the XSS payload in response to SNMP GetRequest messages. Specifically the `sysName` (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5) and `sysContact` (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4) OIDs are exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SNMP traps to the OpenNMS server or have control over a device that can be discovered and monitored by OpenNMS via SNMP.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing prior authentication to the OpenNMS system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matthew Kienow and reported by Rapid7.
*   The specific vulnerable versions of OpenNMS are 18.0.0 and 18.0.1.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 18.0.2-1 of OpenNMS, released on September 20, 2016.
*   The fix involved sanitizing input to prevent the execution of injected script tags via WebSecurityUtils.sanitizeString().
*   The specific XSS payloads used for testing were:
    *   SNMP Trap: `<IMG SRC=/ onerror="alert('SNMP Trap Test')"></IMG>`
    *   SNMP Agent (sysName): `<script>alert("sysNameTest");</script>`
    *   SNMP Agent (sysContact): `<IMG SRC=/ onerror=alert(/sysContactTest/) />`
