    "additional_information": "The provided exploit code demonstrates a method to achieve remote code execution by leveraging a use-after-free vulnerability in the WebView component. It uses Javascript to manipulate the memory layout and inject shellcode, effectively taking over the process.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted webpage. The exploit performs heap spraying to allocate memory, which is then corrupted through the use-after-free. The shellcode is then written into the memory, and function pointers are manipulated to execute it."
