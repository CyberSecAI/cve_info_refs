Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6882:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of RSA signatures generated using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) optimization within the MatrixSSL library. A fault during the computation of an RSA signature with CRT can lead to the exposure of the private key if the signature is not verified before being sent. This is known as a Lenstra's attack.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is that the MatrixSSL implementation did not include a post-signing verification step to ensure the correctness of RSA signatures generated via CRT. The RSA-CRT optimization computes the signature in two parts, modulo p and q of the modulus n. If a fault occurs during only one of the component calculations, this can allow the attacker to derive the private key.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker, observing a faulty signature, can recover the RSA private key by calculating the greatest common divisor of `(ye - x, n)`. This enables impersonation of the server, decryption of past TLS sessions if forward secrecy is not used, and the performance of man-in-the-middle attacks.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack is possible when the server supports DHE_RSA based cipher suites, as this is where RSA signatures are sent in the SERVER_KEY_EXCHANGE message.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered if a fault occurs during the RSA signature generation when using the CRT optimization.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to observe the faulty signature sent during the TLS handshake.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be in a position to observe TLS handshakes (passive observer).
    *   The attacker needs to identify a faulty RSA signature.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the original value which was signed to compute the gcd.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Fix:** The fix involves adding an internal RSA signature validation step in the `psRsaEncryptPriv()` function. This validation will cause the TLS handshake to fail before a faulty signature can be sent, preventing key exposure. This is implemented in MatrixSSL 3.8.3.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document details a broader issue related to RSA-CRT implementation vulnerabilities and how forward secrecy in TLS exposes them. The document discusses other implementations that are vulnerable to the same issue and provides a detailed explanation of Lenstra's attack.
* The document also describes how to detect the faulty signatures, different reasons why the key recovery might fail, and an example of a patch for OpenSSL to inject the fault.
*   The CVE assignment is specifically for the MatrixSSL vulnerability but is part of a broader effort to address RSA-CRT hardening issues across multiple implementations.
*   The vulnerability is not in the RSA algorithm itself, but rather in how it's implemented with CRT optimization.
