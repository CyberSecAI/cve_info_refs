    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-476",
      "Description": "There is a bug occur in exif_process_user_comment when trying to encode JIS string. At PHP_INI_BEGIN, encode_jis was set at empty string so that the result of call zend_multibyte_fetch_encoding(ImageInfo->encode_jis) returns NULL and then pass to zend_multibyte_encoding_converter. If this php version is compiled with mbstring, this NULL pointer is passed to mbfl_buffer_converter_new2 through to pointer. Because of none checking 2 pointers from and to so NULL pointer is passed directly to convd->to and result is the crash when calling mbfl_convert_filter_get_vtbl.",
      "Assigner": "cve-assign@mitre.org",
      "Date": "2016-07-25"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The root cause is a NULL pointer dereference in the `mbfl_buffer_converter_new2` function due to a lack of validation on the input encoding provided to the `zend_multibyte_encoding_converter` function. The `zend_multibyte_fetch_encoding` function returns NULL when an empty encoding is specified, leading to a NULL pointer being passed.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "NULL Pointer Dereference",
        "Lack of Input Validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault or crash when processing a crafted image file with an EXIF user comment containing a specific JIS encoding.",
      "Attack vector": "The attack vector is through processing a crafted JPEG image file, which includes a specially crafted EXIF user comment containing a JIS encoding.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to have a target PHP application process the malicious image file. No special capabilities or specific location is needed, any user which can upload files can trigger this."
