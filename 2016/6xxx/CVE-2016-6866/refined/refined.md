Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6866:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL pointer check on the return value of the `crypt()` function in the `slock` screen locker application. Specifically, when `crypt()` is called with an invalid password hash (e.g., when a user's password is not set or the account is disabled), it returns `NULL`. The `slock` application doesn't verify if the return value is NULL before passing it to `strcmp()`, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and a subsequent segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The primary vulnerability is the dereference of a NULL pointer. This occurs when `crypt()` returns `NULL` and the result is directly used in `strcmp()`
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of the `crypt()` function's output, failing to handle the case where it returns `NULL`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Screen Unlock:** When the `slock` application crashes due to the NULL pointer dereference, the locked X session becomes unlocked, leaving the system accessible without requiring the correct password. This effectively bypasses the screen lock mechanism and could allow unauthorized access.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash also results in a denial-of-service condition for the screen locking functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through user accounts with invalid password hashes. This can occur when:
    - A user's account has not been assigned a password.
    - The user's account is disabled (e.g. due to expiry or other reasons).
    - The system uses NSS for authentication where `getspnam()->sp_pwdp` returns "*".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not necessarily need to be an external party.
- The primary requirement is that the user's account has an invalid hash, which causes the `crypt()` to return NULL.
- An attacker with local access could trigger the vulnerability by setting an invalid hash, which could result in the `slock` application crashing and unlocking the system.
- There are no explicit requirements for the attacker to have elevated privileges or specific positions within the system. However, the attacker needs some level of access to trigger a locked screen or, more indirectly, needs to influence or know about an account's disabled status or lack of password.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in all versions of `slock` prior to the fix.
- The fix involves checking if `crypt()` returns `NULL` and handling the error case gracefully.
- The patch also includes a check to make sure that the password hash from the system is at least 2 bytes long
- The `slock` binary has `setgid` set which makes it more concerning if a user could control the `USER` variable.
