Subject: [CVE-2016-6317] Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Active Record

# Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Active Record

There is a vulnerability when Active Record is used in conjunction with JSON
parameter parsing. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2016-6317.  This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694
and CVE-2013-0155.

Versions Affected:  >= 4.2.0
Not affected:       < 4.2.0, >= 5.0.0
Fixed Versions:     4.2.7.1

Impact
------

Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue unexpected database queries with "IS NULL" or empty where clauses.  This issue does *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however they can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when most users wouldn't expect it.

For example, a system has password reset with token functionality:

    unless params[:token].nil?
      user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])
      user.reset_password!
    end

An attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will return `[nil]`.  The `[nil]` value will bypass the test for nil, but will still add an "IN ('xyz', NULL)" clause to the SQL query.

Similarly, an attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will return an empty hash.  An empty hash will eliminate the WHERE clause of the query, but can bypass the `nil?` check.

Note that this impacts not only dynamic finders (`find_by_*`) but also relations (`User.where(:name => params[:name])`).

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately. All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately. Please note, this vulnerability is a variant of CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694, and CVE-2013-0155.  Even if you upgraded to address those issues, you must take action again.

If this chance in behavior impacts your application, you can manually decode the original values from the request like so:

    ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(request.body)

Releases
--------
The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
This problem can be mitigated by casting the parameter to a string before passing it to Active Record.  For example:

    unless params[:token].nil? || params[:token].to_s.empty?
      user = User.find_by_token(params[:token].to_s)
      user.reset_password!
    end

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 4-2-unsafe-query-generation.patch - Patch for 4.2 series

Please note that only the 5.0.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users
of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we
cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported
releases.

Credits

Thanks to joernchen of Phenoelit for reporting this!

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1365017#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-08 11:20:35 UTC  ``` The following flaw was found in Active Record:  Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue unexpected database queries with "IS NULL" or empty where clauses. This issue does *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however they can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when most users wouldn't expect it.  This issue only affects the 4.2.x versions of Active Record.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1365017#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-08 11:20:43 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Ruby on Rails project Upstream: joernchen (Phenoelit)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1365017#c3)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-08 11:21:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1188641](attachment.cgi?id=1188641 "4-2-unsafe-query-generation.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1188641&action=edit "4-2-unsafe-query-generation.patch") 4-2-unsafe-query-generation.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1365017#c4)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-12 06:00:07 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-activerecord tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1366479](show_bug.cgi?id=1366479 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6317 rubygem-activerecord: unsafe query generation in Active Record [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1365017#c5)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-12 06:00:59 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyonrails-security/rgO20zYW33s/gmamLa-wDAAJ>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1365017#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2016-08-12 20:08:04 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  4.2: <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/93ab8c2638a5a3aa3e63915a4c646effefbae0ba>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1365017#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-09-13 11:12:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS  Via RHSA-2016:1855 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1855.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

An update for rh-ror42-rubygem-actionview, rh-ror42-rubygem-activerecord, and rh-ror42-rubygem-actionpack is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development. Action View implements the view component, and Active Record implements the model component.

Security Fix(es) in rubygem-actionview:

* It was discovered that Action View tag helpers did not escape quotes when using strings declared as HTML safe as attribute values. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. (CVE-2016-6316)

Security Fix(es) in rubygem-activerecord:

* A flaw was found in the way Active Record handled certain special values in dynamic finders and relations. If a Ruby on Rails application performed JSON parameter parsing, a remote attacker could possibly manipulate search conditions in SQL queries generated by the application. (CVE-2016-6317)

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Andrew Carpenter (Critical Juncture) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6316; and joernchen (Phenoelit) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6317.
