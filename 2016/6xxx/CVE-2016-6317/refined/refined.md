Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Active Record interprets parameters, particularly when combined with JSON parameter parsing. Active Record does not properly handle `nil` values and empty hashes when they are part of a JSON parameter, leading to unexpected database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsafe Query Generation:**  Attackers can manipulate JSON parameters to generate SQL queries with "IS NULL" clauses or without WHERE clauses. This occurs because when `nil` or an empty hash is provided as input, they bypass nil checks, but are interpreted in a way that generates an unintended query.
- **Bypassing Nil Checks:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass `nil` checks by crafting a request where a parameter returns `[nil]` or an empty hash, which are not considered `nil` by the conditional check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unexpected Database Queries:** An attacker can cause the application to execute SQL queries that search for NULL values or omit WHERE clauses, potentially leading to information disclosure or other unintended behavior. For example, a `find_by_token` query could be manipulated to return all users if the `WHERE` clause is eliminated or to search for users with a `NULL` token, when that's not intended.
- **Potential Information Disclosure**: If a user database is accessed without the proper parameters, then an attacker could potentially disclose unintended user data.
- **Bypass of Application Logic:** Attackers can bypass application logic designed to check for the presence of parameters, as demonstrated by the example of password reset using a token.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **JSON Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers craft malicious JSON requests that inject `nil` values or empty hashes as parameters that are processed by Active Record.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through sending HTTP requests with specially crafted JSON parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any special privileges on the server.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of JSON Parsing:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the application parses JSON parameters and how Active Record interprets these parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is a variant of previously reported issues: CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694, and CVE-2013-0155.
- The vulnerability affects Rails versions 4.2.0 and above, but is fixed in version 4.2.7.1 and is not present in versions before 4.2.0 or after 5.0.0.
- The provided fix involves casting the parameter to a string before passing it to Active Record.
- The vulnerability is in the Ruby gem `activerecord`.
