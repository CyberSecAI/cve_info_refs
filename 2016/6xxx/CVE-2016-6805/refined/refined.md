The provided content is related to CVE-2016-6805.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in Apache Ignite's update notifier component. The component communicates with an external PHP server over HTTP. The response from this server is parsed as XML, creating an opportunity for an XXE attack. Additionally, the component sends sensitive system properties over HTTP by mistake, which could include installation folders or environment variables stored in Java system properties.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XXE injection vulnerability in the XML parser.
- Transmitting sensitive data over insecure HTTP protocol.
- Lack of TLS for communication between the application and the PHP server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform arbitrary file reads by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.
- A Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack is possible because TLS is not used, allowing an attacker to modify the response from the external server.

**Attack vectors:**
- MitM attack to alter the response from the update server, triggering the XXE vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform a MitM attack to intercept and modify the response from the external PHP server.
- A vulnerable instance of Apache Ignite, versions 1.0.0-RC3 to 1.8, must be running with the update notifier enabled.
