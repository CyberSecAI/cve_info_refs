Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Wireless Session Protocol (WSP) dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, a malformed packet could cause the `add_headers()` function in `packet_wsp.c` to enter an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The WSP dissector's logic for handling certain malformed packets can lead to an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By injecting a malformed packet, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, effectively leading to a denial of service. This can make Wireshark unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Packets on the Wire:** An attacker can inject a specially crafted, malformed WSP packet onto the network.
- **Malformed Capture Files:** An attacker can convince a user to open a malicious packet capture file that contains the malformed WSP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject network packets (e.g., on a shared network) or needs to convince a user to open a malicious capture file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Chris Benedict, Aurelien Delaitre, and the NIST SAMATE Project.
- The affected versions are Wireshark 2.0.0 to 2.0.4 and 1.12.0 to 1.12.12.
- The issue is fixed in Wireshark versions 2.0.5 and 1.12.13.
- The vulnerability was assigned the identifier `wnpa-sec-2016-42`.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3648-1 addresses this along with other Wireshark vulnerabilities.
