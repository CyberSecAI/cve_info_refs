Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-6433:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Cisco Firepower Threat Management Console has a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary system commands by uploading a malicious file. The vulnerability exists because the webserver runs as a non-root user that is permitted to execute sudo commands as root without a password. The system uses a shell script to perform IDS rule updates, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into the script during upload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** The system does not properly validate the type of uploaded file, allowing the upload of a shell script containing malicious commands.
- **CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code:** The system executes the uploaded file, which contains attacker-controlled code, allowing arbitrary command execution.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system does not properly sanitize or validate the contents of the uploaded file.
- **Insecure use of sudo:** The `www` user is allowed to execute the `useradd` command as root without a password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system as the root user.
- **Full System Compromise:** By executing commands as root, an attacker gains complete control over the affected system, which can lead to data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
- **Creation of Backdoor Accounts:** The attacker can create new user accounts with root privileges, facilitating future access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/DetectionPolicy/rules/rulesimport.cgi` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the Cisco Firepower Management Console web interface. The vulnerability is not directly exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the management interface of the vulnerable device.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint (`/DetectionPolicy/rules/rulesimport.cgi`) to send the malicious request.
