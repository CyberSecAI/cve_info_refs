{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient checks when adding shortcuts, where any app can add a shortcut using the INSTALL_SHORTCUT permission (a normal level permission). The launcher app then launches the intent, which may have other permissions. This allows a malicious app to bypass the permission check by adding a shortcut with an intent requiring sensitive permissions.  Specifically, when adding a shortcut from a broadcast or using the two-step drop process, the system failed to verify if the intent requires permission or if the source app has the permission to create such a shortcut.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of privilege. The vulnerability allows an application to create shortcuts that bypass normal permission checks, which can be used to gain access to functionalities requiring higher permissions without the userâ€™s consent.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local malicious application could create shortcuts that, when launched, execute with the elevated permissions of the launcher application. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities or data.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local application can exploit this vulnerability by creating a shortcut with an intent that requires permission from the user or an app other than the launcher. The vulnerable code is in the AOSP launcher.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a local application installed on the device. The attacker does not need any special permissions as they can create shortcuts with normal level permissions. The attack would need user interaction to launch the malicious shortcut."
