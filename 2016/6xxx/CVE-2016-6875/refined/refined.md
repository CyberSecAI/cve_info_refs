Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6875:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper recursion checks in the `wddx` extension of Facebook's HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine). Specifically, the code didn't detect infinite recursion caused by references or self-referential objects, such as closures that return themselves when converted to an array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Infinite Recursion:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for infinite recursion when serializing certain data structures using the `wddx_serialize_value` function. This occurs because the serialization logic doesn't properly track already processed objects or arrays, causing it to repeatedly process the same data, resulting in an infinite loop.
- **Missing Recursion Check:** The code lacked a mechanism to detect and prevent recursive calls when serializing self-referential data structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crafting a malicious input that triggers the infinite recursion, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) and potentially crashing the HHVM process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted PHP script containing self-referential data structures (e.g., a closure, a circular array) as input to a HHVM application that uses the `wddx_serialize_value` function.
- **Remote/Local:** The attack can be performed remotely if an application accepts and processes user-provided data with `wddx_serialize_value` or locally by executing a malicious PHP script within a vulnerable HHVM environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute PHP code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code within an environment running a vulnerable version of HHVM. This might involve uploading code to a vulnerable web application or through other means.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to know about the `wddx_serialize_value` function and how to craft input that triggers the recursion.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a check for already seen containers (arrays or objects) during serialization. This is achieved using a `SeenContainers` set that keeps track of processed data structures. If the serializer encounters an already seen container, a warning is raised, and the serialization is stopped, preventing infinite recursion.
- The fix also addresses the fact that closures return themselves when converted to an array.
