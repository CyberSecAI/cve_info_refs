    "CVE-2016-6663": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the way MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona databases perform MyISAM engine table repair. Specifically, temporary data files created during the repair process are renamed to the original .MYD file after copying stats from the old file to the new file with chmod/chown. This process is vulnerable to a race condition.",
      "weaknesses": "Race condition, unsafe file operations during table repair.",
      "impact": "A local system user with access to the affected database could escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system user (typically 'mysql'). This can lead to gaining access to all databases stored on the server and further escalate to root via other vulnerabilities. An attacker can also achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the mysql user (mysql shell) through the setting of SUID and execute permissions on a bash shell. The attacker can control the file permissions and ownership by replacing the temporary file with a symlink.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access to the database server, ability to execute CREATE/INSERT/SELECT queries and ability to trigger a table repair operation.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local shell access on the server running MySQL, write access to data directory and low-privileged database account with CREATE, INSERT, and SELECT grants, ability to replace the temporary table file with a symlink during a race condition.",
        "additional_details":"The advisory notes that setting `symbolic-links = 0` (which is used by default in all MySQL and MariaDB packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later) mitigates this issue for users without shell access. The default configuration of all MySQL and MariaDB packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later is to disable symlink support - symbolic-links=0 setting is used in the default my.cnf.  With this setting, only mysql system user should be able to exploit this flaw. The mysql packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 have symlink support enabled by default, however, Red Hat has been recommending disabling symlink support since 2010. The vulnerability can also be chained with other privilege escalation vulnerabilities discovered by the author of this advisory (CVE-2016-6662 and CVE-2016-6664) to further escalate privileges from mysql user to root user."
