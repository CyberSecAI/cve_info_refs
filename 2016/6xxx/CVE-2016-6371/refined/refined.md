Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in the web interface of the Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment (HCM-F) application. This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to locations on the file system that the application server has permissions to access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-22:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').
- The web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input related to file paths, allowing directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can write arbitrary files to any location on the file system accessible by the application server. This could allow for:
    - Overwriting existing files.
    - Creation of malicious files.
    - Potential execution of malicious code.
    - Manipulation of the system.
- The impact is described as affecting "Integrity," as it allows unauthorized modification of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be launched remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is in the web interface of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests.
- No special privileges or authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment (HCM-F) versions 10.6(3) and prior.
- **CVSS Score:** Base 5.0, Temporal 4.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C) which indicates a moderate severity.
- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available, and upgrading to a fixed version is the only solution.
- **No Public Exploits:** The Cisco PSIRT was not aware of public exploits or malicious use at the time of the advisory.
- **CVSS Vector Breakdown:**
    - AV:N (Network): Attack vector is network-based.
    - AC:L (Low): Low attack complexity.
    - Au:N (None): No authentication required.
    - C:N (None): No impact on confidentiality.
    - I:P (Partial): Partial impact on integrity (ability to write arbitrary files).
    - A:N (None): No impact on availability.
    - E:F (Functional): Functional exploit code is available (at the time of calculation).
    - RL:U (Unavailable): No official fix available yet (at the time of calculation).
    - RC:C (Confirmed): Vulnerability is confirmed by the vendor.
