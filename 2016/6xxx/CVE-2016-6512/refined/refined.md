Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6512:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop within the MMSE, WAP, WBXML, and WSP dissectors of Wireshark. Specifically the `add_capabilities()` function in the WSP dissector is mentioned in the gitlab issue link.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is an improperly handled malformed packet within the dissectors, leading to an infinite loop. This can cause excessive CPU consumption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The excessive CPU consumption can cause Wireshark to become unresponsive and potentially crash. The Exploit-DB entry mentions excessive memory consumption ( >4GB ) as well
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by providing a malformed packet capture file to a user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic or provide a malformed packet capture file.

**Affected Software:**

*   Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.4 are vulnerable.
*   Wireshark versions 1.12.x are not vulnerable to the WSP issue, but have their own vulnerabilities.
*   Specific dissectors affected: MMSE, WAP, WBXML, and WSP.

**Resolution:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark version 2.0.5. Users should upgrade to this version or later to mitigate the risk.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a PCAP file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   The issue was discovered by Antti Levom√§ki.
*   The openwall.com content refers to multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark and requests CVE assignment for them. CVE-2016-6512 was assigned to the combination of issues in the WSP, WBXML, MMSE, and WAP dissectors.
*   The bugzilla entries in the openwall content also refer to separate vulnerabilities, which are different from this issue.
*   The wireshark security page confirms the vulnerability and resolution.
