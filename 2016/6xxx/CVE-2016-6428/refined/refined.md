Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6428:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco IOS XR Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to *root* level.
*   **Improper Authorization:** The CLI does not properly restrict command execution, allowing authenticated users with lower privileges to run arbitrary code with *root* privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Gaining root access enables the attacker to take complete control of the affected system, including modifying configurations, accessing sensitive data, and disrupting operations.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**  The vulnerability has a complete impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability as indicated by the CVSS vector (C:C/I:C/A:C).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system. This implies the attacker would already have to have compromised a non-root user account on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to log into the system with an existing user account and execute commands via the CLI.
*   The attacker must have a local presence on the device or have the ability to execute commands remotely through a compromised session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that no workarounds are available.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8 and a temporal score of 5.6
*   The advisory includes links to the Cisco Bug Search Tool for finding information on fixed software.

This detailed information goes beyond what a basic CVE description provides by detailing the access vector, required authentication, the specific software affected, and that no workarounds exist.
