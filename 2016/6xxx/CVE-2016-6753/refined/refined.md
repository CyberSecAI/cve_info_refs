{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the netfilter nfnetlink module. Specifically, when handling batch messages, there are multiple issues in validating the `nlmsg_len` field of the Netlink message header. A zero value or a value smaller than `NLMSG_HDRLEN` can lead to an infinite loop or out-of-bounds read respectively. Also, if the validation fails, the malformed message is copied back to userspace, which can result in further out-of-bounds read due to the invalid length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of message length (`nlmsg_len`)",
      "Integer underflow in the `nlmsg_len()` calculation",
      "Lack of proper error handling when a malformed message is detected",
      "Out-of-bounds read due to improper length validation",
        "Infinite loop due to pulling 0 bytes"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger an infinite loop or cause an out-of-bounds read which leads to a kernel crash and denial of service. This could also potentially lead to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted Netlink messages to the nfnetlink module.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability to trigger the vulnerability."
