Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6509:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2016-6509 is one of multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Wireshark dissectors. Specifically, it is associated with the "RLC" dissector.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the RLC dissector that can lead to a long loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Long loop: The RLC dissector can enter a long loop when processing malformed packets, consuming excessive CPU resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By triggering the long loop, an attacker can make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. This prevents Wireshark from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed packet injection: Attackers can inject malformed RLC packets onto the network.
- Malformed capture files: Attackers can create malformed PCAP trace files containing malicious RLC packets and convince a user to open them with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject network packets or provide a malicious capture file to a user. This can be done remotely if the attacker can inject packets on a network being monitored or locally by getting a user to open a malicious capture file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Wireshark versions 2.0.5 and 1.12.13.
