Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the corruption of an internal data structure during IPv4 packet reassembly.
*   This corruption is due to a memory alignment issue specific to 64-bit Cisco IOS XE platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of memory alignment within the IPv4 fragment reassembly function.
*   Corruption of an internal data structure used in the packet reassembly process.
*   Specifically, a pointer within this structure gets corrupted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload.
*   This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, interrupting network operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed remotely over a network.
*   The attacker sends specially crafted IPv4 fragments to the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the targeted device.
*   No authentication is required, meaning an unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft IPv4 fragments to trigger the memory corruption.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects specific Cisco devices running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software on a 64-bit Cisco IOS XE platform, with an IPv4 address configured on one or more interfaces.
*   Examples of vulnerable platforms include Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers, Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Routers, Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with RP2 or RP3, and Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers.
*   The advisory provides instructions on how to determine if a device is running a vulnerable 64-bit version of Cisco IOS XE Software using the `show version | i X86_64` command.
*   There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability, only software updates.
*   The advisory includes a detailed list of affected software versions (product IDs).
*   The vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.
*   The CVSS v2 score is provided as Base 7.8 and Temporal 6.4, with the vector string as  `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C`.
