```
{
  "CVE-2016-6288": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `php_url_parse_ex` function in PHP does not properly handle the length of the input URL when parsing, leading to a buffer over-read.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Buffer Over-read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault in PHP.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted URL to the affected `php_url_parse_ex` function.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to pass a malicious URL to the vulnerable PHP function. This could be achieved through user-supplied input (e.g., URL query parameters, file paths), or by other means that allow influencing how PHP processes URLs."
