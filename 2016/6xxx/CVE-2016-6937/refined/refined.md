Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader DC handles FlateDecode streams within PDF files. A specifically crafted FlateDecode stream can cause the application to read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read when processing a malicious FlateDecode stream. This occurs due to a flaw in how the stream's data is handled within the application's memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the process's memory. This can potentially expose confidential data or provide an attacker with additional information about the system.
- Arbitrary Code Execution (in conjunction with other vulnerabilities): While this vulnerability alone does not directly allow arbitrary code execution, the advisory notes that an attacker could leverage it alongside other vulnerabilities to achieve this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF File: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing a specifically designed FlateDecode stream to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- Malicious Web Page: A user can be lured to visit a malicious web page that attempts to exploit this vulnerability through crafted PDF content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious PDF file: The attacker needs the capability to create a PDF document with a specially crafted FlateDecode stream.
- User interaction: The user needs to either open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page, therefore this is not a zero-click exploit.
