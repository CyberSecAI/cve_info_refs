Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Cisco Application-hosting Framework (CAF) component of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software when the IOx feature set is enabled. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of HTTP headers, leading to a HTTP header injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is an HTTP header injection vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability allows the injection of malicious HTTP headers that influence how the CAF user interacts with external resources. The injected header causes a user to download a file controlled by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a CAF user to download a file controlled by the attacker. This could lead to the user executing malicious code if the attacker crafts an executable. The primary impact is a compromise of integrity due to the user downloading a malicious file. The impact is rated as "Partial" for integrity, because the scope of the impact depends on the user's actions after downloading the file and is limited to the userâ€™s environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is "Network," meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco device with the CAF enabled. The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability, highlighting its severity.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **Base Score:** 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
    *   **AV:N** (Network): The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    *   **AC:M** (Medium): The complexity of an attack is medium.
    *   **Au:N** (None): No authentication is required.
    *  **C:N** (None): No impact to confidentiality.
    *   **I:P** (Partial): Partial impact to integrity.
    *   **A:N** (None): No impact to availability.
*  **Temporal Score:** 3.6 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)
    *   **E:F** (Functional): Functional exploit code is available.
    *   **RL:OF** (Official Fix): An official fix is available from the vendor.
    *   **RC:C** (Confirmed): The vulnerability is confirmed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software with the IOx feature set.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than updating to a patched version.
*   Cisco has released fixed software to address the vulnerability, available through the Cisco Bug Search Tool.
*   The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
