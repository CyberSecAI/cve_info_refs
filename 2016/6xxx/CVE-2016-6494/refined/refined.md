Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6494:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the MongoDB client creating the `.dbshell` history file with world-readable permissions (0644). This file stores a history of commands executed in the MongoDB shell.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the creation of the history file with overly permissive access rights. This allows other local users to read the file.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The `.dbshell` file can contain sensitive information such as database names, collection names, query structures, and even potentially user credentials or other sensitive data if included in queries or updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** A local attacker can read the `.dbshell` file of other users on the same system.
*   **Potential Credential Exposure:** While `db.auth` commands are not stored, sensitive information might be present if, for example, usernames, passwords or other authentication secrets are stored in a collection and accessed via commands logged in the history file (e.g. `db.users.find({user:"foo"})` or `db.users.update({user:"foo"},{$set:{password:"OhComeOnNow"}})`.
*   **Compromised Data Access:** Exposed database names, collection names, and query structures can be used to further an attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is purely local. An attacker needs to have user-level access to the same system as the victim user whose `.dbshell` file is being targeted.
*   **File Reading:** The attacker needs to be able to read files in the home directories of other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the same machine as the target user.
*   **Basic File Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read files in the home directory of other users. Default Debian setups allow this.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the MongoDB client to create the `.dbshell` file with more restrictive permissions (0600) on most Linux distributions.  This ensures the file is readable only by the user who created it.
*   The fix was implemented by modifying the `linenoise.cpp` file to change the file creation method, using `open()` and `fdopen()` to create the file with specific user-read/write permissions.
*   Some distributions performed backports of the fix to their older, supported MongoDB versions.
* Some Linux distros also applied fixes to redact sensitive data in logs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Upstream MongoDB initially considered this issue to be "Works as Designed," stating that the file permissions are affected by the umask of the user. However, they later addressed the issue by changing the permissions of the history file to be user-only.
*   Some distributions, such as Debian, decided to fix this issue regardless of upstream's stance on the matter.
*   The vulnerability was present in multiple versions of MongoDB, including 2.4.10 and earlier.
*   This vulnerability has a relatively low attack complexity, as it only requires local user access.
