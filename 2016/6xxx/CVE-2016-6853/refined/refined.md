      "vulnerability": {
        "rootCause": "Script code and references to external websites can be injected into the names of PGP public keys. When a key is requested via a specific URL, the injected script code might execute or a user might be redirected to an external website.",

        "impact": "Malicious script code execution within a user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or unwanted actions via the web interface (e.g., sending mail, deleting data). Phishing attacks can also occur by luring users to external sites.",
        "attackVectors": "The attacker crafts a PGP key with a malicious name containing script code or references to external websites. Then the attacker generates a link to fetch the malicious key and lures the victim into clicking the link.",
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and host a PGP key with a malicious name. The attacker needs to entice a victim into clicking a link that fetches the malicious key."
