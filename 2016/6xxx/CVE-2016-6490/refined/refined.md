Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6490:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the `virtqueue_pop()` function within QEMU's virtio framework. This function did not properly handle zero-sized buffers, leading to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Size Validation:** The code did not validate the size of I/O descriptor buffers. Specifically, it did not check if the buffer length was zero before proceeding with I/O operations.
- **Infinite Loop:** When a zero-sized buffer was encountered, the `virtqueue_pop()` function entered an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged user inside a guest virtual machine could trigger the infinite loop by providing a zero-sized I/O descriptor buffer, causing the QEMU instance on the host to become unresponsive and effectively crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Guest-to-Host Attack:** The attack vector is from a guest virtual machine to the host system running QEMU.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Privileged Guest User:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user (e.g., root) within the guest operating system.
- **Ability to manipulate Virtio Device:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the virtio device within the guest to craft the malicious I/O request containing a zero sized buffer.
