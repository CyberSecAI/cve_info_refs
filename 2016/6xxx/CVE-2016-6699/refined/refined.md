Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** error in Mediaserver when reconnecting to an HTTP media source. This means that the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed, which can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition, where the Mediaserver attempts to use memory associated with a freed object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** This vulnerability is rated as "Critical" because it could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Mediaserver process. This is a significant security risk, as it could lead to the attacker gaining control over the device.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can also result in memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Media File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted media file.
- **HTTP Media Source:** The specific trigger is when Mediaserver attempts to reconnect to an HTTP media source.
- **Multiple Methods:** The vulnerability can be exploited through various methods like email, web browsing, and MMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Ability to Deliver Media Files:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted media file to the target device. This could be achieved through various means, as mentioned above.

**Additional Details:**

-   The fix for this vulnerability is associated with AOSP bug ID A-31373622.
-   The patch for this vulnerability has been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository with commit ID `3b1c9f692c4d4b7a683c2b358fc89e831a641b88`

In summary, CVE-2016-6699 is a critical vulnerability because it allows remote code execution via a use-after-free flaw when processing media files over HTTP. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to gain control of the affected device by sending a malicious media file.
