Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-6437:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the SSL session cache management of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS). Improper management of the SSL session cache leads to excessive disk space consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A vulnerability is present in how the Cisco WAAS manages the SSL session cache. The system does not properly limit the size of the SSL cache, allowing it to grow excessively.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The excessive disk space usage results in performance degradation for the affected WAAS devices.
- The impact is primarily a loss of availability, with no compromise to confidentiality or integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote and unauthenticated.
- Attackers can cause excessive disk space consumption through SSL management traffic (TCP port 443) to the WAAS Central Manager (CM) or WAAS accelerators receiving SSL connection requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SSL connection requests to the affected WAAS device. No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send enough traffic to fill the available disk space with SSL session cache data.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects both the SSL (TCP port 443) management traffic of the WAAS Central Manager (CM) and the WAAS accelerators receiving SSL connection requests.
*   A temporary workaround is provided, which involves manually removing the SSL cache files and restarting services. A more permanent solution would involve contacting Cisco TAC to get a script to properly configure the SSL cache file.
*   The advisory notes that Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) and temporal score of 3.6 (E:F/RL:OF/RC:C).
