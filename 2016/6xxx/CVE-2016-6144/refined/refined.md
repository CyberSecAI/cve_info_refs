Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The SAP HANA SYSTEM user lacked protection against brute-force attacks. Specifically, the system did not enforce a limit on the number of login attempts before locking the SYSTEM user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of a mechanism to limit the number of failed login attempts for the SYSTEM user account, allowing an attacker to make unlimited login attempts without the account being locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the SAP HANA platform's most powerful user (SYSTEM). This grants the attacker unrestricted access to all business information stored in the SAP HANA database, leading to a full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network using the SQL interface.
*   **Brute Force Attack:** An attacker can repeatedly attempt to log in using different passwords for the SYSTEM user until the correct password is found.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SAP HANA database's SQL interface (TCP port 3XX15, where XX is the instance number).
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need any existing user credentials or prior authentication.
*   **Ability to Send Login Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send login requests to the SAP HANA database to attempt various passwords.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** SAP HANA DB 1.00.73.00.389160 (NewDB100_REL) (HANA 1.0 SPS09).
*   **CVSS Scores:**
    *   Vendor CVSS v2: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
    *   Onapsis CVSS v2: 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
    *   Onapsis CVSS v3: 9.0 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Solution:** Implement SAP Security Note 2216869. This security note introduces a new parameter “password\_lock\_for\_system\_user” which allows the SYSTEM user to be locked after a threshold of invalid login attempts is reached.

The Onapsis advisory provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the lack of brute-force protection for the SYSTEM user which was not apparent in the initial CVE description.
