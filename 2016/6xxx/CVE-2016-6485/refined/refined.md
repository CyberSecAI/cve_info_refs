{
  "CVE-2016-6485": {
    "Description": "The __construct function in Framework/Encryption/Crypt.php in Magento 2 uses the PHP rand function to generate a random number for the initialization vector, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by guessing the value.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of PHP's `rand()` function to generate the initialization vector (IV) for cryptographic operations. This function is not cryptographically secure, making the IV predictable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of insecure random number generator (`rand()`) for cryptographic IV generation.",
      "Lack of proper cryptographic practices in IV generation."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially defeat the cryptographic protection mechanisms by guessing the IV, leading to decryption or forging of encrypted data.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to observe or manipulate encrypted data and potentially study the output of decryption operations.",
	  "More Details": "The Magento encryption library does not properly authenticate encrypted data, and uses ECB mode which is vulnerable to replay and cut and paste attacks. The library also uses a weak IV generated by PHP's rand() function, making the encryption easier to break by guessing the IV."
