{
  "CVE-2016-6195": {
    "Description": "The vBulletin core forumrunner addon (enabled by default) was affected by an SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `do_get_spam_data()` function within `/forumrunner/includes/moderation.php`. Input parameters `postids` and `threadid` are passed to the database query without proper sanitization, specifically, they are filtered as `TYPE_STRING`, which does not protect from SQL injection. The lack of using `intval()` on these parameters is the core issue.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete database takeover. The provided exploit allows for extraction of user table hashes.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious `cmd` parameter set to `get_spam_data` along with the SQL injection payload in the `postids` parameter through HTTP requests to `/forumrunner/request.php`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable vBulletin instance. No prior authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability. They must also know the vulnerable parameter names."
