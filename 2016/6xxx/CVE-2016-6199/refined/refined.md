Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of data using `ObjectInputStream` in the `ObjectSocketWrapper` class. This class is used in the `jetty` and `ui` subprojects of Gradle. The `readObject()` method in this class directly deserializes data from a socket's input stream without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the usage of `ObjectInputStream` on data received from a network socket without any prior validation. This allows an attacker to send malicious serialized Java objects that can be deserialized and executed.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The application does not validate the incoming data stream before attempting to deserialize it.
*   **Reliance on Classpath Gadgets:** The exploit relies on the presence of vulnerable "gadget chains" within the application's classpath. These are classes that, when deserialized, can trigger arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable Gradle instance. This could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can gain control of the system running the vulnerable Gradle instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Socket:** The attack vector is the network socket opened by the affected Gradle subprojects (`jetty` and `ui`). Attackers can connect to this socket and send malicious serialized data.
*   **Specific subprojects:** The vulnerable code is located within the `ui` and `jetty` subprojects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the machine running the vulnerable Gradle instance and must be able to connect to the listening socket.
*   **Knowledge of Deserialization Exploits:** The attacker needs to be aware of Java deserialization vulnerabilities and possess the capability to create malicious serialized payloads (e.g., using `ysoserial`).
*   **Gadget Chain:** The attacker needs a valid gadget chain present in the application's classpath to execute arbitrary code after deserialization.

**Additional details:**

*   The initial report was made on May 23, 2016, on the Gradle forum by "rootredrain", while "philwantsfish" had also discovered the vulnerability and was about to report it.
*   The `ui` subproject can be easily targeted by launching it using `./gradlew --gui`.
*   The blog post by "philwantsfish" provides a deeper insight into the vulnerability and proof of concept details.
*   The specific version of `commons-collections` library which can be exploited in combination with `ysoserial` is 3.2.1, as shown when downgrading to Gradle 2.12.
*   The report states that while the vulnerability is present, the default dependencies of the vulnerable code, at the time of reporting, did not contain the needed vulnerable gadget chain.
*   The report also mentions the request for a CVE to track this vulnerability.
