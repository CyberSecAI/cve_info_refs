Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6329:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**
The content from sweet32.info, the IBM security bulletin, and the Gentoo security advisory directly mention CVE-2016-6329 and describe the "Sweet32" attack. This attack targets the use of 64-bit block ciphers in protocols like TLS and OpenVPN, which matches the description of CVE-2016-6329. Therefore, the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the use of 64-bit block ciphers (like 3DES and Blowfish) in protocols like TLS and OpenVPN. Due to their small block size, these ciphers become vulnerable to birthday attacks when large amounts of data are encrypted under the same key. This leads to collisions, potentially revealing plaintext data.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Small Block Size:** The primary weakness is the 64-bit block size of ciphers like 3DES and Blowfish. This limitation makes them susceptible to collision attacks after a relatively small amount of data is processed (compared to 128-bit block ciphers like AES).
    *   **Lack of Key Rotation:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the failure to frequently re-key connections. Long-lived connections using these ciphers can allow attackers to collect enough encrypted traffic to exploit the birthday attack.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a breach of confidentiality. By exploiting collisions, attackers can recover plaintext data, including sensitive information such as HTTP cookies and authentication tokens.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Exploitation requires a man-in-the-middle attacker who can observe and capture encrypted traffic.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Monitoring:** The attacker needs to passively monitor network traffic between a client and server using the vulnerable cipher.
    *   **Traffic Generation:**  Attackers can actively generate traffic using Javascript in a browser (man-in-the-browser) to cause more data to be encrypted and expose more collisions, or by other means.
    *   **Data Collection:** Attackers need to collect a large amount of encrypted traffic to successfully perform the attack, typically hundreds of gigabytes, or sometimes terabytes, depending on the specific context and the amount of known plaintext available to accelerate the process.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, having a network-level position to observe and capture encrypted traffic, which could be a man-in-the-middle.
    *   **No User Interaction:** The attack typically does not require user interaction beyond the user having an active connection using a vulnerable cipher.
    *   **No System Privileges:** The attacker does not need to have any privileged access to the target systems.
    *   **Persistent Connection:** The attack relies on long-lived connections, meaning the attacker must be able to maintain the connection long enough to collect enough data.

**3. Additional Information**

*   **"Sweet32" Name:** The attack is called "Sweet32" because it uses the "birthday paradox" to exploit collisions in 64-bit block ciphers, referencing the birthday celebration of "Sweet Sixteen," where 2^16 calculations make collisions much more likely.
*   **Affected Protocols:** The attack affects TLS, OpenVPN, IPsec, and other protocols that support 64-bit block ciphers.
*   **Practicality:** The Sweet32 paper demonstrates that the attack has become practical, with an attack against HTTPS potentially achievable in less than two days (using malicious Javascript) and an attack against OpenVPN taking under 20 hours.
*   **Mitigation:**  The content recommends disabling 64-bit block ciphers and using AES, or other 128-bit block ciphers, instead. If 3DES or Blowfish must be used, key rotation or re-keying before 32GB of data is exchanged is recommended.
*   **Vendor Response:** The content describes that various vendors, including OpenVPN, OpenSSL, Mozilla, and Microsoft, have started taking action to mitigate the Sweet32 attack. For example, OpenVPN now recommends using AES, OpenSSL moved 3DES to its MEDIUM category, Mozilla added data limits, and Microsoft removed 3DES from its False Start whitelist.

**4. Relation to CVE-2016-2183:**

The IBM security bulletin notes that both CVE-2016-2183 and CVE-2016-6329 refer to the Sweet32 attack, which exploits 64-bit block ciphers. CVE-2016-2183 specifically references OpenSSL, where CVE-2016-6329 refers to the OpenVPN vulnerability. The root cause and general attack techniques are the same for both CVEs.

In summary, CVE-2016-6329 is related to a practical attack on 64-bit block ciphers like 3DES and Blowfish, exposing plaintext and requiring the use of more robust cryptographic methods.
