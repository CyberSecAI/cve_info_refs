Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the XML parser used by the SAP Business One Android application. The application fails to properly handle XML input containing references to external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XXE injection. This occurs when the XML parser processes external entities defined within the XML input, which can point to either local or remote resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information from the server by exploiting the XXE vulnerability to read local files or initiate requests to internal services.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can use the vulnerable application to perform server-side requests to other internal or external servers. This can be used for scanning internal networks, or for other malicious activity.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly mentioned as the primary impact, the vulnerability could be used to cause a denial of service by overloading the server with requests via the external entity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XML Payload Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious XML payload into the application's SOAP request. This payload includes a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration that defines an external entity that the XML parser processes.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerable requests are sent to `/B1iXcellerator/exec/soap/vP.001sap0003.in_WCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_WS_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_WS_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc` via HTTP POST.
*   **Manipulated XML:** The attacker crafts an XML payload containing a malicious external entity definition which is inserted into the SOAP request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable SAP Business One application.
*   **Understanding of XML/SOAP:** The attacker needs knowledge about the structure of XML and SOAP requests to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit was tested with version 1.2.3 of the SAP Business One Android Application.
*   The example payloads in the exploit details demonstrate both attempts to external resources (http://live.com) and local/internal resources (http://127.0.0.1:8080)
*  The vulnerability was fixed with a patch released by SAP on 13/12/2016.
