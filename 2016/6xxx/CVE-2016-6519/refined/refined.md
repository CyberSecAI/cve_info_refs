  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided documents describe a persistent XSS vulnerability in the OpenStack Manila UI, identified as CVE-2016-6519.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `mark_safe()` on user-supplied metadata within the 'Create Share' form of the OpenStack Manila UI. This function renders the HTML/JavaScript code without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
         "Use of `mark_safe()` on unsanitized user input."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow remote, authenticated but unprivileged users to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the metadata field. This code would be reflected in the 'Shares' overview, enabling attackers to steal session cookies and escalate privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via the 'Create Share' form's metadata field.",
          "Injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code within the metadata field."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated, but unprivileged user of the OpenStack Manila UI."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability also affects the admin dashboard with 'share types' and extra specs. The malicious payload may need to be split over multiple keys due to size limitations. The issue was addressed by escaping HTML-specific symbols in the output string of the metadata_to_str function. The fix was released in openstack/manila-ui 2.5.1 and 2.6.0. Red Hat also released RHSA advisories (RHSA-2016:2115, RHSA-2016:2116, RHSA-2016:2117) addressing this issue."
