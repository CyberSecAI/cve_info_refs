"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the package unbundle utility of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain write access to some files in the underlying operating system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of files submitted to the affected installation utility. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to an affected system and running the installation utility command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain write access to some files in the underlying operating system, which could allow the attacker to override the write-accessible files and compromise the integrity of the system.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have sufficient privileges to execute the appropriate commands. In a default configuration, the privilege 15 privilege is needed to exploit this vulnerability. As a secondary impact of this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to modify some files and obtain access to the underlying operating system shell without having to provide a valid license.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\n"

All the preceding products are vulnerable if they are running an vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software. For information about vulnerable software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have privileged access to an affected system and must also be able transfer a crafted file and execute privileged commands on the system.\n\r\n\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the command-line interface (CLI), and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS XE Software or similar text.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.6.5E:\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 03.06.05.E RELEASE SOFTWARE7 (fc2)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Thu 02-Jun-16 09:03 by prod\_rel\_team\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"]."

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 1.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 1.2 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 1.2 |
