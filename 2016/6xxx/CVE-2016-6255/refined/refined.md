      "description": "Portable UPnP SDK (aka libupnp) before 1.6.21 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files in the webroot via a POST request without a registered handler.",
      "root_cause": "The libupnp library, by default, allows writing to the file system when a POST request is received without a registered handler.",

        "Unrestricted file write",
