# [R1] Debian MediaTomb (fork) Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

[MediaTomb](http://mediatomb.cc/) is an open source UPnP MediaServer. For various reasons, MediaTomb has seen wide deployment over the years. However, the project appears to have been abandoned by the creators as the primary website hasn’t seen an update since 2010 and the SorceForge SVN repository [hasn’t seen a commit since 2014](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mediatomb/). However, that has not slowed the apparent love and integration of MediaTomb. The SourceForge page claims over 200 downloads this week, the discussion forums have been written to fairly recently, and [Stack Overflow still gets questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39398102/need-to-restart-mediatomb-to-get-it-recognized).

This is probably because [Ubuntu has continued offering it as a package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mediatomb). However, they [haven’t done a lot to the code themselves it appears](https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/wily/mediatomb/wily), even though [open bugs exists](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mediatomb). For the purposes of this write up, we will be referring to the Ubuntu package since they appear to be hosting/distributing more than anyone else. That said, other Linux distributions may have their own forks of MediaTomb and be vulnerable to the same issues below, such as Debian as we later confirmed.

About the MediaTomb Code

Anyone that has had the distinct displeasure of reading the [Portable Universal Plug and Play SDK (libupnp)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pupnp/) source code would immediately recognize that MediaTomb is built on a fork of libupnp. Indeed, some quick investigation into this confirmed that MediaTomb uses their own libUPnP with "[various custom patches and extensions](https://sourceforge.net/p/mediatomb/bugs/114/)". Notice, that the Fedora mediatomb package maintainer even links to a libupnp [CERT VU](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681). We can only assume that libupnp vulnerabilities don’t apply, right?

While testing a new NASL detection script, we found it was causing a crash in MediaTomb. Specifically, there is a NULL pointer dereference at in the function `check_soap_body()` in `soap_device.c` (line 470). We went to see if this had been patched in libupnp and found that it [had been patched eight years ago](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/2c094ee8ea01259967f82513296b031f718603fd/).

Given that MediaTomb is still being distributed by Ubuntu and more than 1,000 instances are [visible via Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=MediaTomb), we will make a best-effort to quickly flag some of the vulnerabilities that we know have been fixed in libupnp and still exist in MediaTomb. All of the below have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 Desktop using mediatomb-dbg.

Fedora actually has this in their bug tracker for MediaTomb along with the other 2012 stack overflows, [all unfixed](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=906045), despite [an upstream patch being available](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/2bb79879b77dd215a26c92d1348adf2ae406dfd8/).

We've written a PoC cleverly named "`cve-2012-5958.py`" that triggers the issue, producing the following stack trace:

```

We’ve also written a PoC named "`cve-2012-5959.py`" (consistency is key) that triggers the issue, producing a different stack trace.

Bug 1948586

A null pointer dereference can be triggered via an HTTP POST with malformed SOAP data, [with an upstream patch available](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/2c094ee8ea01259967f82513296b031f718603fd/). We wrote a PoC cleverly named "`bug_1948586.py`" that triggers the issue in MediaTomb. Note that the old SourceForge bug tracker that used 7-digit IDs was deprecated, and it does not appear that those tickets were preserved, at least not publicly. As such, we only have a commit that references the old bug ID, and the commit details itself.

[Bug 133](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/bugs/133/) (no CVE)

A heap overflow can be triggered when providing specifically crafted callback parameters. Currently, there does not seem to be a patch for this issue. We wrote a PoC cleverly named "`bug_133.py`" that triggers the issue in MediaTomb to demonstrate the issue.

CVE-2016-6255

This allows a remote unauthenticated attacker create arbitrary files in the WebRoot simply by sending an HTTP POST request. Note that Ubuntu's mediatomb installation must have write permission to the WebRoot directory. This issue has been patched by commit [c91a8a3](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/c91a8a3903367e1163765b73eb4d43be7d7927fa/) and [66e43a2](https://sourceforge.net/p/pupnp/code/ci/66e43a28d27fee95d270d2b8106d8a099c14f334/). We wrote a PoC cleverly named "`barking_aardvark.py`" that when used like so:

`$ ./barking_aardvark.py http://192.168.1.217:49153/danger_zone`

Will result in a file being created. This can be seen in the default Ubuntu install, with the following sorcery:

```

albino-lobster@ubuntu:~ $ cat /usr/share/mediatomb/web/danger_zone
Better call Kenny Loggins
albino-lobster@ubuntu:~ $

```

### Solution

See the details above which link to fixing commits where applicable. Since this is a third-party library used within a fork of mediatomb and impacts multiple Linux distributions, it is up to each one to resolve the issues in their installation. In the meantime, restrict access to the mediatomb server.

### Proof of Concept

That's a negative Ghost Rider.

#### Description

Stack-based buffer overflow in the unique\_service\_name function in ssdp/ssdp\_server.c in the SSDP parser in the portable SDK for UPnP Devices (aka libupnp, formerly the Intel SDK for UPnP devices) before 1.6.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a UDP packet with a crafted string that is not properly handled after a certain pointer subtraction.

This can have a CVE ID: from our perspective the product is exposing
unnecessary functionality, end users typically would consider the
functionality unwanted and unsafe, the behavior violates the
expectations of users familiar with similar products, the behavior
isn't (as far as we know) required or suggested by any protocol or
specification, and the behavior is implemented in a confusing way.

Use CVE-2016-6255.

Another observation is that it is not necessary for a user to write a
libupnp-based application in order to encounter the vulnerability.
(One might conceivably argue that, if exploitation required a custom
application, the application author would be responsible for verifying
that the code met expectations as far as whether a web server should
exist and what types of read and write access should be allowed.)
Instead, anyone can build the unpatched code from GitHub, go to the
upnp/sample directory, and execute the tv_device script with no
arguments. This apparently starts the web server on port 49152 by
default. The web server accepts unauthenticated POST requests and
stores the data to the client-specified filename within the
upnp/sample/web directory. It also accepts unauthenticated GET
requests for those files.

Common user expectations, based on experience with any popular
general-purpose web server, are that defaulting to unauthenticated
POSTs with readable uploads should not happen unless specifically
called out in the documentation. This is the main reason for the CVE.
Also, if the POST behavior were important, the web server should at
least follow RFC 2616 section 9.5 and return a 201 status when it
creates a file in the upnp/sample/web directory. It currently returns
200, which makes it somewhat harder for a person auditing an
application to notice that the POSTs are actually successful.

Don't allow unhandled POSTs to write to the filesystem by default

```
If there's no registered handler for a POST request, the default behaviour
is to write it to the filesystem. Several million deployed devices appear
to have this behaviour, making it possible to (at least) store arbitrary
data on them. Add a configure option that enables this behaviour, and change
the default to just drop POSTs that aren't directly handled.

Package        : libupnp
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-6255 CVE-2016-8863
Debian Bug     : 831857 842093

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in libupnp, a portable SDK for
UPnP devices.

CVE-2016-6255

  Matthew Garret discovered that libupnp by default allows any user to
  write to the filesystem of the host running a libupnp-based server
  application.

CVE-2016-8863

  Scott Tenaglia discovered a heap buffer overflow vulnerability, that
  can lead to denial of service or remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.19+git20141001-1+deb8u1.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 1:1.6.19+git20160116-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Subject: libupnp write files via POST

Hi,

Wanted to point out this report by Matthew Garret (not sure if there's
anything else than a couple of tweets public):
<https://twitter.com/mjg59/status/755062278513319936>

Notable:
"Reported this to upstream 8 months ago without response, so: libupnp's
default behaviour allows anyone to write to your filesystem"
"Seriously. Find a device running a libupnp based server (Shodan says
there's rather a lot), and POST a file to /testfile. Then GET /testfile"
"…and yeah if the server is running as root (it is) and is using / as
the web root (probably not, but maybe) this gives full host fs access"

And later on:
"Emailed the Debian security team a couple of months ago, no response"

Not good...

Patch:

# Exploit Title: MiCasa VeraLite Remote Code Execution
# Date: 10-20-2016
# Software Link: http://getvera.com/controllers/veralite/
# Exploit Author: Jacob Baines
# Contact: https://twitter.com/Junior_Baines
# CVE: CVE-2013-4863 & CVE-2016-6255
# Platform: Hardware

1. Description

A remote attacker can execute code on the MiCasa VeraLite if someone on the same LAN as the VeraLite visits a crafted webpage.

2. Proof of Concept

<!--
    @about
    This file, when loaded in a browser, will attempt to get a reverse shell
    on a VeraLite device on the client's network. This is achieved with the
    following steps:

    1. Acquire the client's internal IP address using webrtc. We then assume the
       client is operating on a \24 network.
    2. POST :49451/z3n.html to every address on the subnet. This leverages two
       things we know to be true about VeraLite:
           - there should be a UPnP HTTP server on 49451
           - VeraLite uses a libupnp vulnerable to CVE-2016-6255.
    3. Attempt to load :49451/z3n.html in an iframe. This will exist if step 2
       successfully created the file via CVE-2016-6255
    4. z3n.html will allow us to bypass same origin policy and it will make a
       POST request that executes RunLau. This also leverages information we
       know to be true about Veralite:
           - the control URL for HomeAutomationGateway is /upnp/control/hag
           - no auth required
    5. Our RunLua code executes a reverse shell to 192.168.217:1270.

    @note
    This code doesn't run fast in Firefox. This appears to largely be a performance
    issue associated with attaching a lot of iframes to a page. Give the shell
    popping a couple of minutes. In Chrome, it runs pretty fast but might
    exhaust socket usage.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# STUN IP Address requests for WebRTC

Demo: <https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/>

### What this does

Firefox and Chrome have implemented WebRTC that allow requests to STUN servers be made that will return the local and public IP addresses for the user. These request results are available to javascript, so you can now obtain a users local and public IP addresses in javascript. This demo is an example implementation of that.

Additionally, these STUN requests are made outside of the normal XMLHttpRequest procedure, so they are not visible in the developer console or able to be blocked by plugins such as AdBlockPlus or Ghostery. This makes these types of requests available for online tracking if an advertiser sets up a STUN server with a wildcard domain.

### Code

Here is the annotated demo function that makes the STUN request. You can copy and paste this into the Firefox or Chrome developer console to run the test.

```
//get the IP addresses associated with an account
function getIPs(callback){
    var ip_dups = {};

    //compatibility for firefox and chrome
    var RTCPeerConnection = window.RTCPeerConnection
        || window.mozRTCPeerConnection
        || window.webkitRTCPeerConnection;
    var useWebKit = !!window.webkitRTCPeerConnection;

    //bypass naive webrtc blocking using an iframe
    if(!RTCPeerConnection){
        //NOTE: you need to have an iframe in the page right above the script tag
        //
        //<iframe id="iframe" sandbox="allow-same-origin" style="display: none"></iframe>
        //<script>...getIPs called in here...
        //
        var win = iframe.contentWindow;
        RTCPeerConnection = win.RTCPeerConnection
            || win.mozRTCPeerConnection
            || win.webkitRTCPeerConnection;
        useWebKit = !!win.webkitRTCPeerConnection;
    }

    //minimal requirements for data connection
    var mediaConstraints = {
        optional: [{RtpDataChannels: true}]
    };

    var servers = {iceServers: [{urls: "stun:stun.services.mozilla.com"}]};

    //construct a new RTCPeerConnection
    var pc = new RTCPeerConnection(servers, mediaConstraints);

    function handleCandidate(candidate){
        //match just the IP address
        var ip_regex = /([0-9]{1,3}(\.[0-9]{1,3}){3}|[a-f0-9]{1,4}(:[a-f0-9]{1,4}){7})/
        var ip_addr = ip_regex.exec(candidate)[1];

        //remove duplicates
        if(ip_dups[ip_addr] === undefined)
            callback(ip_addr);

        ip_dups[ip_addr] = true;
    }

    //listen for candidate events
    pc.onicecandidate = function(ice){

        //skip non-candidate events
        if(ice.candidate)
            handleCandidate(ice.candidate.candidate);
    };

    //create a bogus data channel
    pc.createDataChannel("");

    //create an offer sdp
    pc.createOffer(function(result){

        //trigger the stun server request
        pc.setLocalDescription(result, function(){}, function(){});

    }, function(){});

    //wait for a while to let everything done
    setTimeout(function(){
        //read candidate info from local description
        var lines = pc.localDescription.sdp.split('\n');

        lines.forEach(function(line){
            if(line.indexOf('a=candidate:') === 0)
                handleCandidate(line);
        });
    }, 1000);
}

//Test: Print the IP addresses into the console
getIPs(function(ip){console.log(ip);});
```
