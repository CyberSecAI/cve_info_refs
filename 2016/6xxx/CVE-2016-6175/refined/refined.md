Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6175:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `$string` variable within the `select_string()` function of the `gettext.php` library. This variable, derived from plural forms data in `.mo` files, is directly passed to the `eval()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unsafe use of `eval()`:** The primary weakness is the direct use of PHP's `eval()` function on user-controlled data extracted from `.mo` files. This allows for arbitrary PHP code execution.
2.  **Insufficient Sanitization:** While there's a sanitization function (`sanitize_plural_expression()`), it is not robust enough to prevent injection of malicious code, as it only filters specific characters, and can still allow calling functions like `system()` by crafting a malicious `.mo` file
3. **Deprecated `eregi()` Function**: The code uses the `eregi()` function to validate the `plural-forms` header, which is deprecated (since PHP 5.3.0) and can be bypassed by adding a null byte. This is not a direct issue for exploitation but shows other possible vulnerabilities in the code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server by crafting malicious `.mo` files, leading to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains privileges of the web server, potentially escalating to higher privileges based on the web server user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious `.mo` File Injection:** An attacker must be able to overwrite or introduce malicious `.mo` language files on the server, either directly or by exploiting other vulnerabilities on the application that uses gettext.php.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Modify `.mo` Files:** The attacker needs the ability to overwrite or create `.mo` language files accessible to the web server. This might require exploiting a different vulnerability in an application using the vulnerable library.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `select_string()` function within `gettext.php`.
*   The function reads the plural forms header from the `.mo` file.
*   It attempts to sanitize the expression via `sanitize_plural_expression()`.
*   The sanitized string is then used inside a call to `eval()`.
*   The attacker can use PHP functions such as system() or backticks to gain code execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit PoC code demonstrates how to inject arbitrary PHP code by manipulating the plural forms expression.
*   The vulnerability is present in `gettext.php` versions 1.0.12 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of the NagVis project, which uses the vulnerable library, but the main impact isn't on NagVis itself, but on the web applications using this library and its handling of translations files.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1.
*   The fix involved replacing `eval()` with a custom parser for the plural expressions.
