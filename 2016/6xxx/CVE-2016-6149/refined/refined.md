Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource. Specifically, SAP HANA users with the system privilege `EXPORT` were able to export table content to the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient access control: The `EXPORT` system privilege granted users more access than intended, allowing them to write data to the server's file system.
- Information disclosure: The ability to export table content could allow an attacker to access sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker could access business information indexed by the SAP system by exporting table data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation: The vulnerability can only be exploited locally on the SAP HANA server.
- User with `EXPORT` privilege: Exploitation requires an attacker to have a valid user account with the `EXPORT` system privilege in SAP HANA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the SAP HANA server.
- A valid SAP HANA user account with the `EXPORT` system privilege.
