Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** An undisclosed vulnerability exists within IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation. This allows a JazzGuest user to view project area names even when they lack the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a lack of proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to view sensitive project area names.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A JazzGuest user can view project area names they shouldn't have access to. While the vulnerability allows unauthorized access, it is limited to viewing names of project areas, not the contents of those areas. The impact is primarily information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:** Network-based. An attacker with a JazzGuest user account can exploit the vulnerability by accessing the application through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs a valid JazzGuest user account to be able to access the application and exploit this vulnerability. No special privileges beyond this are explicitly mentioned.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS Base Score:** 4.3
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    *  **PR:L (Low):** Requires low level of privileges (JazzGuest user account).
    *   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required for the exploit.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not change the security scope.
    *   **C:L (Low):** The impact to confidentiality is low (disclosure of project area names)
    *   **I:N (None):** There is no impact to integrity
    *   **A:N (None):** There is no impact to availability.
