## Install / Upgrade from previous versions

Users upgrading from 3.6 should be aware of following 4.0 changes around
authentication and certificates handling:

1. Single Sign-On using OAUTH2 protocol has been implemented in engine to
   allow SSO between webadmin, userportal and RESTAPI. More information can
   be found at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1092744
2. Due to SSO it’s required to access engine only using the same FQDN which
   was specified during engine-setup invocation. If your engine FQDN is not
   accessible from all engine clients, you will not be able to login. Please
   use ovirt-engine-rename tool to fix your FQDN, more information can be
   found at /documentation/how-to/networking/changing-engine-hostname/ .
   If you try to access engine using IP or DNS alias, an error will be
   thrown. Please consult following bugs targeted to oVirt 4.0.4 which
   should fix this limitation:
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1325746
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1362196
3. If you have used Kerberos SSO to access engine, please consult
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1342192 how to update your Apache
   configuration after upgrade to 4.0
4. If you are using HTTPS certificate signed by custom certificate
   authority, please take a look at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1336838
   for steps which need to be done after migration to 4.0. Also please
   consult https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1313379 how to setup this custom
   CA for use with virt-viewer clients.

### Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install

`# yum install` [`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm)

and then follow documentation from our downstream
[Red Hat Virtualization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/)

If you’re upgrading from a previous release on Enterprise Linux 7 you just need to execute:

```
  # yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release40.rpm
  # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"
  # engine-setup

```

Upgrade on Fedora 22 and Enterprise Linux 6 is not supported and you should follow our [Migration Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20170723145830/http%3A//www.ovirt.org/documentation/migration-engine-36-to-40/) in order to migrate to Enterprise Linux 7 or Fedora 23.

### oVirt Hosted Engine

If you’re going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow
Red Hat Virtualization [Self Hosted Engine Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.0/html/self-hosted_engine_guide/index)

If you’re upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow
Red Hat Virtualization [Upgrade Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.0/html/upgrade_guide/index)

## Known issues

* [BZ 1297835](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1297835) **Host install fails on Fedora 23 due to lack of dep on python2-dnf**
  On Fedora >= 23 dnf package manager with python 3 is used by default while
  ovirt-host-deploy is executed by ovirt-engine using python2. This cause Host install to fail on Fedora >= 23 due to lack of python2-dnf in the default environment. As workaround please install manually python2-dnf on the host before trying to add it to the engine.

## What’s New in 4.0.3?

### Enhancements

#### ovirt-distribution

* [BZ 1368446](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1368446) **Rebase qemu-kvm-ev to 2.3.0-31.el7\_2.21**

  qemu-kvm-ev has been rebased to 2.3.0-31.el7\_2.21 including security fixes for CVE-2016-5126 and CVE-2016-5403.

  A build for ppc64le has been provided as well.

### Deprecated Functionality

#### Documentation

* [BZ 1255230](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1255230)
  Additional self-hosted engine hosts can only be added via the Administration Portal,
  and can no longer be added by running ‘hosted-engine –deploy’ on the host.

### Unclassified

#### oVirt Hosted Engine HA

##### Team: Integration

* [BZ 1367732](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367732) **If ovirt-ha-agent fails to read local answers.conf during upgrade, it writes None to shared fhanswers.conf**

#### oVirt Engine Dashboard

##### Team: UX

* [BZ 1347238](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1347238) **Tooltip on sparkline changes proportions based on time and wraps text to new line**

#### oVirt Engine

##### Team: Infra

* [BZ 1367513](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367513) **Kerberos negotiation for RESTAPI should be enabled by default to maintain SDK v3 compatibility**
  ENGINE\_RESTAPI\_NEGO config variable enables or disables the restapi negotiate authentication. If all restapi clients are RESTAPI/SDK v4 then this can be set to false. It is required to be set to true only for compatibility with RESTAPI/SDK v3.6 clients. By default the variable is set to true to maintain compatibility with v3.6 clients.

##### Team: Integration

But at the same time: Value of property 'ENGINE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET' is '***'.  DWH_DB_PASSWORD should be hidden too   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1363816#c3)  Yedidyah Bar David    2016-08-24 06:58:30 UTC  ``` AFAICT this refers to engine log files, not dwh (or engine-setup). Changing product/component.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1363816#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla Rules Engine    2016-08-24 06:59:31 UTC  ``` Target release should be placed once a package build is known to fix a issue. Since this bug is not modified, the target version has been reset.
