Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism within the Jackrabbit-Webdav component. The content-type check for POST requests failed to properly handle missing `Content-Type` header fields, and variations in header values such as upper/lower case or optional parameters. This allowed attackers to bypass the CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate CSRF protection: The primary vulnerability is the insufficient check for the Content-Type header, allowing requests with a missing or malformed header to pass through the security check.
- Improper handling of content-type header variations: The check was not robust, failing to consider variations in the header string (case sensitivity, parameters, etc.).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Creation of arbitrary resources: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create resources on the target server via CSRF. In the example provided, it's demonstrated that the attacker can upload a text file using a crafted HTML page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Cross-site request forgery: The attack is achieved by tricking a user's browser into sending a POST request to the vulnerable server while the user is authenticated to it. This can be done by embedding malicious code within a page visited by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to visit a malicious page, and the target server must be running a vulnerable version of Apache Jackrabbit.
- The attacker does not require direct access to the server, only the ability to send requests to it from the victim's browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a full exploit example using HTML and Javascript to generate a CSRF attack and create a resource on the server.
- The fix involves including null content type in the list of rejected content types, and correctly handling content-type variations
- The issue was initially resolved by disabling CSRF checking for POST requests which lead to a follow-up issue (JCR-4009) to properly fix the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Apache Jackrabbit from 2.4.5 to 2.13.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Lukas Reschke.
