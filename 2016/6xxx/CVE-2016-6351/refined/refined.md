Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the QEMU's emulation of the 53C9X Fast SCSI Controller (FSC). Specifically, it's an out-of-bounds write access issue that occurs during DMA read operations into the ESP command buffer (`s->cmdbuf`).
*   The `s->cmdbuf` area was not large enough to handle transfers larger than 16 bytes in the `esp_do_dma()` function, resulting in writes past the intended buffer boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary weakness is the ability to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Insufficient buffer size:** The command buffer (`s->cmdbuf`) was not sized to accommodate the maximum command size, allowing for overflow during DMA operations.
*   **Lack of bounds checking:** There was a lack of proper input validation or bounds checking on the length of data being transferred, which exacerbated the out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service of the virtualized environment.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the host system with the privileges of the QEMU process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest-to-Host:** The attack vector is from within the guest operating system to the host machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User in Guest OS:** An attacker needs to have a privileged user account (e.g., root) inside the virtualized guest operating system.
*   **Ability to trigger DMA:** The attacker must be able to initiate SCSI DMA operations within the guest that exceed the 16 byte buffer limit.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `esp_do_dma()` function, which handles DMA transfers.
*   The fix involves increasing the `cmdbuf` buffer size to 32 bytes to accommodate the maximum command size and adding a check on length to prevent out-of-bounds access.
*   This issue affected Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 as well as Debian 8.

**Summary**

The vulnerability stems from improper bounds checking in QEMU's 53C9X Fast SCSI controller emulation, specifically during DMA operations. A privileged user within a guest VM can trigger an out-of-bounds write by sending a SCSI command that transfers more than 16 bytes of data into the command buffer, leading to a crash or potential arbitrary code execution on the host.
