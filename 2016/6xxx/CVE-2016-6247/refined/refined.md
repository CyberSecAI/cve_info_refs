{
  "CVE-2016-6247": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "When the unmount system call is called with the MNT_DOOMED flag set, it does not sync vnodes. This can lead to a condition where there is still a vnode on the mnt_vnodelist.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of MNT_DOOMED flag without proper vnode syncing, leading to a dangling vnode on mnt_vnodelist.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Kernel panic.",
    "Attack vectors": "Calling the unmount system call with the MNT_DOOMED flag set.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Root user, or a user on systems with kern.usermount set to true."
  }
