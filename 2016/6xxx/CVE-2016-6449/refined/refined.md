Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6449

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the system management of certain FireAMP system processes within Cisco FireAMP Connector Endpoint software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insufficient access control on system management processes of the FireAMP Connector Endpoint software. This allows an authenticated, local attacker to stop specific protected FireAMP processes without requiring a password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Stopping critical FireAMP processes can lead to a denial-of-service condition, rendering the software ineffective.
-  **Loss of Security Features:**  Certain security features provided by the software may no longer be available, compromising the overall security posture.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable FireAMP Connector Endpoint software is installed.
-  **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must be a local user with valid credentials on the target system.
-   No specific technical expertise is explicitly mentioned beyond the ability to stop processes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 and a temporal score of 3.6.
-  The exploit is considered to be functional, indicating that exploit code is available and works in most situations.
-  A complete vendor solution (official fix) is available.
-  Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
-  The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Viktor Minin of Citadel.
