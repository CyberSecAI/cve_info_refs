Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-6938:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue.
- It occurs during the processing of XObject streams in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
- The root cause is the failure to properly validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: This type of vulnerability arises when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory is still used, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- The code executes within the context of the current process (i.e. the Acrobat Reader DC process).
- This could lead to complete control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- User interaction required: The user must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious PDF file crafted by the attacker to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF or a link to a malicious web page to the targeted user.
- They do not need to be on the same network as the target.
