Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an access violation (read beyond memory) when processing maliciously crafted TLS records with CBC mode cipher suites in TLS 1.1 and 1.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists when handling TLS records.
- The vulnerability occurs specifically with TLS cipher suites using CBC mode in TLS 1.1 and 1.2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to an access violation (read beyond memory). This could result in a crash or potentially expose sensitive information from the process's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through maliciously crafted TLS records.
- The attacker must be able to send a malformed TLS record to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send malicious TLS records to the server.
- They need to be able to create or modify a TLS record to exploit this vulnerability.
