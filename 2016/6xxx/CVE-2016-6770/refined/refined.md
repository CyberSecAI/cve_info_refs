Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Android Framework APIs, specifically how isolated processes obtain system service binders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Binder Access:** Isolated processes are only intended to receive a `PackageManager` binder during startup and configuration, but not other preloaded service binders. The vulnerability allows these processes to access system functions beyond their intended access level.
*   **Bypass of Restrictions:** This flaw enables a local malicious application to bypass security restrictions imposed on constrained processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A local malicious application can gain access to system functions and capabilities that are normally beyond its reach. This could potentially be used to compromise the device further.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** An attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the device to run the application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity because it's a local bypass of restrictions on a constrained process.
*   The fix for this issue is available in AOSP via the commit [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/2c61c57ac53cbb270b4e76b9d04465f8a3f6eadc](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/2c61c57ac53cbb270b4e76b9d04465f8a3f6eadc)
*   The issue affects Android versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, and 7.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported on July 16, 2016.

The provided content includes a commit message that further clarifies the vulnerability:
> Isolated processes don't get precached system service binders. More specifically, they get a PackageManager binder - necessary for Android process startup and configuration - but none of the other usual preloaded service binders. Bug 30202228 Change-Id: I3810649f504cd631665ec338a83d2e54d41ad05

This message highlights that the issue is that isolated processes are improperly receiving more binders than they should, specifically the preloaded service binders. This aligns with the extracted information that the issue allows them to access functions beyond their access level.
