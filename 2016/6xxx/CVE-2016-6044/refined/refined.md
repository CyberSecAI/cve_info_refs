- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Operations Center allows an authenticated attacker to enable or disable the application's REST API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control over the REST API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can violate security policy by enabling or disabling the REST API.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated with low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
