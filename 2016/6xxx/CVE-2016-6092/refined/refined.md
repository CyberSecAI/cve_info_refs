- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the storage of user credentials in clear text within IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User credentials are stored in plain text, which can be read by a local user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to other integrated systems by obtaining the clear text passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user can read the plain text user credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the system where IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager is installed is required.
