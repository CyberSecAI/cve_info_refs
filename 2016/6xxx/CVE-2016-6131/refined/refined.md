Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6131:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the libiberty demangler, specifically how it handles mangled type strings containing self-references or cyclic references.  The demangler "remembers" mangled types for later reference. When a mangled string contains a reference back to itself, or to a type that eventually references the original type, it causes infinite recursion during the demangling process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Infinite recursion:** The core issue is the lack of cycle detection when demangling "remembered" type names. This allows for a specifically crafted mangled name to cause infinite recursion.
- **Stack overflow:** Due to the infinite recursion, the function call stack grows until it overflows, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the application that uses the vulnerable demangler library (e.g., Valgrind, GDB, Binutils, etc.). This makes the tool unusable for analyzing or reverse-engineering binaries.
- **Potential for code execution:** While not explicitly demonstrated, the GDB analysis classifies the stack overflow as "exploitable" meaning it is theoretically possible that by controlling the stack, an attacker could gain code execution, though not confirmed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted binaries:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a binary with a specifically crafted mangled type string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to influence input:** The attacker must be able to provide the crafted mangled name to the vulnerable demangler. This can be achieved by modifying a program binary, so that when it is analyzed or reverse-engineered by tools using the demangler, the vulnerability is triggered.

**Technical Details:**

- **Affected functions:** The vulnerability is triggered within `demangle_signature`, `do_arg`, and `demangle_args` in `cplus-dem.c`. The `do_type` function was modified to check for and prevent cyclic references.
- **Mitigation:** The fix introduces a stack (`work->proctypevec`) to track the types that are currently being demangled.  Before demangling a "remembered" type, the code now checks if that type is already being processed. If so, the demangling is aborted and marked as not successful, thus breaking the cycle. New functions `push_processed_type` and `pop_processed_type` were added to manage the stack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered using a fuzzer, a more efficient version of AFL called AFLFast.
- The vulnerability affects various tools that use the libiberty demangler, such as GDB, Valgrind, and Binutils.
- A patch was developed and applied to the trunk version of GCC.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling demangling in affected tools.
