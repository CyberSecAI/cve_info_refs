Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6422:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) share access control list (ACL) functionality within Cisco IOS Software. Specifically, when the `mls acl tcam share-acl` command is configured, and a port access control list (PACL) containing specific operators or keywords is applied to more than eight interfaces. This configuration causes the device to not apply filters with those operators or keywords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of certain operators or keywords (greater than, less than, tcp flags, established, range) within PACLs when TCAM sharing is enabled and applied to a large number of interfaces.
- Bypassing of configured access control entries (ACEs) within PACLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass access control entries (ACEs) in a port access control list (PACL).
- This could allow unauthorized traffic to pass through the affected interfaces.
- Specifically, if the PACL is intended to filter established TCP connections, the vulnerability will allow all TCP traffic, ignoring the `established` keyword.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack via network traffic.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- Exploitation occurs through network traffic targeting interfaces with misconfigured PACLs

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to one or more interfaces of a vulnerable Cisco device.
- No prior access or authentication is required

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `mls acl tcam share-acl` command is configured.
- The PACL must include an ACE that contains a greater than operator, a less than operator, a tcp flag, the established keyword, or the range keyword.
- The PACL must be applied to more than eight interfaces.
- The PACL is not bypassed completely; only the ACEs with the affected operators/keywords are not applied.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Base) and 3.6 (Temporal).
