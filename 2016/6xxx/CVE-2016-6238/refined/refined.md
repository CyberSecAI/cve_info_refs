Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-6238:

**CVE-2016-6238:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A global buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `ProbabilityTablesBase::set_quantization_table` function within the `src/vp8/model/model.hh` file. This function is called during the VP8 encoding process within Lepton.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a global-buffer-overflow read, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a crash of the application due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted JPEG image that triggers the vulnerable code path during the decoding and re-encoding process of the Lepton library.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG file as input to the Lepton application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs at `src/vp8/model/model.hh:233` within the `ProbabilityTablesBase::set_quantization_table` function.
*   The specific read occurs when the function attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   The AddressSanitizer output provides the location of the over-read as `0x0000008cad0a`, which is 54 bytes to the left of `chroma_debug_height` and 6 bytes to the right of `raw_decoded_fp_Y` in `src/vp8/util/debug.cc`.
*   The vulnerable code is triggered within the VP8ComponentEncoder `vp8_full_encoder` function at `src/lepton/vp8_encoder.cc:465`
*   The vulnerable code is called when writing a ujpg format image during the lepton process `src/lepton/jpgcoder.cc:3660`.

This information is more detailed than the original CVE description, which just assigns the CVE ID to the buffer over-read.
