Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6724:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Input Manager Service, specifically during the parsing of IME (Input Method Editor) meta data. It appears that exceptions during parsing were not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper exception handling in the Input Manager Service when parsing IME meta data. This can lead to a crash loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability to cause the device to continually reboot, effectively rendering the device unusable until a factory reset is performed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local malicious application. An attacker must have the ability to install and execute an application on the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to install a malicious application on the Android device. This would typically require user interaction (to grant installation permissions) or some other vulnerability to install the malicious application without explicit permission.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves catching all exceptions during parsing of IME meta data to prevent the device from entering a crash loop.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity because while it results in a denial of service, it requires a factory reset to fix the device.
- The commit message indicates the fix was cherry-picked from an earlier commit (dddc438e97509a858319e91988908b27085792d6).

In summary, CVE-2016-6724 describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Android Input Manager Service that can be triggered by a malicious local app by providing specially crafted, unparsable input metadata that causes the device to continually reboot.
