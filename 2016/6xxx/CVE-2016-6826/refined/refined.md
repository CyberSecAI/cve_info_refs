- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation when opening compressed email attachments in Huawei AnyMail.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Lack of proper validation of compressed attachment data leading to a crash when malformed data is processed.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation leads to the AnyMail application crashing and exiting.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker crafts a malicious email containing abnormal compressed attachments and sends it to a user's mailbox.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the target user. The user must then attempt to open the malicious attachment in AnyMail for the exploit to be successful.
