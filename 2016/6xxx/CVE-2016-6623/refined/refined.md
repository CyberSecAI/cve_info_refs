Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) issue caused by passing large values to a loop within phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The application does not properly limit the size of values passed to loops, allowing for excessive resource consumption.
*   **Denial of Service:** By sending large values in loops, a malicious user can cause the server to become overloaded and unavailable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can make the server running phpMyAdmin unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
