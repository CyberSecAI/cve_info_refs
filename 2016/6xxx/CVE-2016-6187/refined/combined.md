apparmor: fix oops, validate buffer size in apparmor\_setprocattr()When proc\_pid\_attr\_write() was changed to use memdup\_user apparmor's
(interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always
a single page was violated.
The size test is not strictly speaking needed as proc\_pid\_attr\_write()
will reject anything larger, but for the sake of robustness we can keep
it in.
SMACK and SELinux look safe to me, but somebody else should probably
have a look just in case.
Based on original patch from Vegard Nossum <vegard.nossum@oracle.com>
modified for the case that apparmor provides null termination.

    apparmor: fix oops, validate buffer size in apparmor_setprocattr()

    When proc_pid_attr_write() was changed to use memdup_user apparmor's
    (interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always
    a single page was violated.

    The size test is not strictly speaking needed as proc_pid_attr_write()
    will reject anything larger, but for the sake of robustness we can keep
    it in.

    SMACK and SELinux look safe to me, but somebody else should probably
    have a look just in case.

    Based on original patch from Vegard Nossum <vegard.nossum@oracle.com>
    modified for the case that apparmor provides null termination.

apparmor: fix oops, validate buffer size in apparmor\_setprocattr()

```
When proc_pid_attr_write() was changed to use memdup_user apparmor's
(interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always
a single page was violated.

The size test is not strictly speaking needed as proc_pid_attr_write()
will reject anything larger, but for the sake of robustness we can keep
it in.

SMACK and SELinux look safe to me, but somebody else should probably
have a look just in case.

Based on original patch from Vegard Nossum <vegard.nossum@oracle.com>
modified for the case that apparmor provides null termination.

commit 429cc19dbdce4568f4d3f0da06596c1d4d559f24
Author: Vivek Goyal
Date: Fri Jul 1 10:02:44 2016 -0400
ovl: warn instead of error if d\_type is not supported
commit e7c0b5991dd1be7b6f6dc2b54a15a0f47b64b007 upstream.
overlay needs underlying fs to support d\_type. Recently I put in a
patch in to detect this condition and started failing mount if
underlying fs did not support d\_type.
But this breaks existing configurations over kernel upgrade. Those who
are running docker (partially broken configuration) with xfs not
supporting d\_type, are surprised that after kernel upgrade docker does
not run anymore.
https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/22937#issuecomment-229881315
So instead of erroring out, detect broken configuration and warn
about it. This should allow existing docker setups to continue
working after kernel upgrade.

ovl: Do d\_type check only if work dir creation was successful
commit 21765194cecf2e4514ad75244df459f188140a0f upstream.
d\_type check requires successful creation of workdir as iterates
through work dir and expects work dir to be present in it. If that's
not the case, this check will always return d\_type not supported even
if underlying filesystem might be supporting it.
So don't do this check if work dir creation failed in previous step.

this feature for now until we can ensure that the feature works for
all platforms.

tmpfs: fix regression hang in fallocate undo
commit 7f556567036cb7f89aabe2f0954b08566b4efb53 upstream.
The well-spotted fallocate undo fix is good in most cases, but not when
fallocate failed on the very first page. index 0 then passes lend -1
to shmem\_undo\_range(), and that has two bad effects: (a) that it will
undo every fallocation throughout the file, unrestricted by the current
range; but more importantly (b) it can cause the undo to hang, because
lend -1 is treated as truncation, which makes it keep on retrying until
every page has gone, but those already fully instantiated will never go
away. Big thank you to xfstests generic/269 which demonstrates this.

When fallocate is interrupted it will undo a range that extends one byte
past its range of allocated pages. This can corrupt an in-use page by
zeroing out its first byte. Instead, undo using the inclusive byte
range.

xen/acpi: allow xen-acpi-processor driver to load on Xen 4.7
commit 6f2d9d99213514360034c6d52d2c3919290b3504 upstream.
As of Xen 4.7 PV CPUID doesn't expose either of CPUID[1].ECX[7] and
CPUID[0x80000007].EDX[7] anymore, causing the driver to fail to load on
both Intel and AMD systems. Doing any kind of hardware capability
checks in the driver as a prerequisite was wrong anyway: With the
hypervisor being in charge, all such checking should be done by it. If
ACPI data gets uploaded despite some missing capability, the hypervisor
is free to ignore part or all of that data.
Ditch the entire check\_prereq() function, and do the only valid check
(xen\_initial\_domain()) in the caller in its place.

cifs: dynamic allocation of ntlmssp blob
commit b8da344b74c822e966c6d19d6b2321efe82c5d97 upstream.
In sess\_auth\_rawntlmssp\_authenticate(), the ntlmssp blob is allocated
statically and its size is an "empirical" 5\*sizeof(struct
\_AUTHENTICATE\_MESSAGE) (320B on x86\_64). I don't know where this value
comes from or if it was ever appropriate, but it is currently
insufficient: the user and domain name in UTF16 could take 1kB by
themselves. Because of that, build\_ntlmssp\_auth\_blob() might corrupt
memory (out-of-bounds write). The size of ntlmssp\_blob in
SMB2\_sess\_setup() is too small too (sizeof(struct \_NEGOTIATE\_MESSAGE)
+ 500).
This patch allocates the blob dynamically in
build\_ntlmssp\_auth\_blob().

Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect long after socket reconnect
commit 4fcd1813e6404dd4420c7d12fb483f9320f0bf93 upstream.
Azure server blocks clients that open a socket and don't do anything on it.
In our reconnect scenarios, we can reconnect the tcp session and
detect the socket is available but we defer the negprot and SMB3 session
setup and tree connect reconnection until the next i/o is requested, but
this looks suspicous to some servers who expect SMB3 negprog and session
setup soon after a socket is created.

that are disconnected. A later patch will replay persistent (and

53c700: fix BUG on untagged commands
commit 8beb330044d0d1878c7b92290e91c0b889e92633 upstream.
The untagged command case in the 53c700 driver has been broken since
host wide tags were enabled because the replaced scsi\_find\_tag()
function had a special case for the tag value SCSI\_NO\_TAG to retrieve
sdev->current\_cmnd. The replacement function scsi\_host\_find\_tag() has
no such special case and returns NULL causing untagged commands to
trigger a BUG() in the driver. Inspection shows that the 53c700 is the
only driver using this SCSI\_NO\_TAG case, so a local fix in the driver
suffices to fix this problem globally.

s390: fix test\_fp\_ctl inline assembly contraints
commit bcf4dd5f9ee096bd1510f838dd4750c35df4e38b upstream.
The test\_fp\_ctl function is used to test if a given value is a valid
floating-point control. The inline assembly in test\_fp\_ctl uses an
incorrect constraint for the 'orig\_fpc' variable. If the compiler
chooses the same register for 'fpc' and 'orig\_fpc' the test\_fp\_ctl()
function always returns true. This allows user space to trigger
kernel oopses with invalid floating-point control values on the
signal stack.

scsi: fix race between simultaneous decrements of ->host\_failed
commit 72d8c36ec364c82bf1bf0c64dfa1041cfaf139f7 upstream.
sas\_ata\_strategy\_handler() adds the works of the ata error handler to
system\_unbound\_wq. This workqueue asynchronously runs work items, so the
ata error handler will be performed concurrently on different CPUs. In
this case, ->host\_failed will be decreased simultaneously in
scsi\_eh\_finish\_cmd() on different CPUs, and become abnormal.
It will lead to permanently inequality between ->host\_failed and
->host\_busy, and scsi error handler thread won't start running. IO
errors after that won't be handled.
Since all scmds must have been handled in the strategy handler, just
remove the decrement in scsi\_eh\_finish\_cmd() and zero ->host\_busy after
the strategy handler to fix this race.

ovl: handle ATTR\_KILL\*
commit b99c2d913810e56682a538c9f2394d76fca808f8 upstream.
Before 4bacc9c9234c ("overlayfs: Make f\_path...") file->f\_path pointed to
the underlying file, hence suid/sgid removal on write worked fine.
After that patch file->f\_path pointed to the overlay file, and the file
mode bits weren't copied to overlay\_inode->i\_mode. So the suid/sgid
removal simply stopped working.
The fix is to copy the mode bits, but then ovl\_setattr() needs to clear
ATTR\_MODE to avoid the BUG() in notify\_change(). So do this first, then in
the next patch copy the mode.

ARM: mvebu: fix HW I/O coherency related deadlocks
commit c5379ba8fccd99d5f99632c789f0393d84a57805 upstream.
Until now, our understanding for HW I/O coherency to work on the
Cortex-A9 based Marvell SoC was that only the PCIe regions should be
mapped strongly-ordered. However, we were still encountering some
deadlocks, especially when testing the CESA crypto engine. After
checking with the HW designers, it was concluded that all the MMIO
registers should be mapped as strongly ordered for the HW I/O coherency
mechanism to work properly.
This fixes some easy to reproduce deadlocks with the CESA crypto engine
driver (dmcrypt on a sufficiently large disk partition).

the notification itself is mostly harmless, it may potentially be

commit a8ff48cb70835f48de5703052760312019afea55 upstream.
The chmap ctls assigned to PCM streams are freed in the PCM disconnect
callback. However, since the disconnect callback isn't called when
the card gets freed before registering, the chmap ctls may still be
left assigned. They are eventually freed together with other ctls,
but it may cause an Oops at pcm\_chmap\_ctl\_private\_free(), as the
function refers to the assigned PCM stream, while the PCM objects have
been already freed beforehand.
The fix is to free the chmap ctls also at PCM free callback, not only
at PCM disconnect.

ALSA: timer: Fix negative queue usage by racy accesses
commit 3fa6993fef634e05d200d141a85df0b044572364 upstream.
The user timer tu->qused counter may go to a negative value when
multiple concurrent reads are performed since both the check and the
decrement of tu->qused are done in two individual locked contexts.
This results in bogus read outs, and the endless loop in the
user-space side.
The fix is to move the decrement of the tu->qused counter into the
same spinlock context as the zero-check of the counter.

hwmon: (dell-smm) Cache fan\_type() calls and change fan detection
commit 5ce91714b0d8c0a3ff9b858966721f508351cf4c upstream.
On more Dell machines (e.g. Dell Precision M3800) fan\_type() call is too
expensive (CPU is too long in SMM mode) and cause kernel to hang. This is
bug in Dell SMM or BIOS.
This patch caches type for each fan (as it should not change) and changes
the way how fan presense is detected. First it try function fan\_status()
as was before commit f989e55452c7 ("i8k: Add support for fan labels"). And
if that fails fallback to fan\_type(). \*\_status() functions can fail in case
fan is not currently accessible (e.g. present on GPU which is currently
turned off).

hwmon: (dell-smm) Disallow fan\_type() calls on broken machines
commit 2744d2fde00dc8bcc3679eb72c81a63058e90faa upstream.
Some Dell machines have especially broken SMM or BIOS which cause that once
fan\_type() is called then CPU fan speed going randomly up and down. And for
fixing this behaviour reboot is required.
So this patch creates fan\_type blacklist of affected Dell machines and
disallow fan\_type() call on them to prevent that erratic behaviour.
Old blacklist which disabled loading driver on some machines added in
commits a4b45b25f18d ("hwmon: (dell-smm) Blacklist Dell Studio XPS 8100")
and 6220f4ebd7b4 ("hwmon: (dell-smm) Blacklist Dell Studio XPS 8000") were

hwmon: (dell-smm) Restrict fan control and serial number to CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN by default
commit 7613663cc186f8f3c50279390ddc60286758001c upstream.
For security reasons ordinary user must not be able to control fan speed
via /proc/i8k by default. Some malicious software running under "nobody"
user could be able to turn fan off and cause HW problems. So this patch
changes default value of "restricted" parameter to 1.
Also restrict reading of DMI\_PRODUCT\_SERIAL from /proc/i8k via "restricted"
parameter. It is because non root user cannot read DMI\_PRODUCT\_SERIAL from
sysfs file /sys/class/dmi/id/product\_serial.
Old non secure behaviour of file /proc/i8k can be achieved by loading this
module with "restricted" parameter set to 0.
Note that this patch has effects only for kernels compiled with CONFIG\_I8K
and only for file /proc/i8k. Hwmon interface provided by this driver was
not changed and root access for setting fan speed was needed also before.

tty/vt/keyboard: fix OOB access in do\_compute\_shiftstate()
commit 510cccb5b0c8868a2b302a0ab524da7912da648b upstream.
The size of individual keymap in drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c is NR\_KEYS,
which is currently 256, whereas number of keys/buttons in input device (and
therefor in key\_down) is much larger - KEY\_CNT - 768, and that can cause
out-of-bound access when we do
sym = U(key\_maps[0][k]);
with large 'k'.
To fix it we should not attempt iterating beyond smaller of NR\_KEYS and
KEY\_CNT.
Also while at it let's switch to for\_each\_set\_bit() instead of open-coding
it.

tty: vt: Fix soft lockup in fbcon cursor blink timer.
commit 1b45996d2ebf9680ccd0db875fc668aa025f40fd upstream.
We are getting somewhat random soft lockups with this signature:
[ 86.992215] [] el1\_irq+0xa0/0x10c
[ 86.997082] [] cursor\_timer\_handler+0x30/0x54

[ 87.024458] [] \_\_handle\_domain\_irq+0x98/0xfc
[ 87.030278] [] gic\_handle\_irq+0x94/0x190
This is caused by the vt visual\_init() function calling into
fbcon\_init() with a vc\_cur\_blink\_ms value of zero. This is a
transient condition, as it is later set to a non-zero value. But, if
the timer happens to expire while the blink rate is zero, it goes into
an endless loop, and we get soft lockup.
The fix is to initialize vc\_cur\_blink\_ms before calling the con\_init()
function.

Currently the ad7266 driver treats any failure to get vref as though the
regulator were not present but this means that if probe deferral is
triggered the driver will act as though the regulator were not present.
Instead only use the internal reference if we explicitly got -ENODEV which
is what is returned for absent regulators.

iio:ad7266: Fix support for optional regulators
commit e5511c816e5ac4909bdd38e85ac344e2b9b8e984 upstream.
The ad7266 driver attempts to support deciding between the use of internal
and external power supplies by checking to see if an error is returned when
requesting the regulator. This doesn't work with the current code since the
driver uses a normal regulator\_get() which is for non-optional supplies
and so assumes that if a regulator is not provided by the platform then
this is a bug in the platform integration and so substitutes a dummy
regulator. Use regulator\_get\_optional() instead which indicates to the
framework that the regulator may be absent and provides a dummy regulator
instead.

commit 6b7f4e25f3309f106a5c7ff42c8231494cf285d3 upstream.
All regulator\_get() variants return either a pointer to a regulator or an
ERR\_PTR() so testing for NULL makes no sense and may lead to bugs if we
use NULL as a valid regulator. Fix this by using IS\_ERR() as expected.

The save/restore buffers for VC state is first composed of a 2-byte control

This causes unaligned accesses which trap on platform such as sparc.
This is easy to fix by simply moving the buffer pointer forward by 4 bytes
instead of 2 after dealing with the control register. The length

drm/vmwgfx: Delay pinning fbdev framebuffer until after mode set
commit d5f1a291e32309324a8c481ed84b5c118d1360ea upstream.
For the Screen Object display unit, we need to reserve a
guest-invisible region equal to the size of the framebuffer for
the host. This region can only be reserved in VRAM, whereas
the guest-visible framebuffer can be reserved in either VRAM or
GMR.
As such priority should be given to the guest-invisible
region otherwise in a limited VRAM situation, we can fail to
allocate this region.
This patch makes it so that vmw\_sou\_backing\_alloc() is called
before the framebuffer is pinned.

drm/vmwgfx: Check pin count before attempting to move a buffer
commit 4ed7e2242b637bc4af0416e4aa9f945db30fb44a upstream.
In certain scenarios, e.g. when fbdev is enabled, we can get into
a situation where a vmw\_framebuffer\_pin() is called on a buffer
that is already pinned.
When this happens, ttm\_bo\_validate() will unintentially remove the
TTM\_PL\_FLAG\_NO\_EVICT flag, thus unpinning it, and leaving no way
to actually pin the buffer again.
To prevent this, if a buffer is already pinned, then instead of
calling ttm\_bo\_validate(), just make sure the proposed placement is
compatible with the existing placement.

drm/vmwgfx: Work around mode set failure in 2D VMs
commit 7c20d213dd3cd6295bf9162730e7a368af957854 upstream.
In a low-memory 2D VM, fbdev can take up a large percentage of
available memory, making them unavailable for other DRM clients.
Since we do not take fbdev into account when filtering modes,
we end up claiming to support more modes than we actually do.
As a result, users get a black screen when setting a mode too
large for current available memory. In a low-memory VM
configuration, users can get a black screen for a mode as low
as 1024x768.
The current mode filtering mechanism keys off of
SVGA\_REG\_SUGGESTED\_GBOBJECT\_MEM\_SIZE\_KB, i.e. the maximum amount
of surface memory we have. Since this value is a performance
suggestion, not a hard limit, and since there should not be much
of a performance impact for a 2D VM, rather than filtering out
more modes, we will just allow ourselves to exceed the SVGA's
performance suggestion.
Also changed assumed bpp to 32 from 16 to make sure we can
actually support all the modes listed.

regression is they will likely get a black screen after a software

avoid taking the struct\_mutex along the free path). However, the CMA GEM
helpers were still calling driver->gem\_free\_object directly, now NULL,
and promptly dying on the fancy new lockless drivers. Oops.
Robert Foss bisected this to b82caafcf2303 (drm/vc4: Use lockless gem BO
free callback) on his vc4 device, but that just serves as an enabler for
9f0ba539d13ae (drm/gem: support BO freeing without dev->struct\_mutex).

drm: make drm\_atomic\_set\_mode\_prop\_for\_crtc() more reliable
commit 6709887c448d1cff51b52d09763c7b834ea5f0be upstream.
drm\_atomic\_set\_mode\_prop\_for\_crtc() does not clear the state->mode, so
old data may be left there when a new mode is set, possibly causing odd
issues.
This patch improves the situation by always clearing the state->mode
first.

drm: add missing drm\_mode\_set\_crtcinfo call
commit b201e743f42d143f4bcdcb14587caf7cb1d99229 upstream.
When setting mode via MODE\_ID property,
drm\_atomic\_set\_mode\_prop\_for\_crtc() does not call
drm\_mode\_set\_crtcinfo() which possibly causes:
"[drm:drm\_calc\_timestamping\_constants [drm]] \*ERROR\* crtc 32: Can't
calculate constants, dotclock = 0!"
Whether the error is seen depends on the previous data in state->mode,
as state->mode is not cleared when setting new mode.
This patch adds drm\_mode\_set\_crtcinfo() call to
drm\_mode\_convert\_umode(), which is called in both legacy and atomic
paths. This should be fine as there's no reason to call
drm\_mode\_convert\_umode() without also setting the crtc related fields.
drm\_mode\_set\_crtcinfo() is removed from the legacy drm\_mode\_setcrtc() as
that is no longer needed.

drm/i915: Refresh cached DP port register value on resume
commit 664a84d2c77cbff2945ed7f96d08afbba42b6293 upstream.
During hibernation the cached DP port register value will be left with
whatever value we have there when we create the hibernation image.
Currently that means the port (and eDP PLL) will be off in the cached
value. However when we resume there is no guarantee that the value
in the actual register will match the cached value. If i915 isn't
loaded in the kernel that loads the hibernation image, the port may
well be on (eg. left on by the BIOS). The encoder state readout
does the right thing in this case and updates our encoder state
to reflect the actual hardware state. However the post-resume modeset
will then use the stale cached port register value in
intel\_dp\_link\_down() and potentially confuse the hardware.
This was caught by the following assert
WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 5288 at ../drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel\_dp.c:2184 assert\_edp\_pll+0x99/0xa0 [i915]
eDP PLL state assertion failure (expected on, current off)
on account of the eDP PLL getting prematurely turned off when
shutting down the port, since the DP\_PLL\_ENABLE bit wasn't set
in the cached register value.
Presumably I introduced this problem in
commit 6fec76628333 ("drm/i915: Use intel\_dp->DP in eDP PLL setup")
as before that we didn't update the cached value after shuttting the
port down. That's assuming the port got enabled at least once prior
to hibernating. If that didn't happen then the cached value would
still have been totally out of sync with reality (eg. first boot w/o
eDP on, then hibernate, and then resume with eDP on).
So, let's fix this properly and refresh the cached register value from
the hardware register during resume.
DDI platforms shouldn't use the cached value during port disable at
least, so shouldn't have this particular issue. They might still have
issues if we skip the initial modeset and then try to retrain the link
or something. But untangling this DP vs. DDI mess is a bigger topic,
so let's jut punt on DDI for now.

drm/i915/fbc: Disable on HSW by default for now
commit 1e3fa0acfec677e915d7de5ac6e1f18cfa4f805b upstream.
>From https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=96461 :
This was kind of a difficult bug to track down. If you're using a
Haswell system running GNOME and you have fbc completely enabled and
working, playing videos can result in video artifacts. Steps to
reproduce:
- Run GNOME
- Ensure FBC is enabled and active
- Download a movie, I used the ogg version of Big Buck Bunny for this
- Run `gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location='some\_movie.ogg' ! decodebin !
glimagesink` in a terminal
- Watch for about over a minute, you'll see small horizontal lines go
down the screen.
For the time being, disable FBC for Haswell by default.
Stefan Richter reported kernel freezes (no video artifacts) when fbc
is on. (E3-1245 v3 with HD P4600; openbox and some KDE and LXDE
applications, thread begins at https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/26/813).
We also got reports from Steven Honeyman on openbox+roxterm.

drm/i915/ilk: Don't disable SSC source if it's in use
commit 476490a945e1f0f6bd58e303058d2d8ca93a974c upstream.
Thanks to Ville Syrjälä for pointing me towards the cause of this issue.
Unfortunately one of the sideaffects of having the refclk for a DPLL set
to SSC is that as long as it's set to SSC, the GPU will prevent us from
powering down any of the pipes or transcoders using it. A couple of
BIOSes enable SSC in both PCH\_DREF\_CONTROL and in the DPLL
configurations. This causes issues on the first modeset, since we don't
expect SSC to be left on and as a result, can't successfully power down
the pipes or the transcoders using it. Here's an example from this Dell
OptiPlex 990:

Later modesets succeed since they reset the DPLL's configuration anyway,
but this is enough to get stuck with a big fat warning in dmesg.
A better solution would be to add refcounts for the SSC source, but for
now leaving the source clock on should suffice.
Changes since v4:
- Fix calculation of final for systems with LVDS panels (fixes BUG() on
CI test suite)
Changes since v3:
- Move temp variable into loop
- Move checks for using\_ssc\_source to after we've figured out has\_ck505
- Add using\_ssc\_source to debug output
Changes since v2:
- Fix debug output for when we disable the CPU source
Changes since v1:
- Leave the SSC source clock on instead of just shutting it off on all
of the DPLL configurations.

drm/amdkfd: unbind only existing processes
commit 121b78e679ee3ffab780115e260b2775d0cc1f73 upstream.
When unbinding a process from a device (initiated by amd\_iommu\_v2), the
driver needs to make sure that process still exists in the process table.
There is a possibility that amdkfd's own notifier handler -
kfd\_process\_notifier\_release() - was called before the unbind function
and it already removed the process from the process table.
v2:
Because there can be only one process with the specified pasid, and
because \*p can't be NULL inside the hash\_for\_each\_rcu macro, it is more
reasonable to just put the whole code inside the if statement that
compares the pasid value. That way, when we exit hash\_for\_each\_rcu, we
simply exit the function as well.

drm/radeon: fix asic initialization for virtualized environments
commit 05082b8bbd1a0ffc74235449c4b8930a8c240f85 upstream.
When executing in a PCI passthrough based virtuzliation environment, the
hypervisor will usually attempt to send a PCIe bus reset signal to the
ASIC when the VM reboots. In this scenario, the card is not correctly
initialized, but we still consider it to be posted. Therefore, in a
passthrough based environemnt we should always post the card to guarantee
it is in a good state for driver initialization.

btrfs: account for non-CoW'd blocks in btrfs\_abort\_transaction
commit 64c12921e11b3a0c10d088606e328c58e29274d8 upstream.
The test for !trans->blocks\_used in btrfs\_abort\_transaction is
insufficient to determine whether it's safe to drop the transaction
handle on the floor. btrfs\_cow\_block, informed by should\_cow\_block,
can return blocks that have already been CoW'd in the current
transaction. trans->blocks\_used is only incremented for new block
allocations. If an operation overlaps the blocks in the current
transaction entirely and must abort the transaction, we'll happily
let it clean up the trans handle even though it may have modified
the blocks and will commit an incomplete operation.
In the long-term, I'd like to do closer tracking of when the fs
is actually modified so we can still recover as gracefully as possible,
but that approach will need some discussion. In the short term,
since this is the only code using trans->blocks\_used, let's just
switch it to a bool indicating whether any blocks were used and set
it when should\_cow\_block returns false.

percpu: fix synchronization between synchronous map extension and chunk destruction
commit 6710e594f71ccaad8101bc64321152af7cd9ea28 upstream.
For non-atomic allocations, pcpu\_alloc() can try to extend the area
map synchronously after dropping pcpu\_lock; however, the extension
wasn't synchronized against chunk destruction and the chunk might get
freed while extension is in progress.
This patch fixes the bug by putting most of non-atomic allocations
under pcpu\_alloc\_mutex to synchronize against pcpu\_balance\_work which
is responsible for async chunk management including destruction.

percpu: fix synchronization between chunk->map\_extend\_work and chunk destruction
commit 4f996e234dad488e5d9ba0858bc1bae12eff82c3 upstream.
Atomic allocations can trigger async map extensions which is serviced
by chunk->map\_extend\_work. pcpu\_balance\_work which is responsible for
destroying idle chunks wasn't synchronizing properly against
chunk->map\_extend\_work and may end up freeing the chunk while the work
item is still in flight.
This patch fixes the bug by rolling async map extension operations
into pcpu\_balance\_work.

af\_unix: fix hard linked sockets on overlay
commit eb0a4a47ae89aaa0674ab3180de6a162f3be2ddf upstream.
Overlayfs uses separate inodes even in the case of hard links on the
underlying filesystems. This is a problem for AF\_UNIX socket
implementation which indexes sockets based on the inode. This resulted in
hard linked sockets not working.
The fix is to use the real, underlying inode.
Test case follows:
-- ovl-sock-test.c --
#include
#include
#include
#include
#define SOCK "test-sock"
#define SOCK2 "test-sock2"
int main(void)
{
int fd, fd2;
struct sockaddr\_un addr = {
.sun\_family = AF\_UNIX,
.sun\_path = SOCK,
};
struct sockaddr\_un addr2 = {
.sun\_family = AF\_UNIX,
.sun\_path = SOCK2,
};
unlink(SOCK);
unlink(SOCK2);
if ((fd = socket(AF\_UNIX, SOCK\_STREAM, 0)) == -1)
err(1, "socket");
if (bind(fd, (struct sockaddr \*) &addr, sizeof(addr)) == -1)
err(1, "bind");
if (listen(fd, 0) == -1)
err(1, "listen");
if (link(SOCK, SOCK2) == -1)

arm64: kernel: Save and restore UAO and addr\_limit on exception entry
commit e19a6ee2460bdd0d0055a6029383422773f9999a upstream.
If we take an exception while at EL1, the exception handler inherits
the original context's addr\_limit and PSTATE.UAO values. To be consistent
always reset addr\_limit and PSTATE.UAO on (re-)entry to EL1. This
prevents accidental re-use of the original context's addr\_limit.
Based on a similar patch for arm from Russell King.

arm64: mm: remove page\_mapping check in \_\_sync\_icache\_dcache
commit 20c27a4270c775d7ed661491af8ac03264d60fc6 upstream.
\_\_sync\_icache\_dcache unconditionally skips the cache maintenance for
anonymous pages, under the assumption that flushing is only required in
the presence of D-side aliases [see 7249b79f6b4cc ("arm64: Do not flush
the D-cache for anonymous pages")].
Unfortunately, this breaks migration of anonymous pages holding
self-modifying code, where userspace cannot be reasonably expected to
reissue maintenance instructions in response to a migration.
This patch fixes the problem by removing the broken page\_mapping(page)
check from the cache syncing code, otherwise we may end up fetching and
executing stale instructions from the PoU.

arm64: fix dump\_instr when PAN and UAO are in use
commit c5cea06be060f38e5400d796e61cfc8c36e52924 upstream.
If the kernel is set to show unhandled signals, and a user task does not
handle a SIGILL as a result of an instruction abort, we will attempt to
log the offending instruction with dump\_instr before killing the task.
We use dump\_instr to log the encoding of the offending userspace
instruction. However, dump\_instr is also used to dump instructions from
kernel space, and internally always switches to KERNEL\_DS before dumping
the instruction with get\_user. When both PAN and UAO are in use, reading
a user instruction via get\_user while in KERNEL\_DS will result in a
permission fault, which leads to an Oops.
As we have regs corresponding to the context of the original instruction
abort, we can inspect this and only flip to KERNEL\_DS if the original
abort was taken from the kernel, avoiding this issue. At the same time,
remove the redundant (and incorrect) comments regarding the order
dump\_mem and dump\_instr are called in.

drm/nouveau/Revert "drm/nouveau/device/pci: set as non-CPU-coherent on ARM64"
commit 539aae6e3af97c7ec1602ff23e805f2852c2611c upstream.
This reverts commit 1733a2ad36741b1812cf8b3f3037c28d0af53f50.
There is apparently something amiss with the way the TTM code handles
DMA buffers, which the above commit was attempting to work around for
arm64 systems with non-coherent PCI. Unfortunately, this completely
breaks systems \*with\* coherent PCI (which appear to be the majority).
Booting a plain arm64 defconfig + CONFIG\_DRM + CONFIG\_DRM\_NOUVEAU on
a machine with a PCI GPU having coherent dma\_map\_ops (in this case a
7600GT card plugged into an ARM Juno board) results in a fatal crash:

ipmi: Remove smi\_msg from waiting\_rcv\_msgs list before handle\_one\_recv\_msg()
commit ae4ea9a2460c7fee2ae8feeb4dfe96f5f6c3e562 upstream.
Commit 7ea0ed2b5be8 ("ipmi: Make the message handler easier to use for
SMI interfaces") changed handle\_new\_recv\_msgs() to call handle\_one\_recv\_msg()
for a smi\_msg while the smi\_msg is still connected to waiting\_rcv\_msgs list.
That could lead to following list corruption problems:
1) low-level function treats smi\_msg as not connected to list
handle\_one\_recv\_msg() could end up calling smi\_send(), which
assumes the msg is not connected to list.
For example, the following sequence could corrupt list by
doing list\_add\_tail() for the entry still connected to other list.
handle\_new\_recv\_msgs()
msg = list\_entry(waiting\_rcv\_msgs)
handle\_one\_recv\_msg(msg)
handle\_ipmb\_get\_msg\_cmd(msg)
smi\_send(msg)
spin\_lock(xmit\_msgs\_lock)
list\_add\_tail(msg)
spin\_unlock(xmit\_msgs\_lock)
2) race between multiple handle\_new\_recv\_msgs() instances
handle\_new\_recv\_msgs() once releases waiting\_rcv\_msgs\_lock before calling
handle\_one\_recv\_msg() then retakes the lock and list\_del() it.
If others call handle\_new\_recv\_msgs() during the window shown below
list\_del() will be done twice for the same smi\_msg.
handle\_new\_recv\_msgs()
spin\_lock(waiting\_rcv\_msgs\_lock)
msg = list\_entry(waiting\_rcv\_msgs)
spin\_unlock(waiting\_rcv\_msgs\_lock)
|
| handle\_one\_recv\_msg(msg)

drm/fsl-dcu: use flat regmap cache
commit ce492b3b8f99cf9d2f807ec22d8805c996a09503 upstream.
Using flat regmap cache instead of RB-tree to avoid the following
lockdep warning on driver load:
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:2755 lockdep\_trace\_alloc+0x15c/0x160()
DEBUG\_LOCKS\_WARN\_ON(irqs\_disabled\_flags(flags))
The RB-tree regmap cache needs to allocate new space on first
writes. However, allocations in an atomic context (e.g. when a
spinlock is held) are not allowed. The function regmap\_write
calls map->lock, which acquires a spinlock in the fast\_io case.
Since the FSL DCU driver uses MMIO, the regmap bus of type
regmap\_mmio is being used which has fast\_io set to true.
Use flat regmap cache and specify max register to be large
enouth to cover all registers available in LS1021a and Vybrids
register space.

apparmor: fix oops, validate buffer size in apparmor\_setprocattr()
commit 30a46a4647fd1df9cf52e43bf467f0d9265096ca upstream.
When proc\_pid\_attr\_write() was changed to use memdup\_user apparmor's
(interface violating) assumption that the setprocattr buffer was always
a single page was violated.
The size test is not strictly speaking needed as proc\_pid\_attr\_write()
will reject anything larger, but for the sake of robustness we can keep
it in.
SMACK and SELinux look safe to me, but somebody else should probably
have a look just in case.
Based on original patch from Vegard Nossum
modified for the case that apparmor provides null termination.

iommu/amd: Fix unity mapping initialization race
commit 522e5cb76d0663c88f96b6a8301451c8efa37207 upstream.
There is a race condition in the AMD IOMMU init code that
causes requested unity mappings to be blocked by the IOMMU
for a short period of time. This results on boot failures
and IO\_PAGE\_FAULTs on some machines.
Fix this by making sure the unity mappings are installed
before all other DMA is blocked.

base: make module\_create\_drivers\_dir race-free
commit 7e1b1fc4dabd6ec8e28baa0708866e13fa93c9b3 upstream.
Modules which register drivers via standard path (driver\_register) in
parallel can cause a warning:
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3492 at ../fs/sysfs/dir.c:31 sysfs\_warn\_dup+0x62/0x80
sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/module/saa7146/drivers'
Modules linked in: hexium\_gemini(+) mxb(+) ...

Call Trace:

[] saa7146\_register\_extension+0x64/0x90 [saa7146]
[] hexium\_init\_module+0x11/0x1000 [hexium\_gemini]
...
As can be (mostly) seen, driver\_register causes this call sequence:
-> bus\_add\_driver
-> module\_add\_driver
-> module\_create\_drivers\_dir
The last one creates "drivers" directory in /sys/module/<...>. When
this is done in parallel, the directory is attempted to be created
twice at the same time.
This can be easily reproduced by loading mxb and hexium\_gemini in
parallel:
while :; do
modprobe mxb &
modprobe hexium\_gemini
wait
rmmod mxb hexium\_gemini saa7146\_vv saa7146
done
saa7146 calls pci\_register\_driver for both mxb and hexium\_gemini,
which means /sys/module/saa7146/drivers is to be created for both of
them.
Fix this by a new mutex in module\_create\_drivers\_dir which makes the
test-and-create "drivers" dir atomic.
I inverted the condition and removed 'return' to avoid multiple
unlocks or a goto.

tracing: Handle NULL formats in hold\_module\_trace\_bprintk\_format()
commit 70c8217acd4383e069fe1898bbad36ea4fcdbdcc upstream.
If a task uses a non constant string for the format parameter in
trace\_printk(), then the trace\_printk\_fmt variable is set to NULL. This
variable is then saved in the \_\_trace\_printk\_fmt section.
The function hold\_module\_trace\_bprintk\_format() checks to see if duplicate
formats are used by modules, and reuses them if so (saves them to the list
if it is new). But this function calls lookup\_format() that does a strcmp()
to the value (which is now NULL) and can cause a kernel oops.
This wasn't an issue till 3debb0a9ddb ("tracing: Fix trace\_printk() to print
when not using bprintk()") which added "\_\_used" to the trace\_printk\_fmt
variable, and before that, the kernel simply optimized it out (no NULL value
was saved).
The fix is simply to handle the NULL pointer in lookup\_format() and have the
caller ignore the value if it was NULL.

Cross-checking the KVM/VMX VMREAD emulation code with the Intel Software
Developper Manual Volume 3C - "VMREAD - Read Field from Virtual-Machine
Control Structure", I found that we're enforcing that the destination
operand is NOT located in a read-only data segment or any code segment when
the L1 is in long mode - BUT that check should only happen when it is in
protected mode.
Shuffling the code a bit to make our emulation follow the specification
allows me to boot a Xen dom0 in a nested KVM and start HVM L2 guests
without problems.

KVM: s390/mm: Fix CMMA reset during reboot
commit 1c343f7b0e177e8ca7f4d4a5dd1fa790f85abbcc upstream.
commit 1e133ab296f ("s390/mm: split arch/s390/mm/pgtable.c") factored
out the page table handling code from \_\_gmap\_zap and \_\_s390\_reset\_cmma
into ptep\_zap\_unused and added a simple flag that tells which one of the
function (reset or not) is to be made. This also changed the behaviour,
as it also zaps unused page table entries on reset.
Turns out that this is wrong as s390\_reset\_cmma uses the page walker,
which DOES NOT take the ptl lock.
The most simple fix is to not do the zapping part on reset (which uses
the walker)

kvm: Fix irq route entries exceeding KVM\_MAX\_IRQ\_ROUTES

These days, we experienced one guest crash with 8 cores and 3 disks,
with qemu error logs as bellow:
qemu-system-x86\_64: /build/qemu-2.0.0/kvm-all.c:984:
kvm\_irqchip\_commit\_routes: Assertion `ret == 0' failed.
And then we found one patch(bdf026317d) in qemu tree, which said
could fix this bug.
Execute the following script will reproduce the BUG quickly:
irq\_affinity.sh
========================================================================

vdb\_irq\_num=27
while [ 1 ]
do
for irq in {1,2,4,8,10,20,40,80}

dd if=/dev/vdb of=/dev/zero bs=4K count=100 iflag=direct
done
done
========================================================================
The following qemu log is added in the qemu code and is displayed when
this bug reproduced:
kvm\_irqchip\_commit\_routes: max gsi: 1008, nr\_allocated\_irq\_routes: 1024,
irq\_routes->nr: 1024, gsi\_count: 1024.
That's to say when irq\_routes->nr == 1024, there are 1024 routing entries,
but in the kernel code when routes->nr >= 1024, will just return -EINVAL;
The nr is the number of the routing entries which is in of
[1 ~ KVM\_MAX\_IRQ\_ROUTES], not the index in [0 ~ KVM\_MAX\_IRQ\_ROUTES - 1].

KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
commit 38327424b40bcebe2de92d07312c89360ac9229a upstream.
If \_\_key\_link\_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized. I've
added a check to fix that.
This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
difficult to achieve. There are three ways it can be done as the user
would have to cause an error to occur in \_\_key\_link():
(1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory. In practice, this is difficult
to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
attempt.
(2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
and it being tested for revocation. In practice, this is difficult to
time correctly because the KEYCTL\_REJECT function can only be used
from the request-key upcall process. Further, users can only make use
of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
(3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
so that it fails with EDQUOT.
The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
following:
echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root\_maxbytes
keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system. Note also that
the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
changing the amount of quota used.
Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:

ipv6: Fix mem leak in rt6i\_pcpu
[ Upstream commit 903ce4abdf374e3365d93bcb3df56c62008835ba ]
It was first reported and reproduced by Petr (thanks!) in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=119581
free\_percpu(rt->rt6i\_pcpu) used to always happen in ip6\_dst\_destroy().
However, after fixing a deadlock bug in
commit 9c7370a166b4 ("ipv6: Fix a potential deadlock when creating pcpu rt"),
free\_percpu() is not called before setting non\_pcpu\_rt->rt6i\_pcpu to NULL.
It is worth to note that rt6i\_pcpu is protected by table->tb6\_lock.
kmemleak somehow did not report it. We nailed it down by
observing the pcpu entries in /proc/vmallocinfo (first suggested
by Hannes, thanks!).

cdc\_ncm: workaround for EM7455 "silent" data interface
[ Upstream commit c086e7096170390594c425114d98172bc9aceb8a ]
Several Lenovo users have reported problems with their Sierra
Wireless EM7455 modem. The driver has loaded successfully and
the MBIM management channel has appeared to work, including
establishing a connection to the mobile network. But no frames
have been received over the data interface.
The problem affects all EM7455 and MC7455, and is assumed to
affect other modems based on the same Qualcomm chipset and
baseband firmware.
Testing narrowed the problem down to what seems to be a
firmware timing bug during initialization. Adding a short sleep
while probing is sufficient to make the problem disappear.
Experiments have shown that 1-2 ms is too little to have any
effect, while 10-20 ms is enough to reliably succeed.

packet: Use symmetric hash for PACKET\_FANOUT\_HASH.
[ Upstream commit eb70db8756717b90c01ccc765fdefc4dd969fc74 ]
People who use PACKET\_FANOUT\_HASH want a symmetric hash, meaning that
they want packets going in both directions on a flow to hash to the
same bucket.
The core kernel SKB hash became non-symmetric when the ipv6 flow label
and other entities were incorporated into the standard flow hash order
to increase entropy.
But there are no users of PACKET\_FANOUT\_HASH who want an assymetric
hash, they all want a symmetric one.
Therefore, use the flow dissector to compute a flat symmetric hash
over only the protocol, addresses and ports. This hash does not get
installed into and override the normal skb hash, so this change has
no effect whatsoever on the rest of the stack.

So I \_should\_ have looked at other unserialized users of ->load\_avg,
but alas. Luckily nikbor reported a similar /0 from task\_h\_load() which
instantly triggered recollection of this here problem.
Aside from the intermediate value hitting memory and causing problems,
there's another problem: the underflow detection relies on the signed
bit. This reduces the effective width of the variables, IOW its
effectively the same as having these variables be of signed type.
This patch changes to a different means of unsigned underflow
detection to not rely on the signed bit. This allows the variables to
use the 'full' unsigned range. And it does so with explicit LOAD -
STORE to ensure any intermediate value will never be visible in
memory, allowing these unserialized loads.
Note: GCC generates crap code for this, might warrant a look later.
Note2: I say 'full' above, if we end up at U\*\_MAX we'll still explode;
maybe we should do clamping on add too.

UBIFS is using PagePrivate() which can have different meanings across
filesystems. Therefore the generic page migration code cannot handle this
case correctly.
We have to implement our own migration function which basically does a
plain copy but also duplicates the page private flag.
UBIFS is not a block device filesystem and cannot use buffer\_migrate\_page().

irqchip/mips-gic: Fix IRQs in gic\_dev\_domain
commit 4b2312bd0592708c85ed94368c874819e7013309 upstream.
When allocating a new device IRQ, gic\_dev\_domain\_alloc() correctly calls
irq\_domain\_set\_hwirq\_and\_chip(), but gic\_irq\_domain\_alloc() does not. This
means that gic\_irq\_domain believes all IRQs from the dev domain have an
hwirq of 0 and creates incorrect mappings in the linear\_revmap. As
gic\_irq\_domain is a parent of the gic\_dev\_domain, this leads to an
inability to boot on devices with a GIC. Excerpt of the error:
[ 2.297649] irq 0: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
...
[ 2.436963] handlers:
[ 2.439492] Disabling IRQ #0
Fix this by calling irq\_domain\_set\_hwirq\_and\_chip() for both the dev and
irq domain.
Now that we are modifying the parent domain, be sure to clear it up in
case of an allocation error.

MIPS: KVM: Fix modular KVM under QEMU
commit 797179bc4fe06c89e47a9f36f886f68640b423f8 upstream.
Copy \_\_kvm\_mips\_vcpu\_run() into unmapped memory, so that we can never
get a TLB refill exception in it when KVM is built as a module.
This was observed to happen with the host MIPS kernel running under
QEMU, due to a not entirely transparent optimisation in the QEMU TLB
handling where TLB entries replaced with TLBWR are copied to a separate
part of the TLB array. Code in those pages continue to be executable,
but those mappings persist only until the next ASID switch, even if they
are marked global.
An ASID switch happens in \_\_kvm\_mips\_vcpu\_run() at exception level after
switching to the guest exception base. Subsequent TLB mapped kernel
instructions just prior to switching to the guest trigger a TLB refill
exception, which enters the guest exception handlers without updating
EPC. This appears as a guest triggered TLB refill on a host kernel
mapped (host KSeg2) address, which is not handled correctly as user
(guest) mode accesses to kernel (host) segments always generate address
error exceptions.

supplies on the first regulator\_get(), which is done after applying
constraints, and applying the constrains will fail because it calls
\_regulator\_get\_voltage() and \_regulator\_do\_set\_voltage() both of which
will fail on a switch regulator when there is no supply (yet).
This causes registering of all axp22x regulators to fail with the

ARM: 8579/1: mm: Fix definition of pmd\_mknotpresent
commit 56530f5d2ddc9b9fade7ef8db9cb886e9dc689b5 upstream.
Currently pmd\_mknotpresent will use a zero entry to respresent an

Unfortunately this definition clashes with pmd\_none, thus it is
possible for a race condition to occur if zap\_pmd\_range sees pmd\_none
whilst \_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked is running too with pmdp\_invalidate

This patch fixes the race condition by modifying pmd\_mknotpresent to

ARM: 8578/1: mm: ensure pmd\_present only checks the valid bit
commit 624531886987f0f1b5d01fb598034d039198e090 upstream.
In a subsequent patch, pmd\_mknotpresent will clear the valid bit of the
pmd entry, resulting in a not-present entry from the hardware's
perspective. Unfortunately, pmd\_present simply checks for a non-zero pmd
value and will therefore continue to return true even after a
pmd\_mknotpresent operation. Since pmd\_mknotpresent is only used for
managing huge entries, this is only an issue for the 3-level case.
This patch fixes the 3-level pmd\_present implementation to take into
account the valid bit. For bisectability, the change is made before the
fix to pmd\_mknotpresent.

commit d20cb71dbf3487f24549ede1a8e2d67579b4632e upstream.
In "NFSv4: Move dentry instantiation into the NFSv4-specific atomic open code"
unconditional d\_drop() after the ->open\_context() had been removed. It had
been correct for success cases (there ->open\_context() itself had been doing
dcache manipulations), but not for error ones. Only one of those (ENOENT)
got a compensatory d\_drop() added in that commit, but in fact it should've
been done for all errors. As it is, the case of O\_CREAT non-exclusive open
on a hashed negative dentry racing with e.g. symlink creation from another
client ended up with ->open\_context() getting an error and proceeding to
call nfs\_lookup(). On a hashed dentry, which would've instantly triggered
BUG\_ON() in d\_materialise\_unique() (or, these days, its equivalent in

nfsd: check permissions when setting ACLs
commit 999653786df6954a31044528ac3f7a5dadca08f4 upstream.
Use set\_posix\_acl, which includes proper permission checks, instead of
calling ->set\_acl directly. Without this anyone may be able to grant
themselves permissions to a file by setting the ACL.
Lock the inode to make the new checks atomic with respect to set\_acl.
(Also, nfsd was the only caller of set\_acl not locking the inode, so I
suspect this may fix other races.)
This also simplifies the code, and ensures our ACLs are checked by
posix\_acl\_valid.
The permission checks and the inode locking were lost with commit
4ac7249e, which changed nfsd to use the set\_acl inode operation directly
instead of going through xattr handlers.

It used to be the case that state had an rwlock that was locked for write

if there are two competing opens for the same state, they step on

from the state structure, since access mode is a bitmap only set once.

writeback: use higher precision calculation in domain\_dirty\_limits()
commit 62a584fe05eef1f80ed49a286a29328f1a224fb9 upstream.
As vm.dirty\_[background\_]bytes can't be applied verbatim to multiple
cgroup writeback domains, they get converted to percentages in
domain\_dirty\_limits() and applied the same way as
vm.dirty\_[background]ratio. However, if the specified bytes is lower
than 1% of available memory, the calculated ratios become zero and the
writeback domain gets throttled constantly.
Fix it by using per-PAGE\_SIZE instead of percentage for ratio
calculations. Also, the updated DIV\_ROUND\_UP() usages now should
yield 1/4096 (0.0244%) as the minimum ratio as long as the specified
bytes are above zero.

autofs braino fix for do\_last()
commit e6ec03a25f12b312b7e0c037fe4a6471c4ee5665 upstream.
It's an analogue of commit 7500c38a (fix the braino in "namei:
massage lookup\_slow() to be usable by lookup\_one\_len\_unlocked()").
The same problem (->lookup()-returned unhashed negative dentry
just might be an autofs one with ->d\_manage() that would wait
until the daemon makes it positive) applies in do\_last() - we
need to do follow\_managed() first.
Fortunately, remaining callers of follow\_managed() are OK - only
autofs has that weirdness (negative dentry that does not mean
an instant -ENOENT)) and autofs never has its negative dentries
hashed, so we can't pick one from a dcache lookup.
->d\_manage() is a bloody mess ;-/

Revert "gpiolib: Split GPIO flags parsing and GPIO configuration"
commit 85b03b3033fd4eba82665b3b9902c095a08cc52f upstream.
This reverts commit 923b93e451db876d1479d3e4458fce14fec31d1c.
Make sure consumers do not overwrite gpio flags for pins that have
already been claimed.
While adding support for gpio drivers to refuse a request using
unsupported flags, the order of when the requested flag was checked and
the new flags were applied was reversed to that consumers could
overwrite flags for already requested gpios.
This not only affects device-tree setups where two drivers could request
the same gpio using conflicting configurations, but also allowed user
space to clear gpio flags for already claimed pins simply by attempting
to export them through the sysfs interface. By for example clearing the
FLAG\_ACTIVE\_LOW flag this way, user space could effectively change the
polarity of a signal.
Reverting this change obviously prevents gpio drivers from doing sanity
checks on the flags in their request callbacks. Fortunately only one
recently added driver (gpio-tps65218 in v4.6) appears to do this, and a
follow up patch could restore this functionality through a different
interface.

gpio: sch: Fix Oops on module load on Asus Eee PC 1201
commit 87041a58d3b19455d39baed2a5e5bb43b58fb915 upstream.
This fixes the issue descirbe in bug 117531
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=117531).
It's a regression introduced in linux 4.5 that causes a Oops at load of
gpio\_sch and prevents powering off the computer.
The issue is that sch\_gpio\_reg\_set is called in sch\_gpio\_probe before
gpio\_chip data is initialized with the pointer to the sch\_gpio struct. As
sch\_gpio\_reg\_set calls gpiochip\_get\_data, it returns NULL which causes
the Oops.
The patch follows Mika's advice (https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/9/61) and
consists in modifying sch\_gpio\_reg\_get and sch\_gpio\_reg\_set to take a
sch\_gpio struct directly instead of a gpio\_chip, which avoids the call to
gpiochip\_get\_data.
Thanks Mika for your patience with me :-)

x86/amd\_nb: Fix boot crash on non-AMD systems
commit 1ead852dd88779eda12cb09cc894a03d9abfe1ec upstream.
Fix boot crash that triggers if this driver is built into a kernel and
run on non-AMD systems.
AMD northbridges users call amd\_cache\_northbridges() and it returns
a negative value to signal that we weren't able to cache/detect any
northbridges on the system.
At least, it should do so as all its callers expect it to do so. But it
does return a negative value only when kmalloc() fails.
Fix it to return -ENODEV if there are no NBs cached as otherwise, amd\_nb
users like amd64\_edac, for example, which relies on it to know whether
it should load or not, gets loaded on systems like Intel Xeons where it
shouldn't.

kprobes/x86: Clear TF bit in fault on single-stepping
commit dcfc47248d3f7d28df6f531e6426b933de94370d upstream.
Fix kprobe\_fault\_handler() to clear the TF (trap flag) bit of
the flags register in the case of a fault fixup on single-stepping.
If we put a kprobe on the instruction which caused a
page fault (e.g. actual mov instructions in copy\_user\_\*),
that fault happens on the single-stepping buffer. In this
case, kprobes resets running instance so that the CPU can
retry execution on the original ip address.
However, current code forgets to reset the TF bit. Since this
fault happens with TF bit set for enabling single-stepping,
when it retries, it causes a debug exception and kprobes
can not handle it because it already reset itself.
On the most of x86-64 platform, it can be easily reproduced
by using kprobe tracer. E.g.
# cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
# echo p copy\_user\_enhanced\_fast\_string+5 > kprobe\_events
# echo 1 > events/kprobes/enable
And you'll see a kernel panic on do\_debug(), since the debug
trap is not handled by kprobes.
To fix this problem, we just need to clear the TF bit when
resetting running kprobe.

cpuidle: Do not access cpuidle\_devices when !CONFIG\_CPU\_IDLE
commit 9bd616e3dbedfc103f158197c8ad93678849b1ed upstream.
The cpuidle\_devices per-CPU variable is only defined when CPU\_IDLE is
enabled. Commit c8cc7d4de7a4 ("sched/idle: Reorganize the idle loop")
removed the #ifdef CONFIG\_CPU\_IDLE around cpuidle\_idle\_call() with the
compiler optimising away \_\_this\_cpu\_read(cpuidle\_devices). However, with
CONFIG\_UBSAN && !CONFIG\_CPU\_IDLE, this optimisation no longer happens
and the kernel fails to link since cpuidle\_devices is not defined.
This patch introduces an accessor function for the current CPU cpuidle
device (returning NULL when !CONFIG\_CPU\_IDLE) and uses it in
cpuidle\_idle\_call().

locking/static\_key: Fix concurrent static\_key\_slow\_inc()
commit 4c5ea0a9cd02d6aa8adc86e100b2a4cff8d614ff upstream.
The following scenario is possible:
CPU 1 CPU 2
static\_key\_slow\_inc()
atomic\_inc\_not\_zero()
-> key.enabled == 0, no increment
jump\_label\_lock()
atomic\_inc\_return()
-> key.enabled == 1 now
static\_key\_slow\_inc()
atomic\_inc\_not\_zero()
-> key.enabled == 1, inc to 2
return
\*\* static key is wrong!
jump\_label\_update()
jump\_label\_unlock()
Testing the static key at the point marked by (\*\*) will follow the
wrong path for jumps that have not been patched yet. This can
actually happen when creating many KVM virtual machines with userspace
LAPIC emulation; just run several copies of the following program:
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main(void)
{
for (;;) {
int kvmfd = open("/dev/kvm", O\_RDONLY);
int vmfd = ioctl(kvmfd, KVM\_CREATE\_VM, 0);
close(ioctl(vmfd, KVM\_CREATE\_VCPU, 1));
close(vmfd);
close(kvmfd);
}
return 0;
}
Every KVM\_CREATE\_VCPU ioctl will attempt a static\_key\_slow\_inc() call.
The static key's purpose is to skip NULL pointer checks and indeed one
of the processes eventually dereferences NULL.
As explained in the commit that introduced the bug:
706249c222f6 ("locking/static\_keys: Rework update logic")
jump\_label\_update() needs key.enabled to be true. The solution adopted
here is to temporarily make key.enabled == -1, and use go down the
slow path when key.enabled <= 0.

locking/qspinlock: Fix spin\_unlock\_wait() some more
commit 2c610022711675ee908b903d242f0b90e1db661f upstream.
While this prior commit:
54cf809b9512 ("locking,qspinlock: Fix spin\_is\_locked() and spin\_unlock\_wait()")
... fixes spin\_is\_locked() and spin\_unlock\_wait() for the usage
in ipc/sem and netfilter, it does not in fact work right for the
usage in task\_work and futex.
So while the 2 locks crossed problem:
spin\_lock(A) spin\_lock(B)
if (!spin\_is\_locked(B)) spin\_unlock\_wait(A)
foo() foo();
... works with the smp\_mb() injected by both spin\_is\_locked() and
spin\_unlock\_wait(), this is not sufficient for:
flag = 1;
smp\_mb(); spin\_lock()
spin\_unlock\_wait() if (!flag)
// add to lockless list
// iterate lockless list
... because in this scenario, the store from spin\_lock() can be delayed
past the load of flag, uncrossing the variables and loosing the
guarantee.
This patch reworks spin\_is\_locked() and spin\_unlock\_wait() to work in
both cases by exploiting the observation that while the lock byte
store can be delayed, the contender must have registered itself
visibly in other state contained in the word.
It also allows for architectures to override both functions, as PPC
and ARM64 have an additional issue for which we currently have no
generic solution.

locking/ww\_mutex: Report recursive ww\_mutex locking early
commit 0422e83d84ae24b933e4b0d4c1e0f0b4ae8a0a3b upstream.
Recursive locking for ww\_mutexes was originally conceived as an
exception. However, it is heavily used by the DRM atomic modesetting
code. Currently, the recursive deadlock is checked after we have queued
up for a busy-spin and as we never release the lock, we spin until
kicked, whereupon the deadlock is discovered and reported.
A simple solution for the now common problem is to move the recursive
deadlock discovery to the first action when taking the ww\_mutex.

mnt: Account for MS\_RDONLY in fs\_fully\_visible
commit 695e9df010e40f407f4830dc11d53dce957710ba upstream.
In rare cases it is possible for s\_flags & MS\_RDONLY to be set but
MNT\_READONLY to be clear. This starting combination can cause
fs\_fully\_visible to fail to ensure that the new mount is readonly.
Therefore force MNT\_LOCK\_READONLY in the new mount if MS\_RDONLY
is set on the source filesystem of the mount.
In general both MS\_RDONLY and MNT\_READONLY are set at the same for
mounts so I don't expect any programs to care. Nor do I expect
MS\_RDONLY to be set on proc or sysfs in the initial user namespace,
which further decreases the likelyhood of problems.
Which means this change should only affect system configurations by
paranoid sysadmins who should welcome the additional protection
as it keeps people from wriggling out of their policies.

USB: don't free bandwidth\_mutex too early
commit ab2a4bf83902c170d29ba130a8abb5f9d90559e1 upstream.
The USB core contains a bug that can show up when a USB-3 host
controller is removed. If the primary (USB-2) hcd structure is
released before the shared (USB-3) hcd, the core will try to do a
double-free of the common bandwidth\_mutex.
The problem was described in graphical form by Chung-Geol Kim, who
first reported it:

|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|
=================================================
This happens because hcd\_release() frees the bandwidth\_mutex whenever
it sees a primary hcd being released (which is not a very good idea
in any case), but in the course of releasing the primary hcd, it
changes the pointers in the shared hcd in such a way that the shared
hcd will appear to be primary when it gets released.
This patch fixes the problem by changing hcd\_release() so that it
deallocates the bandwidth\_mutex only when the \_last\_ hcd structure
referencing it is released. The patch also removes an unnecessary
test, so that when an hcd is released, both the shared\_hcd and
primary\_hcd pointers in the hcd's peer will be cleared.

A patch that went into Linux-4.4 to fix big-endian mode on a Lantiq
MIPS system unfortunately broke big-endian operation on PowerPC
APM82181 as reported by Christian Lamparter, and likely other
systems.
It actually introduced multiple issues:
- it broke big-endian ARM kernels: any machine that was working
correctly with a little-endian kernel is no longer using byteswaps
on big-endian kernels, which clearly breaks them.
- On PowerPC the same thing must be true: if it was working before,
using big-endian kernels is now broken. Unlike ARM, 32-bit PowerPC
usually uses big-endian kernels, so they are likely all broken.
- The barrier for dwc2\_writel is on the wrong side of the \_\_raw\_writel(),
so the MMIO no longer synchronizes with DMA operations.
- On architectures that require specific CPU instructions for MMIO
access, using the \_\_raw\_ variant may turn this into a pointer
dereference that does not have the same effect as the readl/writel.
This patch is a simple revert for all architectures other than MIPS,
in the hope that we can more easily backport it to fix the regression
on PowerPC and ARM systems without breaking the Lantiq system again.
We should follow this up with a more elaborate change to add runtime
detection of endianness, to make sure it also works on all other
combinations of architectures and implementations of the usb-dwc2
device. That patch however will be fairly large and not appropriate
for backports to stable kernels.
Felipe suggested a different approach, using an endianness switching
register to always put the device into LE mode, but unfortunately
the dwc2 hardware does not provide a generic way to do that. Also,
I see no practical way of addressing the problem more generally by
patching architecture specific code on MIPS.

powerpc/tm: Always reclaim in start\_thread() for exec() class syscalls
commit 8e96a87c5431c256feb65bcfc5aec92d9f7839b6 upstream.
Userspace can quite legitimately perform an exec() syscall with a
suspended transaction. exec() does not return to the old process, rather
it load a new one and starts that, the expectation therefore is that the
new process starts not in a transaction. Currently exec() is not treated
any differently to any other syscall which creates problems.
Firstly it could allow a new process to start with a suspended
transaction for a binary that no longer exists. This means that the
checkpointed state won't be valid and if the suspended transaction were
ever to be resumed and subsequently aborted (a possibility which is
exceedingly likely as exec()ing will likely doom the transaction) the
new process will jump to invalid state.
Secondly the incorrect attempt to keep the transactional state while
still zeroing state for the new process creates at least two TM Bad
Things. The first triggers on the rfid to return to userspace as
start\_thread() has given the new process a 'clean' MSR but the suspend
will still be set in the hardware MSR. The second TM Bad Thing triggers
in \_\_switch\_to() as the processor is still transactionally suspended but
\_\_switch\_to() wants to zero the TM sprs for the new process.
This is an example of the outcome of calling exec() with a suspended
transaction. Note the first 700 is likely the first TM bad thing
decsribed earlier only the kernel can't report it as we've loaded
userspace registers. c000000000009980 is the rfid in
fast\_exception\_return()

powerpc/pseries: Fix IBM\_ARCH\_VEC\_NRCORES\_OFFSET since POWER8NVL was added
commit 2c2a63e301fd19ccae673e79de59b30a232ff7f9 upstream.
The recent commit 7cc851039d64 ("powerpc/pseries: Add POWER8NVL support
to ibm,client-architecture-support call") added a new PVR mask & value
to the start of the ibm\_architecture\_vec[] array.
However it missed the fact that further down in the array, we hard code
the offset of one of the fields, and then at boot use that value to
patch the value in the array. This means every update to the array must
also update the #define, ugh.
This means that on pseries machines we will misreport to firmware the
number of cores we support, by a factor of threads\_per\_core.
Fix it for now by updating the #define.

powerpc/pseries: Fix PCI config address for DDW
commit 8a934efe94347eee843aeea65bdec8077a79e259 upstream.
In commit 8445a87f7092 "powerpc/iommu: Remove the dependency on EEH
struct in DDW mechanism", the PE address was replaced with the PCI
config address in order to remove dependency on EEH. According to PAPR
spec, firmware (pHyp or QEMU) should accept "xxBBSSxx" format PCI config
address, not "xxxxBBSS" provided by the patch. Note that "BB" is PCI bus
number and "SS" is the combination of slot and function number.
This fixes the PCI address passed to DDW RTAS calls.

powerpc/iommu: Remove the dependency on EEH struct in DDW mechanism
commit 8445a87f7092bc8336ea1305be9306f26b846d93 upstream.
Commit 39baadbf36ce ("powerpc/eeh: Remove eeh information from pci\_dn")
changed the pci\_dn struct by removing its EEH-related members.
As part of this clean-up, DDW mechanism was modified to read the device
configuration address from eeh\_dev struct.
As a consequence, now if we disable EEH mechanism on kernel command-line
for example, the DDW mechanism will fail, generating a kernel oops by
dereferencing a NULL pointer (which turns to be the eeh\_dev pointer).
This patch just changes the configuration address calculation on DDW
functions to a manual calculation based on pci\_dn members instead of
using eeh\_dev-based address.
No functional changes were made. This was tested on pSeries, both
in PHyp and qemu guest.

futex: Calculate the futex key based on a tail page for file-based futexes
commit 077fa7aed17de5022e44bf07dbaf732078b7b5b2 upstream.
Mike Galbraith reported that the LTP test case futex\_wake04 was broken
by commit 65d8fc777f6d ("futex: Remove requirement for lock\_page()
in get\_futex\_key()").
This test case uses futexes backed by hugetlbfs pages and so there is an
associated inode with a futex stored on such pages. The problem is that
the key is being calculated based on the head page index of the hugetlbfs
page and not the tail page.
Prior to the optimisation, the page lock was used to stabilise mappings and
pin the inode is file-backed which is overkill. If the page was a compound
page, the head page was automatically looked up as part of the page lock
operation but the tail page index was used to calculate the futex key.
After the optimisation, the compound head is looked up early and the page
lock is only relied upon to identify truncated pages, special pages or a
shmem page moving to swapcache. The head page is looked up because without
the page lock, special care has to be taken to pin the inode correctly.
However, the tail page is still required to calculate the futex key so
this patch records the tail page.
On vanilla 4.6, the output of the test case is;
futex\_wake04 0 TINFO : Hugepagesize 2097152

cfg80211: fix proto in ieee80211\_data\_to\_8023 for frames without LLC header
commit c041778c966c92c964033f1cdfee60a9f2b5e465 upstream.
The PDU length of incoming LLC frames is set to the total skb payload size
in \_\_ieee80211\_data\_to\_8023() of net/wireless/util.c which incorrectly
includes the length of the IEEE 802.11 header.
The resulting LLC frame header has a too large PDU length, causing the
llc\_fixup\_skb() function of net/llc/llc\_input.c to reject the incoming
skb, effectively breaking STP.
Solve the problem by properly substracting the IEEE 802.11 frame header size
from the PDU length, allowing the LLC processor to pick up the incoming
control messages.
Special thanks to Gerry Rozema for tracking down the regression and proposing
a suitable patch.

commit 126e7557328a1cd576be4fca95b133a2695283ff upstream.
If a user space program (e.g., wpa\_supplicant) deletes a STA entry that
is currently in NL80211\_PLINK\_ESTAB state, the number of established
plinks counter was not decremented and this could result in rejecting
new plink establishment before really hitting the real maximum plink
limit. For !user\_mpm case, this decrementation is handled by
mesh\_plink\_deactive().
Fix this by decrementing estab\_plinks on STA deletion
(mesh\_sta\_cleanup() gets called from there) so that the counter has a
correct value and the Beacon frame advertisement in Mesh Configuration
element shows the proper value for capability to accept additional
peers.

mac80211\_hwsim: Add missing check for HWSIM\_ATTR\_SIGNAL
commit 62397da50bb20a6b812c949ef465d7e69fe54bb6 upstream.
A wmediumd that does not send this attribute causes a NULL pointer
dereference, as the attribute is accessed even if it does not exist.
The attribute was required but never checked ever since userspace frame
forwarding has been introduced. The issue gets more problematic once we
allow wmediumd registration from user namespaces.

mac80211: mesh: flush mesh paths unconditionally
commit fe7a7c57629e8dcbc0e297363a9b2366d67a6dc5 upstream.
Currently, the mesh paths associated with a nexthop station are cleaned
up in the following code path:
\_\_sta\_info\_destroy\_part1
synchronize\_net()
\_\_sta\_info\_destroy\_part2
-> cleanup\_single\_sta
-> mesh\_sta\_cleanup
-> mesh\_plink\_deactivate
-> mesh\_path\_flush\_by\_nexthop
However, there are a couple of problems here:
1) the paths aren't flushed at all if the MPM is running in userspace
(e.g. when using wpa\_supplicant or authsae)
2) there is no synchronize\_rcu between removing the path and readers
accessing the nexthop, which means the following race is possible:
CPU0 CPU1
~~~~ ~~~~
sta\_info\_destroy\_part1()
synchronize\_net()
rcu\_read\_lock()
mesh\_nexthop\_resolve()
mpath = mesh\_path\_lookup()
[...] -> mesh\_path\_flush\_by\_nexthop()
sta = rcu\_dereference(
mpath->next\_hop)
kfree(sta)
access sta <-- CRASH
Fix both of these by unconditionally flushing paths before destroying
the sta, and by adding a synchronize\_net() after path flush to ensure
no active readers can still dereference the sta.
Fixes this crash:

mac80211: fix fast\_tx header alignment
commit 6fe04128f158c5ad27e7504bfdf1b12e63331bc9 upstream.
The header field is defined as u8[] but also accessed as struct
ieee80211\_hdr. Enforce an alignment of 2 to prevent unnecessary
unaligned accesses, which can be very harmful for performance on many
platforms.

cfg80211: remove get/set antenna and tx power warnings
commit 6cbf6236d54c24b9a29e6892549c25b6902b44ce upstream.
Since set\_tx\_power and set\_antenna are frequently implemented
without the matching get\_tx\_power/get\_antenna, we shouldn't
have added warnings for those. Remove them.
The remaining ones are correct and need to be implemented
symmetrically for correct operation.
