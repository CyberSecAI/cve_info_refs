Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a change in the `proc_pid_attr_write()` function, which started using `memdup_user`. This change violated AppArmor's assumption that the `setprocattr` buffer would always be a single page. The AppArmor code incorrectly assumed it had a PAGE_SIZE buffer and attempted null termination, leading to an out-of-bounds write if the size was exactly PAGE_SIZE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect assumption about buffer size:** AppArmor assumed a fixed size (single page) for the setprocattr buffer and didn't properly validate the size when `memdup_user` was introduced.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The attempt to null-terminate the buffer could lead to a write beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries, especially if it was PAGE_SIZE in size. This can lead to a kernel oops.
- **Lack of Robustness:** The code lacked a size check, relying on `proc_pid_attr_write()` to handle larger buffers. However, this reliance did not cover the case where a buffer equal to page size was passed.
- **Interface violation:** Apparmor violated the interface by not handling all possible cases when `proc_pid_attr_write()` started using `memdup_user`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While the primary impact described is a kernel oops, the possibility of local privilege escalation was noted. An attacker might be able to leverage this out-of-bounds write to gain elevated privileges, although the specifics were not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A local user could trigger this vulnerability by writing to a process attribute using `setprocattr` with a crafted buffer of a specific size, violating AppArmor's assumption about a single-page buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have local access to the system to interact with the `/proc` filesystem and call the `setprocattr` interface. 
- The attacker must be able to control the size and content of the data written through setprocattr

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding a buffer size validation and handling the case where AppArmor needs to null-terminate the buffer by allocating a slightly larger buffer.
- The vulnerability was initially reported by Vegard Nossum.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected because AppArmor is not enabled in any current shipping kernels.
- Patches were also reviewed by Tyler Hicks.

In summary, this vulnerability stemmed from an interface violation in AppArmor code due to a change in a related kernel function. This resulted in a potential out-of-bounds write due to incorrect buffer size assumptions.
