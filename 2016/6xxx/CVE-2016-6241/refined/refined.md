Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6241:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in amap allocation routines. Specifically, in `amap_alloc1()`, the calculation of `totalslots` (used to determine memory allocation size) can overflow the original `slots` value due to an integer rounding up operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Integer overflow when calculating memory allocation size
*   Potential for out-of-bounds read/write on the kernel allocation heap if the amap structure is accessed after the overflow and undersized allocation occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Kernel memory corruption when accessing the amap structure's members such as `am_slots`, `am_bckptr` or `am_anon`, leading to possible crashes or unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Local user can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specific size value when calling the `mmap()` system call with the `__MAP_NOFAULT` flag. This leads to the vulnerable code being called within the kernel during amap allocation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a local user capable of making system calls.

**Details:**

The vulnerability stems from how the amap structure is allocated in the kernel when the `__MAP_NOFAULT` flag is provided to `mmap()`. Specifically:

1.  `amap_alloc()` calculates the number of slots required based on user-provided size (`size_t size`).
2.  `amap_alloc1()` then rounds this number of slots up to the nearest full page. This rounding operation can cause `totalslots` to overflow, leading to a smaller than required amap allocation.
3. The undersized allocation will result in an out-of-bounds read or write if members of the `amap` structure are accessed.

The following is the relevant part of the description provided by the CVE assignment team:
> The second problem arises in amap_alloc1():
>> The number of slots is rounded up so that the slot entries fill
>> full pages. This rounding up happens in the integer "totalslots"
>> variable, and can overflow the original "slots" value. This
>> can happen when requesting an allocation of size 0xfff.ffff.0000,
>> for example. In this case amap_alloc() computes that
>> 0xffff.fff0 slots are needed and amap_alloc1() computes
>> that zero totalslots are needed, and allocates an amap of zero
>> bytes. If the amap->am_slots, amap->am_bckptr or amap->am_anon
>> fields are later accessed, it can lead to out-of-memory
>> reads and writes on the kernel allocation heap.

The information provided on the openbsd errata page for patch 023 provides additional confirmation:
>Unchecked parameters and integer overflows in the amap allocation routines
> could cause malloc(9) to either not allocate enough memory, leading to memory
> corruption, or to trigger a "malloc: allocation too large" panic.
