Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-6296:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from an integer signedness error within the `simplestring_addn` function in the `simplestring.c` file of the `xmlrpc-epi` library. This function is used for adding data to a string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Integer Signedness Error:** The `simplestring_addn` function uses a length parameter as a signed integer. This allows an attacker to manipulate the length parameter to a negative value, bypassing bounds checks.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** When a large or negative length value is used, the subsequent memory copy operation within the function can result in a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most likely outcome of exploiting this vulnerability is a DoS caused by a crash of the application due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, the buffer overflow could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious PHP Script:** A specially crafted PHP script can exploit this vulnerability when using the `xmlrpc_encode_request()` function, which relies on the vulnerable `xmlrpc-epi` library to serialize data.
*   **Remote Attack:**  The advisory from ubuntu.com suggests a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Execute PHP Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code that utilizes the vulnerable `xmlrpc-epi` library.
*   **Network access:** As per the Ubuntu advisory a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in PHP versions before 5.6.24, 7.0.9.
*   The fix involved checking the length as an unsigned integer.
*   The vulnerability was present in the `xmlrpc-epi` library, but Debian's DLA mentions it exists in the version bundled with php.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when serializing long strings with `xmlrpc_encode_request`.

The analyzed content provides significantly more detail about the root cause and exploitation of the vulnerability than the placeholder CVE description. Specifically, the bugs.php.net entry provides source code level details and an example of a triggering php script. The openwall.com entry shows the CVE assignment details and describes the vulnerable code in `xmlrpc-epi` and how it is included in the php distribution. The ubuntu advisory describes how this vulnerability can lead to a DoS or arbitrary code execution.  The apple document confirms that their systems were also vulnerable to this CVE and also references the fix for this vulnerability which was to upgrade to PHP 5.6.24.
