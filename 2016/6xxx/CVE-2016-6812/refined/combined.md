Hash: SHA1
CVE-2016-6812: XSS risk in Apache CXF FormattedServiceListWriter when a request URL
contains matrix parameters
Severity: Major
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected:
This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.0.12, 3.1.9.
Description:
Apache CXF HTTP transport module uses FormattedServiceListWriter to provide an HTML page which lists the names
and absolute URL addresses of the available service endpoints. The module calculates the base URL using the current
HttpServletRequest. The calculated base URL is used by FormattedServiceListWriter to build the service endpoint
absolute URLs. If the unexpected matrix parameters have been injected into the request URL then these matrix parameters
will find their way back to the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client.
This has been fixed in revisions:
CXF 3.1.x:
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/32e89366
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/1f824d80
CXF 3.0.x
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/1be97cb1
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/a30397b0
CXF 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT (master):
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/45b1b5b9
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/a23c615b
Credit:
The concern was originally raised by Donald Kwakkel.
Mike Noordermeer demonstrated how a concrete XSS attack could be executed against Apache CXF FormattedServiceListWriter.
Migration:
CXF 3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.12 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 3.1.x users should upgrade to 3.1.9 or later as soon as possible.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1406810#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-21 14:32:08 UTC  ```  Apache CXF HTTP transport module uses FormattedServiceListWriter to provide an HTML page which lists the names and absolute URL addresses of the available service endpoints. The module calculates the base URL using the current HttpServletRequest. The calculated base URL is used by FormattedServiceListWriter to build the service endpoint absolute URLs. If the unexpected matrix parameters have been injected into the request URL then these matrix parameters will find their way back to the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client.

#### Description

No output sanitizing is done, which makes the code vulnerable for injection. I do not have a specific use case, but it is good habit to do. Maybe you can use the OWASP Sanitizer: <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_HTML_Sanitizer_Project>

One example from the file:

writer.write("<span class=\"field\">Endpoint address:</span> " + "<span class=\"value\">"

+ absoluteURL + "</span>");

# RHSA-2017:0868 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R2 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was reported that Elasticsearch had vulnerabilities in the Groovy scripting engine, which allow an attacker to construct scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM. (CVE-2015-1427)
* It was found that a flaw in Apache groovy library allows remote code execution wherever deserialization occurs in the application. It is possible for an attacker to craft a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability. (CVE-2016-6814)
* It was found that Apache Commons HttpClient does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. (CVE-2012-5783)
* It was found that swagger-ui contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the key names in the JSON document. An attacker could use this flaw to supply a key name with script tags which could cause arbitrary code execution. Additionally it is possible to load the arbitrary JSON files remotely via the URL query-string parameter. (CVE-2016-1000229)
* A vulnerability was found in FormattedServiceListWriter in Apache CXF HTTP transport module that could allow an attacker to inject unexpected matrix parameters into the request URL. On a successful injection these matrix parameters will find their way back to the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client. (CVE-2016-6812)
* Apache CXF JAX-RS implementation provides a number of Atom MessageBodyReaders. These readers use Apache Abdera Parser to parse Atom feeds or Entries, with this Parser expanding XML entities by default. It was found that this represents a major XXE risk. (CVE-2016-8739)
* A path traversal issue was found in Spark version 2.5 and potentially earlier versions. The vulnerability resides in the functionality to serve static files where there's no protection against directory traversal attacks. This could allow attackers access to private files including sensitive data. (CVE-2016-9177)
* It was found that the camel-snakeyaml component is exploitable for code execution. An attacker could use this vulnerability to send specially crafted payload to a camel-snakeyaml endpoint and causing a remote code execution attack. (CVE-2017-3159)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).
