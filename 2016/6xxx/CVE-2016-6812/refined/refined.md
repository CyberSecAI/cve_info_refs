{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Apache CXF HTTP transport module's FormattedServiceListWriter uses the HttpServletRequest to calculate the base URL for service endpoint URLs. If matrix parameters are injected into the request URL, they are included in the generated service list page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious script into the service list page by including matrix parameters in the request URL. When a client views the service list page, the injected script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to data theft or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker injects malicious matrix parameters into the URL when requesting the service list.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL that will be used by the FormattedServiceListWriter to build the service list page."
