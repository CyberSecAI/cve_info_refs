- **Root cause of vulnerability:** User credentials are stored and transmitted insecurely.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Passwords stored in base64-encoded strings in the web interface configuration page.
    - Credentials transmitted in plain text in the cookie header during client requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain user credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can intercept network traffic or access the web interface configuration page to retrieve user credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic or have access to the DVR web interface to obtain the credentials.
