{
  "CVE-2016-6323": {
    "Description": "The makecontext function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.25 creates execution contexts incompatible with the unwinder on ARM EABI (32-bit) platforms, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (hang), as demonstrated by applications compiled using gccgo, related to backtrace generation.",
    "Root cause": "The `makecontext` function creates execution contexts that are incompatible with the unwinder, specifically on ARM EABI (32-bit) platforms. This happens because `__startcontext` was not marked with `.cantunwind`",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing unwind information"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to hangs in backtrace generation, particularly affecting applications compiled with gccgo.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker by exploiting a function like `makecontext` and then attempting to generate a backtrace.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access or control of the application that can trigger the vulnerable code path.",
    "Additional Information": "The issue is specific to ARM EABI (32-bit) platforms. The fix involves marking `__startcontext` as `.cantunwind`, so that the EABI unwinder does not attempt to unwind past it, which prevents infinite loops."
