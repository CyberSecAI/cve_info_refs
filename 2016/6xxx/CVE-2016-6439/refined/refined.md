Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the detection engine's reassembly of HTTP packets within Cisco Firepower System Software. An error in this process causes the Snort process to unexpectedly restart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of HTTP packet reassembly leading to a denial of service.
- The vulnerability is within the Snort process, causing it to restart unexpectedly

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the Snort process to restart.
- **Traffic Inspection Bypass:** During the restart, Snort detection could be bypassed, or all network traffic inspection could fail.
- **Traffic Disruption:**
    - FirePOWER Platforms: Passive and bypass interfaces will bypass Snort inspection, while routed, switched, and non-bypass interfaces will drop traffic.
    - FirePOWER Threat Defense (FTD) will drop traffic.
    - Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series: If the `sfr fail-open` command is configured, traffic will bypass Snort instead of being dropped.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attackers:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and the attacker does not require prior authentication.
- **Network-based attack:** The attacker sends malicious HTTP packets that exploit the vulnerability in the reassembly process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the device other than the ability to send network traffic.

**Additional Details**
- Affected Products: Multiple Cisco products using specific versions of Firepower System Software are affected. This includes ASA 5500-X series, AMP for Networks appliances, Firepower appliances, and FirePOWER Threat Defense for ISRs, Industrial Security Appliance 3000, Sourcefire 3D System Appliances and Virtual Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPSv) for VMware
- The vulnerability also impacts the open source Snort project
- Fixed versions of software are available.
- A Snort rule (40504) has been released to detect exploitation of this vulnerability
