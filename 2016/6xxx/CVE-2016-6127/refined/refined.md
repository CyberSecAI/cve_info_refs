Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Request Tracker (RT) handles file uploads, specifically when an attacker uploads a malicious file with a certain content type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the potential for XSS. By uploading a file with a crafted content type, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute when a user accesses the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
    *   Access to sensitive data

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector involves uploading a malicious file.
*   **Content Type:** The attacker manipulates the content type of the uploaded file to inject malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the Request Tracker instance. This implies they would need some level of access or the ability to submit a ticket with an attachment.
*  The attacker needs to craft a malicious file with a specific content type

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated by the "AlwaysDownloadAttachments" configuration option. If enabled, files are always downloaded rather than displayed directly in the browser, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.
*   The fix addresses all existing and future uploaded attachments.
*   The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Scott Russo and the GE Application Security Assessment Team.
