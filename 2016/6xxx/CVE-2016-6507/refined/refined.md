Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the MMSE dissector in Wireshark. Specifically, the dissector could enter an infinite loop when processing malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Loop:** The primary weakness is the possibility of the MMSE dissector entering an infinite loop, which can lead to excessive CPU consumption. This is due to an improper handling of certain packet structures or values that cause the dissector to repeatedly perform the same operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By triggering the infinite loop, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially rendering it unresponsive or causing it to crash.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The infinite loop leads to the consumption of CPU resources, affecting the system performance and availability of Wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed Packets:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a specially crafted malformed packet onto the network that Wireshark is monitoring.
- **Malformed Trace Files:** An attacker can convince a user to open a malformed packet trace file, which also triggers the infinite loop vulnerability when the file is processed by Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Packet Injection:** The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malformed network packets if exploiting via a live capture.
- **Social Engineering/File Delivery:** If exploiting via trace file, they need the ability to convince a user to open a malformed capture file using Wireshark.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker requires knowledge of the specific conditions that trigger the infinite loop in the MMSE dissector.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.12, and it was fixed in version 1.12.13.
- This is one of several vulnerabilities fixed in Wireshark, as indicated by the Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3648-1) which addresses multiple CVEs.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Chris Benedict, Aurelien Delaitre, and the NIST SAMATE Project.
