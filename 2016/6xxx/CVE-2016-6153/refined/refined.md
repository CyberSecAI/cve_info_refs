Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `os_unix.c` file within SQLite, specifically in the `unixTempFileDir` function. This function implements the algorithm for selecting a temporary directory on Unix-like systems.
*   The function iterates through a list of potential temporary directory locations (environment variables, /var/tmp, /usr/tmp, /tmp, and current working directory "."), checking if they are readable, writable, and executable.
*   The flaw is that the check for permissions incorrectly excludes directories that have only write and execute permissions but not read (e.g. mode 1733). As a fallback, if all other checks fail, the current working directory "." is used even if it also fails to pass the -wx permission check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Check:** The logic in `unixTempFileDir` incorrectly checks for all three (read, write, execute) permissions instead of just checking for write and execute permission as required by sqlite.
*   **Unsafe Fallback:** Even if the permissions of the current working directory "." do not have -wx it will still return current working directory as the tempdir, if all other tempdirs fail the check, which might be unsafe.
*   **Ignored Check Results:**  When checking the permissions of ".", the check is performed but results are ignored.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** If the current working directory is an unsafe location (e.g. network share), sensitive data written to temporary files might be exposed.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the current working directory is not writable, the application or the SQLite library might crash or behave in unexpected ways due to the inability to create temporary files.
*  **Unspecified Other Impact:** The usage of unsafe working directory may result in other potential unspecified consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to influence the execution environment, such as by setting the current working directory, TMPDIR, or SQLITE_TMPDIR to an unsafe location with specific permissions.
*  An attacker would need to cause sqlite to trigger the use of temporary files (e.g. using VACUUM, creating TEMP tables etc.)

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves modifying the temporary directory search algorithm to correctly consider directories that have write and execute permissions but lack read permissions. The fix also ensures that "." is not returned if it lacks the -wx permission requirement.
*  The vulnerability was addressed in SQLite version 3.13.0.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered if the application does a chdir() to a unsafe directory.
*   The vulnerable code is in `src/os_unix.c`.

**In summary, CVE-2016-6153 is a local vulnerability that arises from incorrect temporary directory selection in SQLite on Unix-like systems. This could lead to data leaks, denial of service, or undefined behaviors due to improper handling of directory permissions and fallback behavior.**
