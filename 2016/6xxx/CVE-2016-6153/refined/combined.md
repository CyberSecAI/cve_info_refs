KL-001-2016-003 : SQLite Tempdir Selection Vulnerability
Title: SQLite Tempdir Selection Vulnerability
Advisory ID: KL-001-2016-003
Publication Date: 2016.07.01
Publication URL: https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2016-003.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: SQLite/Hwaci
Affected Product: SQLite
Affected Version: All versions prior to 3.13.0
Platform: UNIX, GNU/Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory
with Incorrect Permissions
Impact: Data Leakage
Attack vector: Local
2. Vulnerability Description
Usually processes writing to temporary directories do not need to
perform readdir() because they control the filenames they create, so
setting /tmp/ , /var/tmp/ , etc. to be mode 1733 is a not uncommon
UNIX hardening practice.
Affected versions of SQLite reject potential tempdir locations if
they are not readable, falling back to '.'. Thus, SQLite will favor
e.g. using cwd for tempfiles on such a system, even if cwd is an
unsafe location. Notably, SQLite also checks the permissions of '.',
but ignores the results of that check.
By itself, this is only a POLA (Principle of Least Astonishment)
violation that may cause unexpected failures. However, this might
in turn cause software that uses SQLite libraries to behave in
unsafe ways, leaking sensitive data, opening up SQLite libraries to
attack by deliberately corrupted tempfiles, etc.
3. Technical Description
SQLite creates tempfiles only under certain specific circumstances,
and the behavior is tunable in various ways; see
https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html for more background.
Generally speaking, the below does not apply for rollback journals,
master journals, write-ahead log (WAL) files, or shared-memory
(-shm) files. They may apply for various other tempfile types.
When a tempfile must be created, sanity checks are performed on
candidate tempdir locations; these checks are flawed.
src/os\_unix.c (which is merged into sqlite3.c during the
release-tarball preparation process) performs these checks when
considering candidate temporary directory locations (quoted from
commit 0064a8c77b, 2016-02-23):
/\*
\*\* Return the name of a directory in which to put temporary files.
\*\* If no suitable temporary file directory can be found, return NULL.
\*/
static const char \*unixTempFileDir(void){
static const char \*azDirs[] = {
0,
0,
"/var/tmp",
"/usr/tmp",
"/tmp",
"."
};
unsigned int i;
struct stat buf;
const char \*zDir = sqlite3\_temp\_directory;
if( !azDirs[0] ) azDirs[0] = getenv("SQLITE\_TMPDIR");
if( !azDirs[1] ) azDirs[1] = getenv("TMPDIR");
for(i=0; i CREATE TEMP TABLE testtemp(text);

 parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both

 reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features

 that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for

 use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or

 embedded controllers.

>>      Affected Vendor: SQLite/Hwaci
>>      Affected Product: SQLite
>>      Affected Version: All versions prior to 3.13.0
>>      Platform: UNIX, GNU/Linux
>>      CWE Classification: CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory
>>                          with Incorrect Permissions
>>      Impact: Data Leakage

Name : sqlite
Product : Fedora 24
Version : 3.13.0

supporting a separate database server. Version 2 and version 3 binaries
are named to permit each to be installed on a single host

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-04 07:47:49 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of Fedora.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.  [bug automatically created by: add-tracking-bugs]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-04 07:47:55 UTC  ```  Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1352437,1352440  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [CVE-2016-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6153)  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440#c2)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-07-25 21:33:47 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 24 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 2 (two) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 24. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '24'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 24 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440#c3)  Jan Kurik    2017-08-08 11:32:30 UTC  ``` Fedora 24 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2017-08-08. Fedora 24 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates.  As this is a security big we are moving this bug to the currently latest supported release. Please check whether this bug is still applicable.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440#c4)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:13:28 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '25'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 25 is end of life.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440#c5)  Jan Kurik    2018-05-31 07:37:04 UTC  ``` This bug has been reported against a Fedora version which is already unsuported. In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.  [1] <https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1736>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440#c6)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 15:21:28 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.

# [R3] PVS 5.2.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable's Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) uses third-party libraries to provide certain standardized functionality. Four of these libraries were found to contain vulnerabilities and were fixed upstream. Those fixes have been integrated despite there being no known exploitation scenarios related to PVS.

* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* SQLite Insecure Temporary Directory Usage Local Issue
* Expat XML Parser Input Document Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c XML\_GetBuffer() Function Compressed XML Content Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c generate\_hash\_secret\_salt() Function PRNG Non-random Output Generation Weakness
* Expat xmlparse.c Hash Table Collision DoS
* jQuery UI dialog() Function closeText Parameter XSS

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the OpenSSL integration into PVS and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact PVS at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that PVS be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

Additionally, a reflected XSS vulnerability affecting the PVS Web GUI was fixed in the HTML 1.7.1 and Web Server 1.8.0 updates delivered via the plugin feed on November 14, 2016. A default install of PVS 5.2.0 includes these fixes. This issue was reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

### Solution

Tenable has released version 5.2.0 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), jQuery UI (1.12.0), Expat (2.2.0), and SQLite (3.13.0), which are not affected. The new version is available at:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mingw-sqlite
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 3.26.0.0
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <http://www.sqlite.org/>
Summary : MinGW Windows port of sqlite embeddable SQL database engine
Description :
SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and
flexibility of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of
supporting a separate database server. Version 2 and version 3 binaries
are named to permit each to be installed on a single host

This package contains cross-compiled libraries and development tools
for Windows.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1558808#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-21 04:05:34 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1558808#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-21 04:05:41 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1558804,1558808  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1558808#c2)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 16:32:33 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1558808#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-02-07 19:59:15 UTC  ``` mingw-sqlite-3.26.0.0-1.fc29 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-49f80a78bc>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1558808#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-02-10 04:28:10 UTC  ``` mingw-sqlite-3.26.0.0-1.fc29 has been pushed to the Fedora 29 testing repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report. See [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for instructions on how to install test updates. You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-49f80a78bc>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1558808#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-08-13 01:58:43 UTC  ``` mingw-sqlite-3.26.0.0-1.fc29 has been pushed to the Fedora 29 stable repository.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

> 1. Vulnerability Details

>      Affected Vendor: SQLite/Hwaci
>      Affected Product: SQLite
>      Affected Version: All versions prior to 3.13.0
>      Platform: UNIX, GNU/Linux
>      CWE Classification: CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory
>                          with Incorrect Permissions
>      Impact: Data Leakage
>      Attack vector: Local

Release notes say:
> Change the temporary directory search algorithm
> <<http://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html#tempdir>> on Unix to allow
> directories with write and execute permission, but without read
> permission, to serve as temporary directories. Apply this same
> standard to the "." fallback directory.

The covering commits seem to be:

<http://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/67985761aa93fb61>
Change the temporary directory search algorithm on unix so that directories with only -wx permission are allowed. And do not allow "." to be returned if it lacks -wx permission.

<http://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/b38fe522cfc971b3>
Fix the fix to the temporary directory search algorithm so that it continues to return "." as a fallback if that directory has the correct permissions.

<http://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/614bb709d34e1148>
Fix the temporary directory search algorithm for unix so that it fails gracefully even if all candidate directories are inaccessible. This fixes a bug that was introduced by check-in [9b8fec60d8e].

Can a CVE please be assigned for this issue?

Thanks,
Andreas

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1352437#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-04 07:47:10 UTC  ``` It was found that temporary directory search algorithm doesn't allow directories with only -wx permissions on Unix. Instead it falls back to '.' even if it's unsafe location. Although permissions of '.' are checked, result of that check is ignored.  Upstream patch:  <https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/67985761aa93fb61> <https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/b38fe522cfc971b3> <https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/614bb709d34e1148>  CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/1>  External References:  <https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2016-003.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1352437#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-04 07:48:18 UTC  ```  Created sqlite2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1352439](show_bug.cgi?id=1352439 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-6153 sqlite2: sqlite: Tempdir selection vulnerability [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1352443](show_bug.cgi?id=1352443 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-6153 sqlite2: sqlite: Tempdir selection vulnerability [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1352437#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-04 07:48:26 UTC  ```  Created sqlite tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1352438](show_bug.cgi?id=1352438 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6153 sqlite: Tempdir selection vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1352437#c3)  Adam Mariš    2016-07-04 07:48:33 UTC  ```  Created mingw-sqlite tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1352440](show_bug.cgi?id=1352440 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6153 mingw-sqlite: sqlite: Tempdir selection vulnerability [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1352442](show_bug.cgi?id=1352442 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-6153 mingw-sqlite: sqlite: Tempdir selection vulnerability [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1352437#c4)  Doran Moppert    2016-07-06 03:01:45 UTC  ``` The impact of this issue is certainly low, if it can even be considered a security flaw.  The hard-coded temp dir search path follows:    1. temp_store_directory pragma (if defined)   2. SQLITE_TMPDIR environment var   3. TMPDIR env var   4. /var/tmp   5. /usr/tmp   6. /tmp  Only if all of these are exhausted is the cwd used.  The impact of this bug is such that directories with permissions (relative to the user) of exactly -wx (writable, searchable but not readable) will be erroneously skipped.  Finally, a randomly-generated filename is used, appropriate permissions (0600) and open(2) flags are used, and the file is unlinked once sqlite is finished with it.  RHEL ships by default with mode 1777 on /var/tmp, /usr/tmp and /tmp.  For this flaw to have any impact on a RHEL system:    - the sysadmin would need to have changed permissions on all three tmp directories   - the affected application would need to chdir() to a dangerous location:  in particular, a network share with poor permissions management, or removable media   - the application would need to use VACUUM, a temp database, a materialized view, statement journals or transient indices involving sensitive data   - an attacker would need to race to access the file, or recover it from deleted blocks  RHEL's builds of sqlite do not override any default options nor patch the source in a way that impacts this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1352437#c6)  Fedora Update System    2016-07-14 14:50:54 UTC  ``` sqlite-3.13.0-1.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

## SQLite Release 3.13.0 On 2016-05-18

1. Postpone I/O associated with TEMP files for as long as possible, with the hope
   that the I/O can ultimately be avoided completely.- Merged the [session](../sessionintro.html) extension into trunk.- Added the ".auth ON|OFF" command to the [command-line shell](../cli.html).- Added the "--indent" option to the ".schema" and ".fullschema" commands of
         the [command-line shell](../cli.html), to turn on pretty-printing.- Added the ".eqp full" option to the [command-line shell](../cli.html), that does both [EXPLAIN](../lang_explain.html)
           and [EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN](../eqp.html) on each statement that is evaluated.- Improved unicode filename handling in the [command-line shell](../cli.html) on Windows.- Improved resistance against goofy query planner decisions caused by
               incomplete or incorrect modifications to the [sqlite\_stat1](../fileformat2.html#stat1tab)
               table by the application.- Added the [sqlite3\_db\_config](../c3ref/db_config.html)(db,[SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_ENABLE\_LOAD\_EXTENSION](../c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigenableloadextension)) interface
                 which allows the [sqlite3\_load\_extension()](../c3ref/load_extension.html) C-API to be enabled while keeping the
                 [load\_extension()](../lang_corefunc.html#load_extension) SQL function disabled for security.- Change the [temporary directory search algorithm](../tempfiles.html#tempdir) on Unix to allow directories with
                   write and execute permission, but without read permission, to serve as temporary
                   directories. Apply this same standard to the "." fallback directory.

                   **Bug Fixes:**- Fix a problem with the multi-row one-pass DELETE optimization that was
                     causing it to compute incorrect answers with a self-referential subquery in
                     the WHERE clause. Fix for ticket
                     [dc6ebeda9396087](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/dc6ebeda9396087)- Fix a possible segfault with DELETE when table is a [rowid table](../rowidtable.html) with an
                       [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](../lang_createtable.html#rowid) and the WHERE clause contains a OR and
                       the table has one or more indexes that are able to trigger the OR optimization,
                       but none of the indexes reference any table columns other than the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.
                       Ticket [16c9801ceba49](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/16c9801ceba49).- When checking for the [WHERE-clause push-down optimization](../optoverview.html#pushdown), verify that all terms
                         of the compound inner SELECT are non-aggregate, not just the last term. Fix for ticket

Debian Bug     :

Two vulnerabilities have been fixed in sqlite (V2) which which might
allow local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of
service (application crash), or have unspecified other impact.

CVE-2016-6153

sqlite improperly implemented the temporary directory search algorithm,
which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a
denial of service (application crash), or have unspecified other impact
by leveraging use of the current working directory for temporary files.

CVE-2018-8740

Databases whose schema is corrupted using a CREATE TABLE AS statement
could cause a NULL pointer dereference,

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.8.17-15+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sqlite packages.

For the detailed security status of sqlite please refer to
its security tracker page at:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=987394#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-01 16:07:40 UTC  ``` KL-001-2016-003 : SQLite Tempdir Selection Vulnerability  Title: SQLite Tempdir Selection Vulnerability Advisory ID: KL-001-2016-003 Publication Date: 2016.07.01 Publication URL: <https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2016-003.txt>   1. Vulnerability Details       Affected Vendor: SQLite/Hwaci      Affected Product: SQLite      Affected Version: All versions prior to 3.13.0      Platform: UNIX, GNU/Linux      CWE Classification: CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory                          with Incorrect Permissions      Impact: Data Leakage      Attack vector: Local  2. Vulnerability Description       Usually processes writing to temporary directories do not need to      perform readdir() because they control the filenames they create, so      setting /tmp/ , /var/tmp/ , etc. to be mode 1733 is a not uncommon      UNIX hardening practice.       Affected versions of SQLite reject potential tempdir locations if      they are not readable, falling back to '.'.  Thus, SQLite will favor      e.g. using cwd for tempfiles on such a system, even if cwd is an      unsafe location.  Notably, SQLite also checks the permissions of '.',      but ignores the results of that check.       By itself, this is only a POLA (Principle of Least Astonishment)      violation that may cause unexpected failures.  However, this might      in turn cause software that uses SQLite libraries to behave in      unsafe ways, leaking sensitive data, opening up SQLite libraries to      attack by deliberately corrupted tempfiles, etc.   3. Technical Description       SQLite creates tempfiles only under certain specific circumstances,      and the behavior is tunable in various ways; see      <https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html> for more background.      Generally speaking, the below does not apply for rollback journals,      master journals, write-ahead log (WAL) files, or shared-memory      (-shm) files.  They may apply for various other tempfile types.       When a tempfile must be created, sanity checks are performed on      candidate tempdir locations; these checks are flawed.       src/os_unix.c (which is merged into sqlite3.c during the      release-tarball preparation process) performs these checks when      considering candidate temporary directory locations (quoted from      commit 0064a8c77b, 2016-02-23):         /*        ** Return the name of a directory in which to put temporary files.        ** If no suitable temporary file directory can be found, return NULL.        */        static const char *unixTempFileDir(void){          static const char *azDirs[] = {             0,             0,             "/var/tmp",             "/usr/tmp",             "/tmp",             "."          };          unsigned int i;          struct stat buf;          const char *zDir = sqlite3_temp_directory;           if( !azDirs[0] ) azDirs[0] = getenv("SQLITE_TMPDIR");          if( !azDirs[1] ) azDirs[1] = getenv("TMPDIR");          for(i=0; i<sizeof(azDirs)/sizeof(azDirs[0]); zDir=azDirs[i++]){            if( zDir==0 ) continue;            if( osStat(zDir, &buf) ) continue;            if( !S_ISDIR(buf.st_mode) ) continue;            if( osAccess(zDir, 07) ) continue;            break;          }          return zDir;        }       osAccess is defined elsewhere as a wrapper around the access system      call:           { "access",       (sqlite3_syscall_ptr)access,     0  },        #define osAccess    ((int(*)(const char*,int))aSyscall[2].pCurrent)       So, a candidate directory will be rejected if it does not match mode      07; that is to say it must be readable, writable, and executable.       Furthermore, the comment that "If no suitable temporary file      directory can be found, return NULL." is incorrect: in fact, if all      directories including "." fail, then "." is returned, because zDir      has already been assigned before the checks fail.  (Also,      unixGetTempname, which calls unixTempFileDir, does not check if NULL      was returned.)       The specific lines of code embodying this check have subtly changed      a dozen times over SQLite's history (and things like the NULL check      might have been valid in some past version).  The first time a check      for readability was included appears to have been in fossil commit      e7b65e37fd, imported from this CVS commit:         -** @(#) $Id: KL-001-2016-003.txt,v 1.1 2016/07/01 15:48:13 hlein Exp $        +** @(#) $Id: KL-001-2016-003.txt,v 1.1 2016/07/01 15:48:13 hlein Exp $             for(i=0; i<sizeof(azDirs)/sizeof(azDirs[0]); i++){        -    if( stat(azDirs[i], &buf)==0 && S_ISDIR(buf.st_mode)        -         && access(azDirs[i], W_OK) ){        -       return azDirs[i];        -    }        +    if( stat(azDirs[i], &buf) ) continue;        +    if( !S_ISDIR(buf.st_mode) ) continue;        +    if( access(azDirs[i], 07) ) continue;        +    return azDirs[i];           }       As seen here, prior to 2001.09.14 the only permission checked was      W_OK, writability.  The commit message for e7b65e37fd does not call      out this change; perhaps there was some problem that changing from      W_OK to R_OK+W_OK+X_OK was intended to solve at the time.       As stated above, this by itself is only a POLA violation: a      developer or system administrator might not expect a candidate      temporary directory to be rejected if it is not readable.  This      would result in SQLITE_TMPDIR , TMPDIR , /var/tmp , /tmp , etc.      being rejected by the above if they are mode 1733 or similar, and      also cause sqlite to fail at runtime if cwd is not writable.       SQLite does the right things when creating its tempfile, once the      tempdir is chosen.  It randomly generates the filename (although      weirdly, using a home-grown implementation instead of mkstemp,      possibly for cross-platform purposes), uses file mode 600, with good      file-open flags (O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC), etc.  If      possible (such as for 'TEMP' databases), the file is unlinked      immediately.       However, this could lead to insecure behavior by some application      using SQLite under these conditions.  As a contrived example, a      program which writes sensitive data to an sqlite database, and      during execution chdir()'s to a directory in which it is not safe to      write sensitive data even temporarily, such as an NFS or SMB network      share (allowing network capture), or a removable device which will      later leave the user's physical control (leaving on-disk residue,      possibly mitigated by SQLite's SECURE_DELETE settings).       It is also possible that the failure of unixTempFileDir to return      NULL, and of unixGetTempname to check for that NULL, may lead to      abrupt crashes or otherwise unexpected or undefined behavior by the      calling program when "." is also not writable.  4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation       The vendor released version 3.13.0 on 2016.05.18 in which the reported      vulnerability was patched. Release notes available at:      <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_13_0.html>  5. Credit       This vulnerability was discovered by Hank Leininger of KoreLogic, Inc.  6.

This fixes a bug that was introduced by check-in [9b8fec60d8e]. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=987394#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-01 21:09:02 UTC  ``` CVE-2016-6153 was assigned to this issue <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/1> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=987394#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-07-01 22:00:28 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=987394#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-07-04 11:18:58 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

The code for SLE11-SP0 is quite different and would need more backporting and testing effort, so please let me know if we need it for this (or anything else) as well. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=987394#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-22 14:09:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to Reinhard Max from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=987394#c5)) > The code for SLE11-SP0 is quite different and would need more backporting > and testing effort, so please let me know if we need it for this (or > anything else) as well.  Do not progress further, as on second consideration the vulnerability has somewhat esoteric triggers. We'll take the submitted ones. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=987394#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-08-01 03:13:43 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:1932-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
