  "CVE-2016-6291": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds access vulnerability in the `exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE` function due to a lack of size check of the buffer. Specifically, the `offset_diff` calculation uses attacker-controlled values `NumDirEntries` and the output from the `php_ifd_get32u` function, which could result in `offset_diff` being out of the allocated buffer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Integer overflow",
      "Lack of size check"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially trigger a memory buffer overflow, leading to information disclosure or memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted JPG image, when read by the PHP script using the `exif_read_data()` function, can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to cause a vulnerable PHP script to process a crafted JPEG image."
