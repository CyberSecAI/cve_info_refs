- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Curve25519 code invoked undefined behavior on systems without a native 128-bit integer type.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Undefined behavior due to the lack of a native 128-bit integer type.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The undefined behavior was known to produce incorrect results on 32-bit ARM when compiled by Clang.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs due to the lack of a native 128-bit integer type leading to incorrect calculations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger the Curve25519 code on an affected platform (e.g. 32-bit ARM).
