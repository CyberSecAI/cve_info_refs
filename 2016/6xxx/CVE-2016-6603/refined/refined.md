Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-6603:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper session management in WebNMS. Specifically, the application allows an attacker to set an arbitrary "UserName" HTTP header in a request, which the server then uses to generate an authenticated session cookie for that specified user. This allows for user impersonation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure session handling:** The application trusts the `UserName` header value without proper validation or authentication, directly associating the session with the user specified in the header.
- **Lack of authentication enforcement:** The server does not verify that the user is actually who they claim to be based on the `UserName` header, which is not an authenticated piece of data.
- **User impersonation:** By exploiting the insecure session handling, an attacker can effectively log in as any user, including the "root" superuser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full administrative access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain administrative access to the WebNMS server by impersonating the superuser, allowing them to perform any administrative action. This includes the potential for system compromise, data manipulation, and further attacks.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability risks:** Gaining the ability to execute commands as an administrative user can lead to severe disruption or manipulation of the server, its services, and the data stored within.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote network attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the `GetChallengeServlet`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated attacker:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WebNMS server.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request with a specific header.
