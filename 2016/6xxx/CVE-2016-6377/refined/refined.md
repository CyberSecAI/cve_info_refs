Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-6377:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the application programming interface (API) for the Platform and Applications Manager (PAM) of the Cisco Virtual Media Packager (VMP). Specifically, it allows unauthorized access to the PAM API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication for the PAM API, allowing unauthenticated access. This violates the principle of least privilege by allowing access without verifying identity or permissions.
- **CWE-287 Improper Authentication**:  This vulnerability is classified under CWE-287, indicating that the issue stems from insufficient or lacking authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain access to the PAM API.
- The impact is partial for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:P/I:P/A:P), based on the CVSS score. This suggests the attacker could potentially read sensitive data, modify configurations, or disrupt services related to the PAM API functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is **network-based** (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network connection.
- The attack requires **medium complexity** (AC:M) which could be due to timing issues, specific network configurations, or other environmental constraints.
- **No authentication** (Au:N) is required for the attacker.
- The PAM API is only accessible using the SSL or TLS protocol, however, this does not mitigate the authentication issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a network connection to the affected Cisco VMP instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the exposed PAM API.
- No prior authentication is needed, making it easier to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Virtual Media Packager (VMP) using Media Origination System Suite Software versions 2.6 and prior.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
- A fix is available through software upgrades, which are documented in the linked Cisco Bug ID.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8 and a temporal score of 5.6, indicating a moderate severity. The exploitability is classified as functional (E:F), meaning that working exploit code is likely available. The report confidence is confirmed (RC:C), indicating the vendor is aware and has acknowledged the vulnerability.
