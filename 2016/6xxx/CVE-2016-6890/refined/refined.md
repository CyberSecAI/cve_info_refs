Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-6890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper parsing of the Subject Alt Name field within X.509 certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the SSL stack.
- For devices like routers, this could lead to complete system compromise with root privileges.
- Potential for remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted X.509 certificate to a vulnerable server during client authentication (or any process where untrusted X.509 certificates are processed).
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed Subject Alt Name field within the X.509 certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send network traffic to a server that is using a vulnerable version of MatrixSSL.
- No prior authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious X.509 certificate.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzz testing using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- Affected versions of MatrixSSL are 3.8.5 and earlier.
- The fix is included in MatrixSSL version 3.8.6.
- The same researcher also discovered a buffer over-read (CVE-2016-6891) and improper free (CVE-2016-6892) in the same library.
