Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `vmxnet3_complete_packet` function within the VMXNET3 network device emulator of QEMU. Specifically, the local variable `txcq_descr` was not initialized before being used. This resulted in the potential leakage of host memory to the guest.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. Due to the uninitialized `txcq_descr` variable, a guest VM can potentially read data from host memory when the `vmxnet3_complete_packet` function is called.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A privileged user within the guest VM can potentially access sensitive information from the host system's memory, which could include other guest VM's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Guest VM:** The attack vector is from within a guest virtual machine using the VMXNET3 network adapter emulation.
- **Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing the transmit queue and reaches the end of a packet, which calls the `vmxnet3_complete_packet` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged Access within Guest VM:** The attacker needs to have privileged access (e.g., root) within the guest operating system to trigger the vulnerability.
- **VMXNET3 Device Usage:** The guest VM must be configured to use the VMXNET3 network device emulation in QEMU.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided patch addresses the issue by adding a `memset` call to initialize the `txcq_descr` variable before it's used, preventing the leak.
- The vulnerability was reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Inc.

**Summary:** A vulnerability exists in QEMU's VMXNET3 network device emulation where an uninitialized variable could lead to information leakage from the host system to a privileged user within a guest VM.
