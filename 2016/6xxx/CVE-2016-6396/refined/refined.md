Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the malicious file detection and blocking features of Cisco Firepower Management Center and Cisco FireSIGHT System Software. Specifically, a flaw exists in how these systems handle file policies configured to "Block Malware with all options including Reset".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The core issue is that the software does not properly validate or sanitize input, allowing an attacker to craft malicious files in a way that bypasses the malware detection mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malware Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the malware detection mechanisms. This means malicious files could potentially be delivered through the system without being detected and blocked.
- **Integrity Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a "Partial" Integrity Impact (I:P) meaning that a successful attack could lead to a modification of the intended behavior of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Network-Based Attack (AV:N):** The attack is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through network communication.
- **Unauthenticated Access (Au:N):** An attacker doesn't need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious file(s) that are designed to bypass the detection mechanism.
- No specific position or access level within the network is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Cisco Firepower Management Center and FireSIGHT System Software versions prior to Release 6.1.
- No workarounds are available, and the solution involves upgrading to a fixed software version.
- There was no public announcement or evidence of malicious use known at the time of the advisory.

This information is more detailed than the placeholder description in the CVE record and provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
