Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6815:

**CVE-2016-6815: Apache Ranger user privilege vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:  The vulnerability stems from insufficient privilege validation in the backend. Users with the "keyadmin" role were incorrectly allowed to change passwords for users with the "admin" role, which should not be permitted.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Improper access control and privilege escalation. The system fails to enforce the correct separation of administrative roles, allowing a user with lower privileges ("keyadmin") to potentially impact higher-privileged accounts ("admin").

*  **Impact of Exploitation**: A user with the "keyadmin" role could potentially change the password of "admin" users, leading to a compromise of admin accounts, denial of service, and unauthorized access to administrative functions and resources.

*   **Attack Vectors**: This vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with the "keyadmin" role through the user management interface or related API calls used to change user passwords.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to have an account with the "keyadmin" role within the Apache Ranger system.

*   **Fix Detail**:  The fix involves adding logic to validate the user privilege in the backend, ensuring "keyadmin" users are unable to modify passwords of "admin" users.

*   **Affected Versions**: All 0.5.x versions and 0.6.0/0.6.1 versions of Apache Ranger.

*   **Mitigation**: Upgrade to version 0.6.2 or later.
