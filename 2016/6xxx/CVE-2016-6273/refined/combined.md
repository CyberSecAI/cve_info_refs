# [R2] Citrix License Server / Flexera FlexNet Publisher lmadmin.exe 2F Packet Handling Remote DoS

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While working on detection plugins for the Nessus vulnerability scanner, we identified a new issue in Citrix License Server and Flexera Flex License Manager (now FlexNet Publisher). This is potentially due to a partial or incomplete fix for the vulnerability in [specified by CVE-2015-8277](https://securitymumblings.blogspot.com/2016/02/cve-2015-8277.html), or it may be a similar issue in a different binary.

It appears that the Citrix license server runs `lmadmin.exe` rather than `lmgrd.exe`, which is probably an important detail considering we could not crash or cause remote code execution using the method outlined in the original research with an older (unpatched) version of the license manager, and they may not in fact be affected by it though we could not confirm this. Due to the convoluted nature of the relationship between Flexera License Manager, Flexera Publisher, and the various Citrix software (much of which shares the same version scheme), it isn't clear where the fault lies. If we had to guess, we'd say this is most likely a flaw in Citrix License Server building against the outdated Flexera version, or perhaps a flaw in Flexera via a different service/binary than previously disclosed. As such, we'll get both companies involved.

This issue was discovered while fuzzing the Citrix License Server and was found in the `lmadmin.exe` image, and appears to be related to the binary passing some invalid arguments to an STL Container. Based on a cursory examination, this is unlikely to be a vector for remote code execution, and just a silly magic packet remote DoS. #sadpanda This was tested against freshly installed Citrix License Servers (i.e. they were serving no licenses at the time) on Windows 2012 R2 systems.

When the `lmadmin.exe` service encounters a type `2F` packet with a '`01 19`' op code, the service would immediately crash, requiring a restart by an administrator. Since the software uses a proprietary binary-based protocol without public documentation, it isn't clear if these are considered 'malformed' packets, or if they are legitimate packets and the service wasn't designed to expect them. Hex dump of packet sent:

```

00000000: 2F C4 3A 1C 00 25 01 19  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  /.:..%..........
00000010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
00000020: 00 00 00 00 00                                    .....

```

Tenable has developed a Python 2.7 proof of concept script (`citrix_is_flexible.py`), that does not require any special packages. We are sharing it with the two vendors, but not you. Sorry =(

### Solution

Both Citrix and Flexera have released new versions that mitigate this issue. The following packages were provided by the respective vendors, which show some name changes in the products as well.

* Citrix License Server for Windows 11.14.0.1
* Citrix License Server VPX 11.14.0.1
* FlexNet Publisher 2015 SP5
* FlexNet Publisher 2016 R1 SP1

Additionally, Flexera asked us to share some reminders and caveats about this issue, so we're doing that for them.

+ This DoS issue is applicable to all users of the `lmadmin` component of FlexNet Publisher (not just users of the Citrix products which distribute `lmadmin`)
+ It is applicable to all supported versions of `lmadmin`
+ A low percentage of FlexNet Publisher customers distribute `lmadmin` to their customers (although Citrix is part of that low percentage), a high percentage distribute `lmgrd` which is a legacy equivalent to `lmadmin`, and a small percentage of customers do not distribute either `lmadmin` or `lmgrd`
+ Therefore, a workaround is to use `lmgrd` instead of `lmadmin`
+ `lmadmin` is not to be exposed to the Internet
+ Flexera Software has published a knowledge article about this issue which is available to all FlexNet Publisher customers on maintenance
+ Those FlexNet Publisher customers (like Citrix) who distribute `lmadmin` to their customers must wait until Flexera Software distributes the patched `lmadmin` to them, then they (e.g. Citrix) must re-distribute the patched `lmadmin` to their customers.
