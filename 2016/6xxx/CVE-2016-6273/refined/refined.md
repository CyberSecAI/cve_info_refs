Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by the `lmadmin.exe` component of Flexera FlexNet Publisher (also known as Flex License Manager) improperly handling certain network packets. Specifically, when the service encounters a type `2F` packet with a '`01 19`' op code, it crashes due to what appears to be the binary passing invalid arguments to an STL Container. This is possibly due to an incomplete fix for a similar issue in CVE-2015-8277 or a new issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The service doesn't properly validate or handle the specific type `2F` packet with the opcode `01 19`, causing a crash.
- **STL Container Issue:** The underlying cause of the crash is likely due to the service passing invalid arguments to an STL container, which leads to a denial of service.
- **Proprietary Protocol:** The use of a proprietary binary-based protocol without public documentation makes it difficult to assess whether the packets are malformed or if the service was simply not designed to handle them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the `lmadmin.exe` service. This requires an administrator to manually restart the service, leading to service interruption and potential license unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted network packet (type `2F` with opcode `01 19`) to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the service. This could be an attacker on the same local network or potentially an attacker from a remote network if the service is exposed.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack doesn't appear to require any form of authentication.
- **No Special privileges:** The attack can be done with a crafted packet and no special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects the `lmadmin.exe` component of FlexNet Publisher, which is used by various products, including Citrix License Server.
-  While the text mentioned an older version of the license manager (`lmgrd.exe`) not being affected, there was no confirmation of the same, also the services use different binaries.
- Although the research identified that the issue is unlikely to allow for remote code execution (RCE), it does allow for a remote DoS condition.
