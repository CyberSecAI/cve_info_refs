Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6546:

**CVE-2016-6546: Base64 Encoded Password**

*   **Root Cause:** The iTrack Easy mobile application stores the user's account password in a base64-encoded format within the `cache.db` file. Although encoded, base64 is easily reversible, which is effectively equivalent to storing the password in cleartext.
*   **Weakness:**  Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information. Specifically, the password is not encrypted before storage, but is instead just base64 encoded which does not offer real protection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who gains access to the device's file system could easily decode the base64 password and potentially use it to access the user's iTrack account. Due to password reuse, this could also compromise other online accounts.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    * Local access to the device's file system. An attacker could obtain the `cache.db` file from a compromised mobile device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs access to the file system of the mobile device where the iTrack Easy application is installed.
    * No network access required to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text specifies that the base64 encoded format is considered equivalent to cleartext storage due to the ease of decoding, which is more detailed than the official CVE description.
* The vulnerability is specific to the iTrack Easy mobile application.
* The vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities found in multiple BLE tracker devices as indicated by the context from the blog post.
