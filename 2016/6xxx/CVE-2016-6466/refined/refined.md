Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* A vulnerability exists in the IPsec component of StarOS for Cisco ASR 5000 Series routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
* It is related to improper handling of IPsec tunnel management within the StarOS software.
* The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-399 which refers to resource management issues, often leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    * Terminate all active IPsec VPN tunnels.
    * Prevent new IPsec tunnels from being established.
    * Result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is remote and network-based (AV:N).
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated (Au:N).
* The attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco ASR 5000 series routers.
* The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special credentials.
* The attacker needs to send specific network packets or manipulate the IPsec component to trigger the vulnerability, which based on the "Exploitability" of Functional (E:F), indicates that functional exploit code is available.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 5000/5500 Series routers and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core (VPC).
* There are no known workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
* A fix is available in updated software releases, which can be identified through Cisco Bug ID CSCva13631.
* The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of public exploitation.

In summary, CVE-2016-6466 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to disrupt IPsec VPN connectivity on affected Cisco devices, leading to a denial of service.
