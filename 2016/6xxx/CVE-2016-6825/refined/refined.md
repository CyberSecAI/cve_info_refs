- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of authentication protection mechanisms in Huawei servers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Brute-force cracking vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker may obtain user passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the device network. The attacker does not need any special privileges besides network accessibility to the vulnerable service.
