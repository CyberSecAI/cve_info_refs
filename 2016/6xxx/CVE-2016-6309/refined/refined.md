  "CVE-2016-6309": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where, if a message larger than approximately 16KB is received, the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. A dangling pointer to the old location is left, resulting in an attempt to write to the previously freed location.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
       "Dangling pointer"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote"
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a crafted TLS session with a message larger than approximately 16KB."
