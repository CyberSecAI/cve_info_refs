| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 9.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 9.0 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Email Security Appliance Internal Testing Interface Vulnerability Critical   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160922-esa  First Published: 2016 September 22 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2016 October 4 13:26 GMT  Version 1.2:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvb26017](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvb26017)     CVE-2016-6406        CVSS Score: [Base 10.0, Temporal 9.0](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:W/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:W/RC:C       CVE-2016-6406        Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in Cisco IronPort AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain complete control of an affected device.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco ESA physical and virtual devices running any of the following software releases are affected by this vulnerability:   + 9.1.2-023   + 9.1.2-028   + 9.1.2-036   + 9.7.2-046   + 9.7.2-047   + 9.7-2-054   + 10.0.0-124   + 10.0.0-125To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can use the **version** command in the ESA command-line interface (CLI). The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.7-044:      ciscoesa> **version**   Current Version   ===============   Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance   Model: X1070   Version: 8.5.7-044   .   .   .      Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes the ESA and the Security Management Appliance (SMA) as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:   + Cloud Email Security (CES) service   + Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) - virtual and physical devices   + Web Security Appliance (WSA) - virtual and physical devices  Details  * A vulnerability in Cisco IronPort AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain complete control of an affected device.      The vulnerability is due to the presence of a Cisco internal testing and debugging interface (intended for use during product manufacturing only) on customer-available software releases. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to this testing and debugging interface. An exploit could allow an attacker to obtain complete control of an affected device with *root*-level privileges.      Only Cisco ESA devices that meet all of the following conditions are affected by this vulnerability:   + The device is running one of the previously listed affected software releases, and   + The device has been rebooted *at most once* since one of the previously listed affected software releases was installed, and   + The device's Enrollment Client component version is *earlier* than version 1.0.2-065A device that has been rebooted two or more times after installation of an affected software release is *not affected* by this vulnerability, as the interface becomes disabled and unavailable after the second device reboot.      On Friday, September 15, 2016, Cisco Systems made available an Enrollment Client update for ESA devices. This update, once installed, disabled the internal testing interface. Any ESA device running one of the previously listed affected software releases but with this update installed is *not affected* by this vulnerability.      In order to verify if an ESA device downloaded and installed the update, execute the **ecstatus** command. The following example shows an ESA appliance with an Enrollment Client version of 1.0.2-062: ```   ciscoesa> ecstatus      Component                 Version    Last Updated   Enrollment Client         1.0.2-062  30 Aug 2016 12:21 (GMT +00:00)      ciscoesa>      ``` ESA devices with an Enrollment Client component version 1.0.2-065 or later are not vulnerable, as the internal testing interface has been disabled. The previous example shows an ESA appliance that has *not* installed the required update, as the version displayed is below 1.0.2-065.  Indicators of Compromise  * No customer-accessible indicators of compromise are available for this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * The debugging and testing interface can be disabled by rebooting an affected device. In order to reboot an ESA device, issue the **reboot** command from the CLI. The interface will be permanently disabled and unavailable once the device has finished rebooting.      Customers concerned about the effectiveness of the workaround should open a support case with their support organization to verify the testing interface has effectively been disabled.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>.         Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.         When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.      **Customers Without Service Contracts**      Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>.         Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.         **Fixed Releases**      Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:      | **AsyncOS ESA Major Release** | **First Fixed Release** |   | --- | --- |   | 9.1.2 | 9.1.2-041 |   | 9.7.2 | 9.7.2-065 |   | 10.0.0 | 10.0.0-203 |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.
