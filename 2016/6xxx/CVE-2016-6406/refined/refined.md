Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the presence of a Cisco internal testing and debugging interface within customer-available software releases of Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA). This interface was intended for use only during product manufacturing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unprotected Debugging Interface:** A debugging interface, meant for internal use, was unintentionally left active in production software.
- **Lack of Authentication:** This interface was accessible without requiring any form of authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the affected Cisco ESA device, including *root*-level privileges.
- **Data Breach:**  Full control of the device can lead to data breaches, manipulation of email flow, and other forms of malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by connecting to the exposed testing and debugging interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Cisco ESA device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning the attacker doesn't need valid credentials to connect to the debug interface.
- **Exploitation:** The attacker needs to know how to interact with the exposed testing interface for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of Cisco AsyncOS for ESA.
- The debugging interface is only enabled for a limited time. The interface is disabled after the device has been rebooted two or more times after installing one of the vulnerable AsyncOS versions.
- Cisco released an Enrollment Client update (version 1.0.2-065 or later), which disables the internal testing interface after being installed.
- A workaround exists by rebooting the affected ESA device, which will disable the interface.
- Cisco has provided fixed software releases that address the vulnerability.
