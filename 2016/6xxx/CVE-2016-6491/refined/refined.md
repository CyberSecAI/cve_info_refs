Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `CopyMagickMemory` function within ImageMagick's `MagickCore/memory.c` file, specifically when handling 8BIM properties.
- The `Get8BIMProperty` function reads data from the input image based on the provided count, without proper validation against the image size.
- The `CopyMagickMemory` function at `MagickCore/memory.c#L696` is called with a `size` argument that is larger than the remaining data in the input image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. The `CopyMagickMemory` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer for the image, because the calculated `count` is larger than the remaining data in the image.
- **Potential memory leak**: The data read out-of-bounds is then written into the output image using `SetImageProperty`, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure/Memory Leak:** An attacker can potentially leak data from the server memory by crafting a malicious image that triggers an out-of-bounds read.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the read goes to an unmapped memory region, it could lead to a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted image file. The provided PoC files "PoC1" and "PoC2" demonstrate how to trigger the vulnerability. The crafted image contains an 8BIM property that causes `Get8BIMProperty` to request more data than available.
- **Image Processing:** The vulnerable code is triggered during image processing, particularly when handling the `-clip` option in the `convert` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to submit image for processing:** The attacker needs to be able to submit an image to ImageMagick for processing, typically through an application or service that uses ImageMagick for image manipulation.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** An attacker needs to know how to craft an image that will trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `Get8BIMProperty` function, specifically at `MagickCore/property.c#L697`, which calls `CopyMagickMemory` at `MagickCore/memory.c#L696`.
- The vulnerability was addressed by a patch that checks if `count` is valid before calling  `CopyMagickMemory`.
- The provided commit `dd84447b63a71fa8c3f47071b09454efc667767b` introduces these checks.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ibrahim el-sayed.
- Gentoo's security advisory (GLSA 201611-21) lists this CVE as one of several vulnerabilities in ImageMagick, noting that it can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- Oracle's Third Party Bulletin also lists this CVE as a vulnerability in ImageMagick within the Solaris operating system.
