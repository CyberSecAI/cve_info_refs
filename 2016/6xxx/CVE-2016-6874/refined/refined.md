Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6874:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient recursion checks in the `array_merge_recursive` and `array_replace_recursive` functions within Facebook's HHVM. These functions were not properly handling cases where arrays contained cycles or self-references, particularly with the `$GLOBALS` array and potentially with `ProxyArrays`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Infinite Recursion:** The lack of proper cycle detection in `array_merge_recursive` and `array_replace_recursive` could lead to infinite recursion when processing specially crafted arrays, including those containing references to themselves or other circular structures.
- **Insufficient checks:** The functions were using shortcuts and optimizations for normal arrays, not taking into account how `$GLOBALS` or `ProxyArrays` can have cycles, leading to bypasses in recursion checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Infinite recursion can exhaust server resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The server would become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker could craft a PHP script that creates a self-referential or circular array (especially using the `$GLOBALS` array or other special cases), and then triggers either `array_merge_recursive` or `array_replace_recursive` functions on this array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code on a server running a vulnerable version of HHVM. This could be through a web application that takes user-controlled input and uses `array_merge_recursive` or `array_replace_recursive`, or through direct code execution if the attacker has gained access to the server.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- **Specific functions affected:** `array_merge_recursive` and `array_replace_recursive`.
- **Vulnerable scenarios:** Self-referential arrays, circular references, specifically including the `$GLOBALS` array, and potentially `ProxyArrays`.
- **Mitigation:** The fix adds more robust checks for recursion, including explicit checks for global and proxy arrays, and uses a `PointerSet` to track visited arrays. It raises a warning and returns if recursion is detected.
- **Commit details:** The fix is located in commit `05e706d98f748f609b19d8697e490eaab5007d69` within the facebook/hhvm repository.
- **Test case:** A new test file `self_recursive.php` was added to verify the fix.
- The fix avoids recursion by checking if an array has already been processed.
- It uses a `PointerSet` (hashset of pointers) to keep track of already processed arrays.
- It checks for recursion by inserting the address of the array. If insertion fails, it means it was already processed.
