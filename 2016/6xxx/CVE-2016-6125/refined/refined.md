- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the web UI, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could alter the functionality of the web UI and potentially lead to disclosure of credentials or other sensitive information within the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the web UI by embedding malicious javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious Javascript code in the web UI. The user needs to interact with the crafted content for the exploit to be successful.
