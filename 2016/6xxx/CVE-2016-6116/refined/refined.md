- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager is missing the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security. This allows users to mistakenly navigate to the unencrypted version of the web application or accept invalid certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive data can be sent unencrypted over the network, which could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information using man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker could intercept communication between the user and the application by performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept the communication between the user and the IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager application.
