Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6545:

**CVE-2016-6545: Weak Session Management in iTrack Easy**

*   **Root Cause:** The iTrack Easy mobile application does not use session cookies for maintaining valid sessions. Instead, it transmits the user's password as a base64-encoded POST parameter (`passwd` field) over HTTPS with each request.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Lack of Session Cookies:** The absence of session cookies means that each request requires re-authentication with the user's password.
    *   **Password Transmission:** The password is sent with every request, increasing exposure.
    *   **Base64 Encoding:** The password is only base64 encoded, which is not a form of encryption and is easily reversible.
    *   **No Session Expiration:** Sessions effectively last until the user changes their password, as there's no mechanism for invalidating sessions after a timeout.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can intercept the base64-encoded password.
    *   **Account Takeover:** With the password, an attacker can gain complete control over the user's account.
    *   **Location Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify location data by using captured credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by intercepting network traffic. This is most likely over a shared or insecure WLAN.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between the iTrack Easy mobile application and the server. This can be achieved by being on the same network as the user, especially on open or public WiFi networks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives more detail than the basic CVE description. Specifically, it explains how the password is being transmitted (base64 encoded `passwd` field in POST requests) and the implications of not using session cookies.
*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note also references the same information as the rapid7 blog post
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.8 which comes from the related CVE-2016-6544 as noted in the cert advisory.
