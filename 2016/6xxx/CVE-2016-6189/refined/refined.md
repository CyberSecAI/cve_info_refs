Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of private information within ICS/XML calendar feeds when access is restricted to "View the Date & Time." SOGo used a blacklist approach to filter out sensitive information, but this proved inadequate, leading to the leakage of data that should have been restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the unintended exposure of sensitive information through calendar feeds. Specifically, the `ORGANIZER` field (revealing who invited the calendar owner) and `X-ALT-DESC` field (containing an extended copy of the description, potentially with HTML formatting) were leaked. Additional attributes beyond those intended for public view were also exposed.
- **Insufficient Filtering:** The use of a blacklist approach for filtering calendar attributes proved to be ineffective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Private Information Exposure:**  Attackers could gain access to information about calendar events, such as who organized the event, and potentially details from the extended description. This could lead to privacy violations and could be used for social engineering attacks or other malicious purposes.
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Even when users intended to only share basic "Date & Time" information, additional data could be extracted by an attacker through the calendar feed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Accessing Public ICS/XML Feeds:** The attack is carried out by fetching the ICS/XML feed of a calendar where the sharing permission was set to "View the Date & Time".
- **Analyzing the Feed:** The attacker then inspects the feed to extract the leaked fields (`ORGANIZER` , `X-ALT-DESC`, and other attributes)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to access the calendar feed. This implies that the user has some level of access to the SOGo instance
- **Knowledge of Calendar Feed URL:** The attacker needs to know or have access to the URL for the calendar's ICS/XML feed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by stripping X-tags and implementing a whitelist approach to allow only specific fields in the calendar feeds, instead of relying on a blacklist to exclude certain fields.
- The fix was implemented in SOGo versions 2.3.12 and 3.1.1.
- The issue was tracked as SOGo #3695.
- The fix also involved changes to `SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m`, `SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserSettings.h`, and `SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserSettings.m` files.
