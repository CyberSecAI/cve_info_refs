```
- Root cause of vulnerability:  The OX Guard guest reader web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized input in the "templid" parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- Impact of exploitation: Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface, such as sending mail or deleting data, if the user has an active session on the same domain.
- Attack vectors:  An attacker creates a hyperlink with malicious script code included in the `templid` parameter, which when clicked by a victim will trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick the victim into clicking the link. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
