### Description

The Crowd LDAP directory connector allowed an attacker to gain remote code execution in Crowd by injecting malicious attributes in LDAP entries. To exploit this issue, attackers need to modify an entry in your LDAP directory or successfully execute a Man-in-The-Middle attack between an LDAP server and Crowd. Crowd installations configured to communicate with an LDAP server using the **LDAPS** protocol with the **Secure SSL** option enabled are immune to this attack vector only (unless an attacker is able to obtain the private key of the SSL/TLS certificate used to secure the communication).

**Affected versions:**

* All versions of Crowd from **1.4.1** before **2.8.8** (the fixed version for 2.8.x) and from **2.9.0** before **2.9.5** (the fixed version for 2.9.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

**Fix:**

* **Crowd** 2.10.1 is available for download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/download>.
* **Crowd** 2.9.5 is available for download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/download-archive>.
* **Crowd** 2.8.8 is available for download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/download-archive>.

**Risk Mitigation:**

* The issue can be mitigated by restricting modifications of LDAP entries by LDAP users and configuring SSL/TLS connection between an LDAP Server and Crowd. See [Configuring Crowd to Work with SSL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowd/configuring-crowd-to-work-with-ssl-151520306.html) for information on setting up secure transport.

We would like to credit Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh of HPE Security Fortify for reporting this issue to us.

## Crowd - LDAP Java Object Injection resulting in remote code execution - CVE-2016-6496

| Summary | CVE-2016-6496 - Crowd LDAP Java Object Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory Release Date | 19 Oct 2016 10 AM PDT (Pacific Time, -7 hours) |
| Product | Crowd |
| Affected Crowd Versions | * 1.4.1 <= version <  2.8.8 * 2.9.0 <= version <  2.9.5 |
| Fixed Crowd versions | * for 2.8.x, Crowd**2.8.8**has been released with a fix for this issue. * for 2.9.x, Crowd**2.9.5** has been released with a fix for this issue. * for 2.10.x, Crowd**2.10.1** has been released with a fix for this issue. |

**Summary of Vulnerability**

This advisory discloses a **critical severity** security vulnerability which was introduced in version 1.4.1 of Crowd.Versions of Crowdstarting with 1.4.1 before 2.8.8 (the fixed version for 2.8.x) and from 2.9.0 before 2.9.5 (the fixed version for 2.9.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

**Atlassian Cloud customers** are **not** affected by the issue described in this advisory.

**Customers who have downloaded and installed Crowd >= 1**.4.1** less than 2.8.8 (the fixed version for 2.8.x)**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed Crowd >= 2**.9.0 less than 2.9.5 (the fixed version for 2.9.x)****

Please **upgrade** your Crowd installations **immediately** to fix this vulnerability.

**JIRA Core, JIRA Software, JIRA Service Desk, Confluence, Bitbucket Server, FishEye and Crucible** installations which **do** **not** **use SSL/TLS connection** to configured LDAP server or allow users to manipulate specific attributes of an LDAP entry are affected by this issue. Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability in these products as **high. According to [Security Bug fix Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/security/secpol) fixes are included in the last maintenance releases.**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed JIRA >= 4**.3.0** less than 7.2.1 (the fixed version for 7.2.x)**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed Confluence >= 3**.5.0** less than 5.10.6 (the fixed version for 5.10.x)**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed Bitbucket Server >= 1**.3.0** less than 4.10.0 (the fixed version for 4.10.x)**

**Customers who have downloaded and installed FishEye and Crucible >= 4**.0.0** less than 4.2.0 (the fixed version for 4.2.x)**

We recommend to **upgrade** your installations to fix this vulnerability.

### **Crowd LDAP Java Object Injection (CVE-2016-6496)**

**Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

**Description**

The Crowd LDAP directory connector allowed an attacker to gain remote code execution in Crowd by injecting malicious attributes in LDAP entries. To exploit this issue, attackers either need to modify an entry in an LDAP directory that Crowd is configured to use or successfully execute a [Man-in-The-Middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) between an LDAP server and Crowd. Crowd installations configured to communicate with an LDAP server using the **LDAPS** protocol with the **Secure SSL**option enabled are immune to the [Man-in-The-Middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) vector only (unless an attacker is able to obtain the private key of the SSL/TLS certificate used to secure the communication).

All versions of **Crowd**from 1.4.1 before 2.8.8 (the fixed version for 2.8.x) and from 2.9.0 before 2.9.5 (the fixed version for 2.9.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:

**What You Need to Do**

**Upgrade (recommended)**

The vulnerabilities and fix versions are described in the description section above. Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest version.

**Upgrade Crowd to version 2**.10.1** or higher.**

If you are running**Crowd 2.9.x**and **cannot upgrade to Crowd 2.10.1** **then****upgrade to version 2.9.5.**

If you are running**Crowd 2.8.x**and **cannot upgrade to Crowd 2.9.5** **then****upgrade to version 2.8.8.**

For a full description of the latest version of Crowd, see [the release notes](/crowd/crowd-release-notes-199094.html). You can download the latest version of Crowd from the [download center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/download).

**Upgrade JIRA Core (this is also required if you are running JIRA Software or JIRA Service Desk) to version 7.2.1 or higher.**

For a full description of the latest version of JIRA Core, see [the release notes](/jiracore/jira-core-release-notes-781386726.html). You can download the latest version of JIRA from the [download center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/download).

**Upgrade Confluence to version 5.10.6 or higher.**

For a full description of the latest version of Confluence, see [the release notes](/doc/confluence-release-notes-327.html). You can download the latest version of Confluence from the [download center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download).

**Upgrade Bitbucket Server to version 4.10.0 or higher.**

For a full description of the latest version of Bitbucket Server, see [the release notes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/releases-776640503.html). You can download the latest version of Bitbucket Server from the [download center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download).

**Upgrade FishEye and Crucible to version 4.2.0 or higher.**

For a full description of the latest version of FishEye and Crucible, see [the release notes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/fisheye-releases-298976966.html). You can download the latest version of FishEye and Crucible from the [download center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/download).

**Mitigation**

The issue can be mitigated by restricting modifications of LDAP entries by LDAP users and configuring SSL/TLS connection between an LDAP Server and Crowd.

If you are running **Crowd 2.8.x** and **cannot upgrade** to 2.8.8 or 2.9.5 then you can follow these steps to mitigate the issue:

1. Configure the SSL/TLS connection between an LDAP server and Crowd. See [Configuring Crowd to Work with SSL](/crowd/configuring-crowd-to-work-with-ssl-151520306.html) for information on setting up secure transport.
2. Restrict modification of LDAP entries by LDAP users. The following restrictions should be implemented:
   * The users **should not be able to add additional object classes** to their LDAP entries ("javaContainer", "javaObject", "javaNamingReference", "javaSerializedObject", "javaMarshalledObject")
   * The users **should not be able to manipulate attributes** related to storing Java objects in an LDAP directory ("javaSerializedData", "javaClassName", "javaFactory", "javaCodeBase", "javaReferenceAddress", "javaClassNames", "javaRemoteLocation")
