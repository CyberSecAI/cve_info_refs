Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Crowd LDAP directory connector, which allows for the injection of malicious attributes within LDAP entries. Specifically, the connector was susceptible to Java object injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **LDAP Injection:** The core issue is an LDAP injection vulnerability. By manipulating specific LDAP attributes, an attacker can inject malicious Java objects.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The injected Java objects are then deserialized by the Crowd application, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Crowd server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **LDAP Entry Modification:** An attacker can directly modify an entry in the LDAP directory that Crowd is configured to use, inserting malicious attributes.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept and modify traffic between Crowd and the LDAP server, injecting malicious attributes during the communication process. However, this vector is mitigated when LDAPS is used with Secure SSL enabled, unless the attacker can obtain the private key for the SSL/TLS certificate used in the communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **LDAP Access:** The attacker needs either write access to the LDAP directory that Crowd is configured to use or the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack between the Crowd server and the LDAP server. This implies the attacker has some level of access or network position.
- **Knowledge of Target Attributes:** The attacker needs to know which LDAP attributes to modify in order to successfully inject the malicious Java objects.
- **Network Position (for MitM):** If performing a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker would need to be positioned on the network to intercept traffic between the Crowd server and LDAP server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "critical".
- The vulnerability affects versions of Crowd from 1.4.1 before 2.8.8 and from 2.9.0 before 2.9.5.
- Other Atlassian products like Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket Server, FishEye, and Crucible are also affected if they do not use SSL/TLS connections with their LDAP servers, with a "high" severity rating in those products.
- Mitigation includes upgrading Crowd to the fixed versions, restricting modifications to LDAP entries by LDAP users, and using LDAPS with the Secure SSL option enabled. Specific attribute restrictions are also listed in the mitigation section.
- The vulnerability was reported by Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh of HPE Security Fortify.
