Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-6611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of database and/or table names during the export process within phpMyAdmin. A specially crafted name can inject malicious SQL code into the queries executed by the export functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core issue is the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the names of databases or tables. This is due to insufficient sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input in the context of building SQL queries.
- **CWE-661:** This CWE (Incorrectly Calculated Sum or Checksum) is associated with situations where data integrity checks are either missing or insufficient. This seems to be a slightly incorrect mapping from the original issue of SQL Injection, although it's possible the SQL Injection is caused due to an incorrect data calculation/handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the MySQL server, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even full compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Database/Table Names:** The primary attack vector is through the creation of databases or tables with malicious SQL code embedded within their names.
- **Export Functionality:** The vulnerability is triggered when the export functionality of phpMyAdmin processes these specially crafted names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create and export databases or tables.
- **MySQL Access:** The attacker needs to have access to a MySQL database instance managed by a vulnerable phpMyAdmin installation.
