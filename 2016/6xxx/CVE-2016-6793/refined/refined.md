{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `DiskFileItem` class in Apache Wicket, when serialized by Kryo, allows an attacker to manipulate its serialized form. This can lead to an infinite loop if the client attempts to write to the `DeferredFileOutputStream` attribute. Additionally, if running on a Java VM before 1.3.1, the attacker can control the filename due to the missing NULL byte check.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of untrusted data",
      "Missing NULL byte check in filename handling",
      "Vulnerable `DiskFileItem` class implementation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (infinite loop). Ability to write, move, and delete files with the permissions of `DiskFileItem`. In older Java VMs, arbitrary code execution is possible through custom file placement and naming.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted serialized Java object",
      "Deserialization of untrusted data"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted serialized Java object, which will then be deserialized by the application.",
     "more_info": "The `DiskFileItem` class in Apache Wicket 6.x contains a vulnerability similar to that found in Apache Commons FileUpload. The Wicket version was not updated to address issues like CVE-2013-2186. The `DiskFileItem` class was removed in the 7.x branch due to the difficulty of tracking security updates in Commons FileUpload."
