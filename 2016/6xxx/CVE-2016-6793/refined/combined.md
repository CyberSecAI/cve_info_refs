CVE-2016-6793: Apache Wicket deserialization vulnerability

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache Wicket 6.x and 1.5.x

Description: Depending on the ISerializer set in the Wicket
application, it's possible that a Wicket's object deserialized from an
untrusted source and utilized by the application to causes the code to
enter in an infinite loop. Specifically, Wicket's DiskFileItem class,
serialized by Kryo, allows an attacker to hack its serialized form to
put a client on an infinite loop if the client attempts to write on
the DeferredFileOutputStream attribute.

Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache Wicket 6.25.0 or 1.5.17

Credit: This issue was discovered by Jacob Baines, Tenable Network
Security and Pedro Santos

# [R4] Apache Wicket DiskFileItem Java Deserialization Remote File Manipulation

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

[Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) is "an open source, component oriented, server-side, Java web application framework." Currently, main development of Wicket is done on the 8.x branch. However, Wicket’s website indicates the current release is listed as 7.3.0 and they [continue to offer 6.23.0 as well as 1.5.14](http://wicket.apache.org/start/download.html).

The Issue

Wicket 6.x contains an implementation of a [Java Class called “`DiskFileItem`”](https://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/wicket-6.x/wicket-util/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/util/upload/DiskFileItem.java) that is nearly identical to the Commons Upload previously disclosed in [TRA-2016-12](/security/research/tra-2016-12). The only real difference being that the Commons Upload version has been updated to address issues such as [CVE-2013-2186](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-2186/) where the Wicket version has not. Fortunately, most (if not all) JVM will catch this attack so it no longer needs to be explicitly checked for as done in Commons Fileupload. Interestingly, `DiskFileItem` was purged from the 7.x branch back in 2014 as a result of the [WICKET-5503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5503) ticket as seen in [commit 99fcd91](https://github.com/apache/wicket/commit/99fcd91fe8c3568750f65e7ed830c62b5d46cdaf). The developers correctly identified that tracking security updates in Commons FileUpload was too difficult (since they already missed the update to DiskFileItem).

Can This Be Used In Deserialization Attacks?

Of course! As a quick proof of concept, Tenable created a new payload in `ysoserial` and it is almost an exact copy/paste job of the [FileUpload1 payload](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/FileUpload1.java) but uses `wicket-util`. This allows an attacker to add, move, and delete files that Apache DiskFileItem can. Additionally, if an older Java VM is running, the attacker can control the filename as well, since the NULL byte check doesn't exist. In that case, the ability to name and place a custom file can lead to remote code execution.

Note that the CVSSv2 score downplays the severity of this issue due to the academic nature of the scoring system. Worst case scenario, this can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution in some cases through several actions.

---

On 2016-11-25, the Wicket team contacted us again and mentioned that they missed an important point in our original report to them: "*Protect against null byte attacks*". Pedro Santos from the Wicket team dug into this even further and committed additional fixes and write-up. His analysis concludes this is specific to Wicket and had CVE-2016-6793 assigned for it. More details will be published via Wicket's page on this issue in the near future.

### Solution

The Apache Wicket team has released versions 6.24.0 and 1.5.16 that resolve this issue.

### Disclosure Timeline

2016-05-05 - Issue Discovered
2016-05-23 - Issue reported to vendor at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
2016-05-24 - Vendor asks for PoC
2016-05-25 - Tenable sends PoC
2016-05-25 - Vendor says "not so familiar with the problem" asks for more information

2016-05-26 - Vendor doubts this is a vulnerability in Wicket
2016-05-26 - Tenable sends another write-up explaining they are technically correct, but like Commons, it can be tragic for developers. Implementing additional safeguards is trivial and does not impact the software.
2016-05-27 - Vendor agrees with our assessment.
2016-06-08 - Vendor makes changes in Git to address the issue. Fix will be included in 1.5.16 and 6.24.0.
2016-07-07 - Tenable confirms those changes should fix the issue.
2016-07-20 - Wicket releases 6.24.0 and 1.5.16 but doesn't inform Tenable.
2016-07-25 - Tenable realizes Wicket released a new version and confirmed the fixes.

# CVE-2016-6793 Apache Wicket deserialization vulnerability

31 Dec 2016

*Severity*: Low

*Vendor*: The Apache Software Foundation

*Versions Affected*: Apache Wicket 6.x and 1.5.x

*Description*: Depending on the ISerializer set in the Wicket application,
itâs possible that a Wicketâs object deserialized from an untrusted source
and utilized by the application to causes the code to enter in an infinite
loop. Specifically, Wicketâs DiskFileItem class, serialized by Kryo, allows
an attacker to hack its serialized form to put a client on an infinite loop
if the client attempts to write on the DeferredFileOutputStream attribute.

*Mitigation*: Upgrade to Apache Wicket 6.25.0 or 1.5.17

*Credit*: This issue was discovered
by Jacob Baines, Tenable Network Security and Pedro Santos
