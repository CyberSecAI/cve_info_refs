{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Lack of input validation on password length"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending very long passwords that would cause excessive CPU consumption in the sshd process.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can connect to an SSH server and send a very long password during authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to an SSH server where password authentication is enabled."
}
