- **Root cause:** Improper user data output validation in the web-based administration console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web console, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, information disclosure, or session hijacking.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the web-based administration console of Apache ActiveMQ. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious user-supplied data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious data that gets rendered by the web console.
