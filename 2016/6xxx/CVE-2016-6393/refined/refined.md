Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-6393 from the provided documents:

**1.  Verification of Relevance:**

*   The content from `tools.cisco.com` and `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com` directly references `CVE-2016-6393` and provides detailed information about it.
*   The content from `ics-cert.us-cert.gov` mentions `CVE-2016-6393` as one of several vulnerabilities affecting Rockwell Automation's Allen-Bradley Stratix industrial switches, referencing the original Cisco advisory.
*   Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to `CVE-2016-6393`.

**2.  Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** An error log message generated when an SSH connection to a device fails AAA authentication. Specifically, if a `Failed-Login Banner` is configured, the generation of this log message can be exploited.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Information Exposure:** The error log message reveals information that an attacker could potentially leverage.
    *   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a device reload by repeatedly failing the authentication. This is a case of uncontrolled resource consumption.
    *   **CWE-399:**  Resource Management Errors
    *   **CWE-209:** Information Exposure Through an Error Message
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Device Reloads:** A successful attack causes the vulnerable device to reload resulting in loss of service.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The repeated reloads lead to a denial-of-service condition, rendering the device unavailable.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attack is initiated by a remote user attempting to connect to a vulnerable device via SSH.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device in order to send the crafted SSH requests.
    *   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to attempt to authenticate which triggers the error message and related vulnerability.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco IOS and IOS XE software are affected if a AAA `Failed-Login Banner` is configured and SSH is used for remote connection. The advisory lists many specific IOS and IOS XE versions vulnerable. Rockwell Automation's Stratix switches are also impacted.
*   **Workaround:** Removing the AAA `Failed-Login Banner` with the command `no aaa authentication fail-message` mitigates the vulnerability.
*   **Indicators of Compromise:** The error log message `%Log packet overrun, PC 0x1A98468, format: ...` may be observed in the system log.
*   **CVSS Score:** The advisory lists a CVSS v2 base score of 7.1 and a temporal score of 6.2
*   **Exploitability:**  Exploitability is rated as "High" due to the easy trigger of the vulnerability.
*    **Official Fix (OF):** The advisory states that a complete vendor solution is available, either an official patch or an upgrade.

**4.  Summary**

CVE-2016-6393 is a denial of service vulnerability caused by improper logging of failed login attempts on Cisco IOS/IOS XE devices with AAA `Failed-Login Banner` configured and reachable via SSH. It can be triggered by unauthenticated remote attackers repeatedly failing SSH login attempts. The fix involves removing the `Failed-Login Banner`.
