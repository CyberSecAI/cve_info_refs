Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation of file paths within the web application's report generation functionality. Specifically, the `view.cgi` script does not properly sanitize the `files` parameter, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths, leading to the disclosure of local files.
- **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** This vulnerability is classified under CWE-73, which describes situations where an attacker can control the path used to access a file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the local system that the web server user has access to. This includes configuration files, application code, and other potentially sensitive data. While the webserver doesn't run as root, it can still expose valuable information.
- While the content does not specify the risk, the CVSS score indicates a partial impact on confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/events/reports/view.cgi`.
- The `files` parameter is used to specify the file to access, where directory traversal sequences such as `../` are used.
- A null byte `%00` is appended to the file path to terminate it prematurely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cisco Firepower Management Center to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `/events/reports/view.cgi`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `files`.
- The following request demonstrates exploitation:
```
GET /events/reports/view.cgi?download=1&files=../../../etc/passwd%00 HTTP/1.1
Host: 1.3.3.7
```
- The web server responds with the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file in the response body as an attachment.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Matt Bergin (@thatguylevel) of KoreLogic, Inc.
- Cisco released a patch in version 6.1 to address this vulnerability.
- A Snort rule (41356) is available to detect exploitation attempts.
