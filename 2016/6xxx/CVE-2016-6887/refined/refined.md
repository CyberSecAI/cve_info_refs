Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6887:

**Root Cause:**

- The `pstm_exptmod()` function within MatrixSSL's bignum implementation produced incorrect results for certain input values during modular exponentiation calculations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Calculation:** The core vulnerability lies in the `pstm_exptmod()` function failing to produce the correct result for specific input combinations.
- **Input Restrictions:** The "fix" involved restricting input bit sizes (512, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, 4096), which masked the underlying bug, and also limited the ability to handle non-standard key sizes. The underlying issue was not addressed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **RSA Private Key Extraction:** A miscalculation in modular exponentiation, especially when combined with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) optimization used in RSA signature calculations, can lead to the exposure of the private key.
- **Incorrect results in calculations:** A wrong calculation result is produced.
- **Connection failures:** Connections to sites with unusual key sizes or Diffie Hellman moduli will no longer work.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Client RSA key exchange:**  A malicious client could craft specific inputs during RSA key exchange that would trigger the incorrect calculation in the vulnerable server.
- **Diffie-Hellman key exchange:** Attacker-controlled values during DH exchange can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to perform RSA key exchange or DH key exchange:** The attacker needs to interact with a server using a vulnerable version of MatrixSSL using RSA or DH key exchange to provide malicious input values to the `pstm_exptmod` function.

**Additional Details:**

- The blog post mentions that the MatrixSSL developers based their bignum code on libtommath. However, libtommath did not exhibit the same vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was initially discovered via fuzzing by comparing results against OpenSSL.
- The fix by MatrixSSL developers is considered inadequate, since the underlying bug is still present, it only restricts the input sizes to the vulnerable function.
- The vulnerability was observed in devices using MatrixSSL.
- This issue is related to similar vulnerabilities observed in other bignum libraries where assumptions about input values are broken when the values are attacker-controlled.
