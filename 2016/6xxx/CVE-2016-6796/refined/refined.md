Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2016-6796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the JSP Servlet. This indicates that the vulnerability stems from insufficient validation or sanitization of user-provided configuration parameters that influence the behavior of the JSP Servlet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SecurityManager Bypass**: The core vulnerability is the ability for a malicious web application to circumvent the intended restrictions imposed by the SecurityManager.
*   **JSP Servlet Configuration**: The flaw lies in how configuration parameters related to the JSP Servlet are handled, allowing manipulation to circumvent security controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SecurityManager Bypass**: Attackers can gain access to functionalities and resources that should be protected by the SecurityManager.
*   **Unauthorized Actions**: By bypassing the SecurityManager, attackers can perform actions that are otherwise restricted, potentially leading to a wide range of malicious consequences, as suggested by other CVEs included in the same advisories (e.g., arbitrary file read and system property disclosure).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Web Application**: The attacker must deploy a malicious web application onto the vulnerable server.
*   **Configuration Manipulation**: The attack involves manipulating configuration parameters related to the JSP Servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Deployment Access**: The attacker needs the capability to deploy a web application on the affected Tomcat server.
*   **Application-Level Access**: Once deployed, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing system-level privileges.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content indicates that this vulnerability affects multiple products, particularly JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and Red Hat JBoss Web Server.
*   Patches are available for multiple versions of Tomcat (6.0.47, 7.0.72, 8.5.5, and 8.0.37), which suggests a widespread issue.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Low" in the context of Red Hat, but the CVSS score is 7.5 (HIGH), highlighting a potential difference in perceived risk versus technical severity.
*  The attack requires a malicious web application, which implies it's not directly exploitable via network access.

In summary, CVE-2016-6796 allows a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager by manipulating configuration parameters for the JSP Servlet which could lead to security breaches by allowing an attacker access to resources that are normally restricted.
