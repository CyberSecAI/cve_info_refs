- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `valueAsString` parameter within the JSON payload of the `ucLogin_txtLoginId_ClientStat` POST request is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the back-end database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can modify the `ucLogin_txtLoginId_ClientStat` POST request and inject malicious SQL code into the `valueAsString` parameter within the JSON payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web server. No prior authentication is required.
