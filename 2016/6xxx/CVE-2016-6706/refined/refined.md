  "CVE-2016-6706": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Mediaserver could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This issue is rated as High because it could be used to gain local access to elevated capabilities, which are not normally accessible to a third-party application.",
    "Root cause": "The provided code change fixes a vulnerability in OMWNodeInstance related to sanity checking the portIndex. The vulnerability involves a missing check on the portIndex within the OMWNodeInstance, potentially leading to a local privilege escalation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation",
      "Improper access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation. A malicious application can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "Attack vector": "A local malicious application can exploit the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device."
