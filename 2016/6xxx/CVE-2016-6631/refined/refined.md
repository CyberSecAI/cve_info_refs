Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `generator_plugin.sh` script within phpMyAdmin when run as a CGI application. Under specific server configurations, an attacker can inject a query string that is then executed as a command-line argument by this shell script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The core vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server via the injected query string. This arises due to the script's improper handling of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run any command on the server hosting phpMyAdmin. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
*   **Query String Injection:** The attack involves injecting malicious commands within a specially crafted query string. This query string is then passed to the vulnerable `generator_plugin.sh` script.
*   **CGI Configuration:**  The vulnerability is specific to phpMyAdmin instances running as a CGI application, indicating that the server's configuration plays a crucial role in the exploit's success.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the phpMyAdmin instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication to the phpMyAdmin interface.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is considered "critical" by the phpMyAdmin team.
*   The fix involves either removing the `generator_plugin.sh` file or, at least, removing execute permissions for it.
*   The vulnerability is tracked under PMASA-2016-54 by the phpMyAdmin project and is assigned CWE-661.
*   Specific affected versions include phpMyAdmin versions in the 4.6.x series (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x series (prior to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x series (prior to 4.0.10.17).
*   Patches were released for all affected branches to mitigate this.
