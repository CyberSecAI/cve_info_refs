Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located in the `SampleIterator` class within the Mediaserver component of Android. Specifically, there is an issue related to how the `SampleIterator` handles errors during the `seekTo` operation, where it doesn't clear its members upon failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. The `SampleIterator` fails to properly clear its member variables when a `seekTo` operation fails. This could leak information about the state of the iterator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting this information disclosure vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability in Mediaserver. The specific attack vector would involve manipulating the `SampleIterator` in a way that would cause a `seekTo` operation to fail. This failure would leave the internal members of the iterator uncleared, leading to the information disclosure when the iterator is accessed later.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have a local malicious application installed on the device that is capable of interacting with the Mediaserver component and specifically the `SampleIterator`.
