- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an inadequate account lockout mechanism in IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager. This allows attackers to attempt numerous login attempts without the account being locked out.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of account lockout mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to brute-force account credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the targeted system.
