Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing required cryptographic step within the implementation of SAP HANA. Specifically, there's a failure to enforce authentication and encryption for tenant services when operating in "high isolation" mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing Cryptographic Step (CWE-325): The core issue is the absence of proper cryptographic measures (authentication and encryption) for tenant services in high-isolation mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially gain access to arbitrary business information stored within the SAP system.
-  The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized data disclosure and modification.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remotely exploitable.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the SAP HANA system.
- No specific privileges or user accounts are required. The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory identifies the affected component as "SAP HANA DB"
- The vulnerability is classified as medium risk.
- The fix involves implementing SAP Security Note 2233550.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sergio Abraham of Onapsis Research Labs.
