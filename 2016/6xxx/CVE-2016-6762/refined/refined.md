Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6762:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds access vulnerability in the `libziparchive` library. Specifically, the boundary check of an invalid End of Central Directory (EOCD) record can fail due to an integer overflow of a `uint32_t` variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow when calculating offsets, leading to an incorrect boundary check.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** Due to the flawed boundary check, the code can attempt to read data from memory locations outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:** A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, leading to a potential elevation of privilege.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires a malicious application running on the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the target device.
* The attacker needs to craft a zip file with a malformed EOCD.
*   The attacker does not need any additional permissions or elevated access prior to exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix was addressed by adding `liblog` in the makefile and correcting the boundary check to prevent the integer overflow.
* The vulnerability is present in Android versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1 and 7.0.
