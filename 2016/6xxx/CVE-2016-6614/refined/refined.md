Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6614:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the username replacement functionality (`%u`) in the `SaveDir` and `UploadDir` features of phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** When the username substitution is enabled, a specially crafted username containing the `/.` sequence of characters (e.g., `/../../`) can be used to bypass directory restrictions and traverse the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to files and directories outside the intended scope by manipulating the username used in the `SaveDir` or `UploadDir` paths, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially-crafted MySQL username.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Configuration:** The phpMyAdmin instance must be configured to use the `%u` username replacement in the `SaveDir` or `UploadDir` configuration (e.g., `$cfg['SaveDir'] = 'SaveDir\_%u';`).
*   **User Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a MySQL user with a name that includes path traversal sequences (e.g. `/../`).

**Additional details from provided content:**
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201701-32) lists this CVE along with many others as impacting phpMyAdmin versions before 4.6.5.1
*   Debian LTS also references this CVE in their DLA 1415-1 security update.
*   The phpMyAdmin security announcement (PMASA-2016-37) provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability, mitigation factors, affected versions and links to patches
