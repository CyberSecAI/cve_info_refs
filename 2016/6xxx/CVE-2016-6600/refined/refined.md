Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-6600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `FileUploadServlet` in WebNMS has a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability in the `fileName` parameter of the `FileUploadServlet`. This allows an attacker to bypass file upload restrictions and write files to arbitrary locations on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious JSP file to a location from where it can be executed on the server, an unauthenticated attacker can gain control of the server.
- The attacker needs to upload a text file to the `../jsp/` directory with a filename of either `Login.jsp` or `WebStartXXX.jsp` to achieve code execution without authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated HTTP POST request to the `/servlets/FileUploadServlet` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `fileName` parameter to perform a directory traversal, such as `../jsp/Login.jsp`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WebNMS server. No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by including `../` sequences in the filename parameter during file upload, allowing the attacker to traverse the directory structure and place the malicious JSP file in a location that can be accessed through the web server.
- The attacker must also ensure the file extension is `.jsp`.

The advisory also mentions the following constraints:
- Only text files can be uploaded. Binary files will be mangled.
- To achieve code execution without authentication, the files need to be uploaded to the `../jsp/` directory with names such as `Login.jsp` or `WebStartXXX.jsp` where `XXX` is any string of any length.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specifics about the vulnerable servlet, the vulnerable parameter, the directory traversal method, and the limitations on successful exploitation.
