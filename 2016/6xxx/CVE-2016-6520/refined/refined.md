Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `MagickCore/enhance.c` file within ImageMagick.
- It stems from how the software handles the lazy pixel cache morphology.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a buffer overflow, which occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory space.
- This is related to how pixel data is handled and processed during image enhancement operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is described as "unspecified" but can be assumed to be significant, as indicated by a CVSS score of 9.1 (Critical).
- Possible impacts include:
  - Arbitrary code execution: An attacker might be able to overwrite memory and execute malicious code.
  - Denial of Service (DoS): The overflow could cause the program to crash, disrupting service.
  - Data corruption: The attacker might be able to alter data in memory, leading to incorrect results or other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- The specific attack vector involves manipulating image data that triggers the flawed logic in `enhance.c` when processing pixel caches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted image to the ImageMagick software to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in ImageMagick version 7.0.2-7.
- The commit `76401e172ea3a55182be2b8e2aca4d07270f6da6` contains the fix for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in the `ContrastStretchImage` and `EqualizeImage` functions, specifically where memory is allocated for `histogram` and `equalize_map`.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-6520 is a critical buffer overflow vulnerability in ImageMagick. It is located in `MagickCore/enhance.c`, affecting image processing routines. An attacker could exploit it by providing a malicious image, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The fix involved adjusting the lazy pixel cache morphology to prevent writing beyond allocated buffer limits.
