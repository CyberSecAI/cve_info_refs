- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager allows web pages containing sensitive information to be cached by a browser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information is stored unsafely in the browser cache on the user's hard drive for an indefinite amount of time. This makes the data vulnerable to access by unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with local access or malware installed on the user's computer can access the sensitive data stored in the browser cache. This could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access or malware on the user's machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the user's machine or the ability to install malware on the user's machine.
