The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Trend Micro Smart Protection Server (TMSPS), and CVE-2016-6266 is specifically related to authenticated remote code execution via unsanitized input to the `$LWCSCTRLEXEC` command.

Here's a breakdown of the CVE-2016-6266 related information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input before using them as parameters in system commands within PHP scripts. Specifically, the `$LWCSCTRLEXEC` command is executed with unsanitized POST parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The scripts directly use POST parameters (`host`, `apikey`, `enable`) within `exec()` calls without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the `webserv` user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST requests:** Attackers can send crafted POST requests to vulnerable PHP scripts such as `ccca_ajaxhandler.php` by manipulating parameters like `host`, `apikey`, and `enable`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the web administration panel of TMSPS.

**Vulnerable Code Examples:**

The following code excerpts from `/var/www/AdminUI/php/ccca_ajaxhandler.php` illustrate the vulnerability:

```php
case 'register':
  $host = "";
  $apikey = "";
  if( isset($_POST['host']))
  {
    $host = $_POST['host'];
  }
  //...
  if( isset($_POST['apikey']))
  {
    $apikey = $_POST['apikey'];
  }
  //...
  exec("$LWCSCTRLEXEC -c CCCA_REGISTER -u $host -a $apikey", $data, $ret);
```
```php
case 'save_setting':
  $ccca_enable = 0;
  if( isset($_POST['enable']))
  {
    $ccca_enable = $_POST['enable'];
  }
    //...
  exec("$LWCSCTRLEXEC -c CCCA_SAVESETTING -e $ccca_enable", $data, $ret);
```
```php
case 'test_connection':
  $host = "";
  $apikey = "";
  if( isset($_POST['host']))
  {
    $host = $_POST['host'];
  }
    //...
  if( isset($_POST['apikey']))
  {
    $apikey = $_POST['apikey'];
  }
    //...
  exec("$LWCSCTRLEXEC -c CCCA_TESTCONNECTION -u $host -a $apikey", $data, $ret);
```
The code snippets show how the `host`, `apikey`, and `enable` POST parameters are directly used in the `exec()` function, leading to command injection.
