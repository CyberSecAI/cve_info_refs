Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an "unquoted Windows search path vulnerability" present in the Apache OpenOffice installer for Windows.
*   This means that the installer's executable path wasn't properly quoted, allowing Windows to search for and execute programs within directories of the full path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unquoted Search Path:** The primary weakness is the lack of quotes around the full path to executables during the installation process. This allows Windows to potentially execute other programs in parent directories of the install location with same file name as the intended executable, leading to a potential privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privileged Trojan Execution:** A pre-existing Trojan horse application or malicious actor with admin rights can exploit this vulnerability. The malicious actor can place a malicious executable with the same name as one of the installer executables at a location in the search path (e.g. C:\Program.exe), leading to its execution during the installation of OpenOffice, effectively enabling privileged execution of malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Trojan Horse Infection:** The primary attack vector involves a system being already infected with a Trojan horse application or a malicious actor operating with admin rights.
*   **Installer Trigger:** The vulnerable OpenOffice installer acts as a delayed trigger for the exploit. The malicious program needs to place the malicious executable before the OpenOffice installer starts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to have already compromised the system with admin access or, more commonly, use a Trojan horse program operating with administrative privileges to place a malicious executable in the search path.
*   **Ability to place files:** The attacker needs to be able to place an executable in the search path to be executed by the vulnerable installer.
*  **Targeted system**: The attacker must target Windows systems because of the usage of windows search path.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text indicates that the vulnerability is considered "Medium" severity.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3.
*   The vulnerability affects all Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older, as well as older OpenOffice.org versions.
*   A proof-of-concept of the vulnerability exists.
*   A workaround is to use a custom install location without spaces in the full-path name.
