For general information about Apache OpenOffice security, please see our
[Frequently Asked Questions page](/security/faq.html).

For details of our security alerts by email service, please see our
[Security Alerts page](alerts.html).

OpenOffice is a complex piece of software developed by various teams. As such, it can contain security
relevant bugs. If you are a software developer and you believe you have found a vulnerability in our
source code, please contact our security team so
we can evaluate the problem and work on proper solution for our users and for future versions of our
product.

We appreciate early confidential disclosure to give vendors of products and solutions based on
OpenOffice time to react. We will coordinate the disclosure of your report with you.

In your report, please include the following informations.

* In which version of OpenOffice did you identify the problem?
* Do you have an official version of OpenOffice or e.g. a build from your GNU/Linux distribution
  (include the URL of the build if possible)?
* What is the impact of the problem (data loss, denial of service, executing commands, etc.)?
* How can the problem be reproduced?
* Is there an existing exploit?
* Has the problem already been published?

After we receive your report, we will work on the evaluation and we will reply to you (typically in the
next business days).

Vulnerabilities which have been resolved are listed in our [Bulletin](bulletin.html).

[CVE-2016-6803](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-6803)

[Apache OpenOffice Advisory](https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2016-6803.html)

**Windows Installer Can Enable Privileged Trojan Execution**

**Version 1.0**

Announced October 11, 2016

**Description**

The Apache OpenOffice installer for Winodws contained a defective
operation that could trigger execution of unwanted software
installed by a Trojan Horse application. The installer defect
is known as an "unquoted Windows search path vulnerability."

In the case of Apache OpenOffice installers for Windows, the PC
must have previously been infected by a Trojan Horse application
(or user) running with administrative privilege. Any installer
with the unquoted search path vulnerability becomes a delayed
trigger for the exploit. The exploit may already have operated
on the user's PC.

**Severity: Medium**

There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.

A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.

**Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation**

**Versions Affected**

All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.

OpenOffice.org versions are also affected.

**Mitigation**

Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and
cumulative security fixes. Use the Apache OpenOffice
[download page](https://www.openoffice.org/download/).

If instead of a typical installation you use a custom-installation
option to change the location where Apache OpenOffice is installed,
use a location that has no spaces in its full-path name.

**Defenses and Work-Arounds**

If you are unable to update to 4.1.3, there are other precautions
that can be taken. These precausions are also recommended as protection against other software that may have the vulnerability.

Ensure that there are no programs installed at the top-level folder
(usually C:\) where Windows is installed. All are dangerous,
especially ones named "Program", whether "Program.exe" or some
other variation.

If such programs are found, install or update to current
anti-virus/-malware software. Perform a complete system scan.
The scan may provide for removal of programs where there should
not be any. If that does not happen, it is necessary to remove
any Program.exe and others manually using administrator privilege.

**Further Information**

For additional information and assistance, consult the
[Apache OpenOffice
Community Forums](https://forum.openoffice.org/), or make requests to the
users@openoffice.apache.org
public mailing list. Defects not involving suspected security
vulnerabilities can be reported with a normal issue via
[Bugzilla](https://www.openoffice.org/qa/issue_handling/pre_submission.html).

The latest information on Apache OpenOffice security bulletins can
be found at the
[Bulletin Archive page](https://www.openoffice.org/security/bulletin.html).
