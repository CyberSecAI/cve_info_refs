- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Operations Center is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute malicious and unauthorized actions by transmitting requests from a user that the website trusts. This could lead to unauthorized changes or other actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed over the network. It requires user interaction (UI) to be successful.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into making a request to the application, while logged in. The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to the application.
