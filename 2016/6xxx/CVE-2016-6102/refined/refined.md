Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager storing sensitive information within URL parameters.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of sensitive data directly in the URL. This exposes the information when URLs are stored in locations like server logs, referrer headers or browser history.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to information disclosure. Unauthorized parties with access to the URLs via logs, referrer headers, or browser history can gain access to sensitive information.

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to URLs containing sensitive data. This may occur by accessing server logs, referrer headers or browser history.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to gain access to the location where the vulnerable URLs are stored (such as server logs, referrer headers, or browser history). No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific versions of IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager affected include: v2.5 - 2.5.0.7 and v2.6 - 2.6.0.2.
*   The provided CVSS vector is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), which indicates a vulnerability with low confidentiality impact requiring high attack complexity with no privileges required from the attacker.
*   The recommended fix is to upgrade to the versions specified.
