Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow in the `link_ntoa()` function within the BSD libc library.
- The `link_ntoa()` function generates an ASCII representation of a link-level address.
- The vulnerability occurs because of improper bounds checking of the `obuf` variable within the `link_ntoa()` function in `linkaddr.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper bounds checking when copying data into the `obuf` buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While the direct impact is unclear due to the specific usage of `link_ntoa()`, the potential exists for an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The provided CERT advisory indicates that this is a worst-case scenario.
- **Memory Corruption:** Overwriting memory can lead to unpredictable behavior, including program crashes and denial of service. The overflow can rewrite following static buffers that belong to other library functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted argument passed to the `link_ntoa()` function could trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to call the vulnerable `link_ntoa()` function with a maliciously crafted input.
- According to analysis by FreeBSD developers, it is very unlikely that applications exist that utilize `link_ntoa()` in an exploitable manner and the CERT/CC is not aware of any proof of concept.

**Additional details from the FreeBSD advisory:**
- The advisory clarifies that the overflow is to a static buffer and could overwrite other static buffers belonging to other library functions.
- The FreeBSD advisory states the impact is limited, citing the limited use of the function in existing applications and the limited length of the overflow.
- Exploitation of the vulnerability does not seem feasible, and no base system utilities or daemons are known to be vulnerable.
- There was a revision of the patch to address regressions.

**Affected Systems:**
- FreeBSD (multiple versions)
- HardenedBSD
- NetBSD
- Potentially other BSD-based systems (Apple, OpenBSD, PC-BSD, etc. are listed as affected or unknown).

**Mitigation:**
- FreeBSD and other vendors have released patches to address the issue. The advisory recommends updating to the latest versions of the operating systems or applying patches.
