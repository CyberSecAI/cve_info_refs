Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a null pointer dereference within the Samsung Exynos fimg2d driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A null pointer dereference occurs when the code attempts to access an object via a pointer that is null.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, a null pointer dereference usually results in a crash or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is not specifically described, but it involves triggering the vulnerable code path in the fimg2d driver where the null pointer is dereferenced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to interact with the affected fimg2d driver to trigger the null pointer dereference. This likely involves having the ability to execute code within the Android system. The vulnerability is located in a graphics driver, so this interaction may involve graphics processing calls.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects devices with Exynos7420 chipsets running Android versions L(5.0/5.1) and M(6.0).
- The fix involves verifying if the object is null before dereferencing it.
- The vulnerability was reported on June 7, 2016, and was privately disclosed.
- The vulnerability was assigned the identifier SVE-2016-6382 by Samsung.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity by Samsung.
