- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which allows an attacker to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. This would allow the attacker to make unauthorized requests to the vulnerable application while the user is logged in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user who is already authenticated with the vulnerable application into making a request that they did not intend to make. This generally involves sending a crafted link to the user, or injecting malicious code into a trusted website.
