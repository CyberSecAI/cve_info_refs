Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `iox` command within Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software. This command is susceptible to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the IOx Linux guest operating system (GOS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The `iox` command fails to properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the IOx Linux GOS with the privileges of the user that the command executes as. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected device. This includes the potential for complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability as the attacker gains code execution on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device to be able to execute the vulnerable command.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8 and a temporal score of 6.5.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds available.
- The fix for this vulnerability is available through a software update which is accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool.
