Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6305:

**Content Analysis:**

The provided text contains multiple sources describing vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. Specifically, CVE-2016-6305 is detailed in several sources, offering a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

**CVE-2016-6305:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:  The vulnerability is caused by the `ssl3_read_bytes` function in `record/rec_layer_s3.c`. This function doesn't properly handle a zero-length record within an `SSL_peek` call, leading to an infinite loop.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability manifests as an infinite loop within the `ssl3_read_bytes` function when an empty record is received during an `SSL_peek` operation. This causes a denial-of-service.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**: The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. A malicious peer sending an empty record can cause the affected OpenSSL process to become unresponsive and peg the CPU.

*   **Attack Vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending an empty record during an `SSL_peek` operation on a TLS connection.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker only needs to be able to establish a TLS connection with an affected server. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed, and the attack can be done remotely.

**Technical Details and Descriptions**

- The core of the vulnerability lies in how OpenSSL 1.1.0 handles empty records when `SSL_peek()` is called.
- The vulnerable function `ssl3_read_bytes` gets stuck in a loop when processing a zero-length record during `SSL_peek()`.
- The issue is specific to OpenSSL version 1.1.0 and was fixed in version 1.1.0a.
- The vulnerability affects SSL/TLS connections and is exploitable during the handshake phase when `SSL_peek()` is used.
- Affected servers may experience a hang during a call to `SSL_peek()`, leading to a denial of service.
- Some reports specifically mention how switching to a different TLS method can work around the issue but don't fix it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Gentoo Security Advisory and the Tenable advisories provide evidence this is a denial-of-service vulnerability.
*   The OpenSSL advisory provides the most detailed technical description.
*   The Oracle CPU lists also confirm the vulnerability and that the fix has been applied to those applications as well.
*   The GitHub commit log references the fix `63658103d4441924f8dbfc517b99bb54758a98b9`, which resolves the loop.
*   The Tenable entry explicitly mentions the vulnerability is resolved by upgrading to version 1.1.0a, and lists the vulnerable function as `ssl3_read_bytes` in record/rec_layer_s3.c.

**Summary of Extracted Information**

* **Vulnerability:** Denial of service due to infinite loop
* **Root cause:** Improper handling of zero-length records in `ssl3_read_bytes` function when `SSL_peek()` is used.
* **Affected component:** OpenSSL library, specifically the `record/rec_layer_s3.c` file.
* **Affected versions:** OpenSSL 1.1.0 prior to 1.1.0a.
* **Exploitation:** Sending an empty record to an affected server can trigger the infinite loop.
* **Impact:** Denial of Service (CPU pegged, server hangs).
* **Attack vector:** Remote, no authentication needed.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2016-6305 describes a denial of service vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.1.0. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in processing zero-length records with `SSL_peek()` leading to a denial-of-service. This analysis is consistent across multiple sources.
