## U by BB&T iOS banking application fails to properly validate SSL certificates

#### Vulnerability Note VU#338624

Original Release Date: 2016-09-30 | Last Revised: 2016-10-10

---

### Overview

U by BB&T for iOS, version 1.5.4 and earlier, fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which may enable an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

### Description

| [**CWE-295**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)**: Improper Certificate Validation -** CVE-2016-6550  [U by BB&T](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/u-by-bb-t/id995112030?mt=8) is a banking application. On iOS devices, the app fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which means that an attacker in the position to perform MITM attacks may be able to obtain sensitive account information such as login credentials. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as the iOS device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS, which may lead to the exposure of sensitive account information, including login credentials. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update the app to the latest version**Version 1.5.5 appears to have addressed the issue. |
| --- |

| **Do not use affected versions of the application**The features and services provided by the application are likely accessible via the [BB&T banking web site](https://www.bbt.com/). By using a web browser to access those resources, you may avoid situations where SSL is not validated.**Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |
