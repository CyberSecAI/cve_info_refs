Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-6534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input validation in the web application component of Opmantek NMIS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute commands on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive information such as configuration files, potentially containing usernames and passwords.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In the case of NMIS version 4.3.6f, the command injection is exploitable without authentication in the default configuration. In NMIS version 8.5.10G, an authenticated user with specific permissions can exploit the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP requests to specific CGI scripts (`tools.pl` in NMIS 8.5.10G and `admin.pl` in NMIS 4.3.6f) with malicious parameters in the "node" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected server.
*   **Authentication (Potentially):**
    *   For NMIS version 8.5.10G, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the `tls_finger` permission.
    *   For NMIS version 4.3.6f, authentication is not required in the default configuration.

**Specifics:**

*   **NMIS 8.5.10G:** Command injection in `tools.pl` via `node` parameter when `act` is `tool_system_finger`. Requires authentication and `tls_finger` permission.
*   **NMIS 4.3.6f:** Command injection in `admin.pl` via `node` parameter when `admin` is `man`, `finger`, `ping`, `trace`, or `nslookup`. Exploitable without authentication by default.
