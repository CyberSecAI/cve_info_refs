Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6128:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of invalid color indexes within the `gdImageCropThreshold` function of the libgd library. Specifically, when an out-of-range color index is provided, the function attempts to access memory outside of the allocated color table, leading to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:**  The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `gdImageCropThreshold` function due to incorrect validation of color indexes.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The function does not sufficiently validate color indexes before using them as array indices for color access, leading to the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Integer Overflow:** There's mention of a related integer overflow error within `_gdContributionsAlloc()` which could also lead to out-of-bounds memory access (although this is a separate CVE, CVE-2016-6207).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service attack. By supplying a specially crafted GD file with invalid color indexes, an attacker can cause a crash in applications using the vulnerable libgd library. This crash occurs because the program attempts to access memory that doesn't exist.
*   **Potential Code Execution (Indirectly):** While the primary impact is a crash, some sources suggest the possibility, under very specific conditions, of the out-of-bounds reads being exploited for arbitrary code execution. However, this is not the primary attack vector and is considered a low security risk. Specifically, the flaw could cause out-of-bounds reads in `gdImageCropThreshold`, potentially resulting in cropping an image to an invalid size. While bounds checks in related functions prevent OOB data copy into the final image, an attacker may try to craft specific parameters for exploitation.
*   **Information Leakage:** A detailed report from php.net indicates that the vulnerability can potentially cause an information leak due to the out-of-bounds memory reads which could potentially leak parts of the processes memory.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is primarily over a network, where a remote attacker can submit a crafted GD file to a vulnerable application.
*   **File Upload:** An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious image file to a system running a vulnerable application which then attempts to process it.
*  **Unspecified vectors** Based on CVE description on mitre.org "via unspecified vectors", there might be other attack vectors

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to submit crafted GD files:** The attacker needs the ability to submit or provide a malicious GD file to an application using the vulnerable libgd.
*   **No special privileges:** Exploiting the vulnerability generally does not require any special privileges on the targeted system.
*   **Network access or ability to upload:**  The attacker would typically require either network access or the ability to upload malicious files to the targeted system.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was found to be present in libgd versions prior to 2.2.3.
*   The fix involves validating color indexes in `gdImageCropThreshold` to prevent out-of-bounds reads.
*   Patches for this issue have been included in PHP versions 5.6.25 and 7.0.10.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects applications using the libgd library, including PHP applications using functions that rely on `gdImageCropThreshold`, such as `imagecropauto`.
*   Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a low security impact, citing that the maximum impact is a crash.

The vulnerability arises because of a lack of proper bounds checking, when an attacker provides a specially crafted GD file with invalid color indices it would cause an out-of-bounds memory read in the `gdImageCropThreshold` function potentially leading to a crash.
