- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the web UI of IBM Maximo Asset Management, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could potentially allow an attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI of IBM Maximo Asset Management by injecting malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to inject JavaScript code into a vulnerable field within the application's web UI. This could be achieved if an attacker has a malicious payload that can be introduced into a form, or if a user enters such code and views it later, or through other vectors of delivering data to the web UI.
