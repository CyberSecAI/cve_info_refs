{
  "CVE-2016-6709": {
    "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability in Conscrypt could enable an attacker to gain access to sensitive information if a legacy encryption API is used by an application. This issue is rated as High because it could be used to access data without permission.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to the improper mapping of 2-key 3DES to regular DES in Conscrypt's legacy encryption APIs. This incorrect mapping results in incorrect encryption when using 2-key 3DES.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Incorrect cryptographic mapping"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting the incorrect encryption mapping in applications using Conscrypt's legacy encryption API.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Applications using legacy encryption API."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to target applications that use the vulnerable legacy encryption API in Conscrypt and be able to supply malicious input to trigger the flaw.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises from an incorrect mapping of 2-key 3DES to regular DES within the Conscrypt library. Specifically, the library was mapping 2-key 3DES to regular DES instead of handling it correctly. This resulted in incorrect encryption results when 2-key 3DES was used via legacy APIs. This is a high severity issue as it can be used to potentially access data without proper authorization."
