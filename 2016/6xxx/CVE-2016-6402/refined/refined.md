Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-6402

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Manager and UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to the underlying operating system with *root* user privileges through the CLI. This is a privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control over the affected system, as they would have *root* level access. This includes the ability to read, modify, or delete system data, install malicious software, and disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. This means the attacker must have some form of access to the system to use the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
