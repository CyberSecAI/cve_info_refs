  "response": {
    "match": true,
    "info": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the interaction between the kernel's `/dev/binder` and the usermode `Parcel.cpp`. When a binder object is passed as `BINDER_TYPE_BINDER` or `BINDER_TYPE_WEAK_BINDER`, a pointer to that object in the server process is leaked to the client process as the cookie value.",
      "vulnerabilities": "The core weakness is the exposure of heap addresses from privileged binder services to client processes. Specifically, the `cookie` field of the `flat_binder_object` structure, intended for internal use, is populated with an address in the server process, which gets passed to the client during a binder transaction. In 64-bit processes, the high dword of the `fp->binder` pointer is also leaked due to type truncation.",
      "impact": "This address leak can be leveraged to bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), which is a security mechanism designed to prevent exploitation. With leaked addresses, an attacker could have more reliable targets for further exploitation.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves an attacker initiating a binder transaction from a client process to a server process, causing a binder object to be passed as `BINDER_TYPE_BINDER` or `BINDER_TYPE_WEAK_BINDER`. The leaked address is then received by the client process as part of the transaction.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to interact with binder services, typically through a local app. The attacker needs to be able to trigger binder transactions that pass binder objects, and needs to be able to process the response to observe the leaked addresses. No elevated privileges are needed, just a regular app capability"
