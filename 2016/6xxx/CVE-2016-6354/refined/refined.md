  "CVE-2016-6354": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow in the yy_get_next_buffer function in Flex might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving num_to_read.",
    "root_cause": "An integer type change from 'int' to 'size_t' for the 'num_to_read' variable in the yy_get_next_buffer function. When a crafted input larger than the buffer size is provided, the buffer is not resized due to the comparison being with a size_t, leading to a heap buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted input that is larger than the default buffer size of 16k. This input would be processed by flex generated scanners.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Context-dependent attackers who can supply specially crafted input to applications using vulnerable flex-generated scanners."
