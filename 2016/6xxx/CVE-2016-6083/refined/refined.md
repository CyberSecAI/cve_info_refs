- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default configuration for the IBM Tivoli Monitoring SOAP interface allows unauthenticated users to access SOAP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication on the SOAP interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can access SOAP queries which may contain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks by sending SOAP requests to the vulnerable interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system. No authentication is needed.
