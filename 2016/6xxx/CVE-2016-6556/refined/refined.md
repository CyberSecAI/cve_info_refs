Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-6556:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient filtering of SNMP data before storage and display within the OpenNMS web application. Specifically, data from SNMP traps and agent responses related to `sysName` and `sysContact` is not properly sanitized.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. There are two instances:
    *   **XSS via SNMP Trap Alerts:** Malicious payloads injected through SNMP trap data.
    *  **XSS via SNMP Agent Data:** Malicious payloads injected through responses to SNMP GetRequest messages, specifically for the sysName (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5) and sysContact (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4) OIDs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the browser sessions of OpenNMS users.
    *   This code can perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the authenticated user, including stealing cookies or performing privileged operations within the web application.
    *   It allows for a range of attacks such as account hijacking, data manipulation, and further exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SNMP Traps:** Sending malicious SNMP traps to the OpenNMS server, where the payload is stored.
    *   **SNMP Agents:** Configuring a malicious SNMP agent to respond to specific OIDs with the XSS payload during node discovery scans.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send SNMP traps to the OpenNMS server or to be reachable during the node discovery process.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require prior authentication with the OpenNMS server.
    *   **Ability to craft SNMP packets/operate an SNMP agent:** Ability to create malicious SNMP packets or setting up an SNMP agent to inject XSS.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect OpenNMS versions 18.0.0 and 18.0.1.
*   Version 18.0.2-1 fixes these vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matthew Kienow and reported by Rapid7.
* The fix involved enhancing `WebSecurityUtils.sanitizeString()` to prevent XSS via `<img onerror>` vector and sanitizing event parameters in more places in the web UI. The fix was implemented using the OWASP Java Encoder to sanitize the output.
