- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Input validation vulnerability in multiple Huawei products. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the processing of malformed packets related to Multicast LDP FEC (Label Distribution Protocol Forwarding Equivalence Class) stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation of network packets, leading to a potential buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the affected device by sending crafted malformed packets.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, specifically by sending crafted LDP packets to vulnerable network devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to have access to the control plane of the affected Huawei network devices.
