Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-6181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is input validation vulnerabilities present in the camera driver of certain Huawei smartphones. Specifically, there are five distinct vulnerabilities related to how the camera driver handles input parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper input validation in the camera driver. This means the driver doesn't adequately check the parameters it receives, allowing for malicious input to cause issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** An attacker can send crafted parameters that trigger a crash of the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain higher privileges than they should have on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker tricking the user into installing a malicious application on their device.
- **Camera Driver Parameter Manipulation:** The malicious application then exploits the vulnerabilities by sending crafted parameters to the camera driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the victim's device.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the user installing the malicious application on their phone.
