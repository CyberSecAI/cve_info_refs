Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-6223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `libtiff/tif_read.c` file. Specifically, within the `TIFFReadRawStrip1()` and `TIFFReadRawTile1()` functions when dealing with memory-mapped files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Negative Indexing:** An attacker can specify a negative index into the file content buffer. This happens when `stripoffset` exceeds the maximum value of `tmsize_t`.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The negative index leads to reading data from outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Process Crash:** Accessing unmapped memory due to the out-of-bounds read can cause the process to crash.
*   **Information Leak:** Depending on how LibTIFF is used, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to leak sensitive information by reading arbitrary memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF File:** An attacker can craft a malicious TIFF image file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to be enticed into processing the specially crafted TIFF file using an application that uses the vulnerable LibTIFF library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a TIFF file with a `stripoffset` that causes the out-of-bounds read.
*   The attacker needs to get the victim to process the malicious file. This is often accomplished via social engineering, or serving a malicious image on a webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in libtiff version 4.0.7 and commit revision 1.49 in the CVS HEAD.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201701-16) includes this CVE as one of the vulnerabilities addressed by upgrading to libtiff 4.0.7.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3762-1) also lists this CVE as one of the vulnerabilities addressed by the provided updates.
