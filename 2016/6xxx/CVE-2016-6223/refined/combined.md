Subject: CVE request: Information leak in LibTIFF

Hello oss-security,

I would like to request a CVE number for an information leak in LibTIFF,
specifically in the file libtiff/tif_read.c.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a negative index into the
file-content buffer and copy data from that position until the end of the
buffer.

This will allow an attacker to crash the process by accessing unmapped
memory and (depending on how LibTIFF is used) might also allow an attacker
to leak sensitive information.

The issue is fixed in CVS HEAD with the commit:

revision 1.49
date: 2016-07-10 20:00:21 +0200;  author: erouault;  state: Exp;  lines: +6
-3;  commitid: YhOZoKv5OA9gNNdz;
* libtiff/tif_read.c: Fix out-of-bounds read on
memory-mapped files in TIFFReadRawStrip1() and TIFFReadRawTile1()
when stripoffset is beyond tmsize_t max value (reported by
Mathias Svensson)

Kinds regards,
Mathias Svensson

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libTIFF, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.7** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag
Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and
KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifier and bug reports referenced for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
image file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.7"

```

This document describes the changes made to the software between the
*previous* and *current* versions (see above). If you don't
find something listed here, then it was not done in this timeframe, or
it was not considered important enough to be mentioned. The following
information is located here:

* [Major Changes](#highlights)* [Changes in the software configuration](#configure)* [Changes in libtiff](#libtiff)* [Changes in the tools](#tools)* [Changes in the contrib area](#contrib)

---

**MAJOR CHANGES:**

* The libtiff tools bmp2tiff, gif2tiff, ras2tiff, sgi2tiff,
  sgisv, and ycbcr are completely removed from the distribution.
  These tools were written in the late 1980s and early 1990s for
  test and demonstration purposes. In some cases the tools were
  never updated to support updates to the file format, or the
  file formats are now rarely used. In all cases these tools
  increased the libtiff security and maintenance exposure beyond
  the value offered by the tool.

---

**CHANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:**

* None

---

**CHANGES IN LIBTIFF:**

* libtiff/tif\_dirread.c: in TIFFFetchNormalTag(), do not
  dereference NULL pointer when values of tags with
  TIFF\_SETGET\_C16\_ASCII / TIFF\_SETGET\_C32\_ASCII access are
  0-byte arrays. Fixes
  http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2593 (regression
  introduced by previous fix done on 2016-11-11 for
  CVE-2016-9297). Reported by Henri Salo. Assigned as
  CVE-2016-9448* libtiff/tif\_aux.c: fix crash in TIFFVGetFieldDefaulted() when
    requesting Predictor tag and that the zip/lzw codec is not
    configured. Fixes
    http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2591* libtiff/tif\_dirread.c: in TIFFFetchNormalTag(), make sure
      that values of tags with TIFF\_SETGET\_C16\_ASCII /
      TIFF\_SETGET\_C32\_ASCII access are null terminated, to avoid
      potential read outside buffer in \_TIFFPrintField(). Fixes
      http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2590* libtiff/tif\_dirread.c: reject images with OJPEG compression
        that have no TileOffsets/StripOffsets tag, when OJPEG
        compression is disabled. Prevent null pointer dereference in
        TIFFReadRawStrip1() and other functions that expect
        td\_stripbytecount to be non NULL. Fixes
        http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2585* libtiff/tif\_strip.c: make TIFFNumberOfStrips() return the
          td->td\_nstrips value when it is non-zero, instead of
          recomputing it. This is needed in TIFF\_STRIPCHOP mode where
          td\_nstrips is modified. Fixes a read outsize of array in
          tiffsplit (or other utilities using TIFFNumberOfStrips()).
          Fixes http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2587
          (CVE-2016-9273)* libtiff/tif\_predict.h, libtiff/tif\_predict.c: Replace
            assertions by runtime checks to avoid assertions in debug
            mode, or buffer overflows in release mode. Can happen when
            dealing with unusual tile size like YCbCr with
            subsampling. Reported as MSVR 35105 by Axel Souchet & Vishal
            Chauhan from the MSRC Vulnerabilities & Mitigations* libtiff/tif\_dir.c: discard values of SMinSampleValue and
              SMaxSampleValue when they have been read and the value of
              SamplesPerPixel is changed afterwards (like when reading a
              OJPEG compressed image with a missing SamplesPerPixel tag, and
              whose photometric is RGB or YCbCr, forcing SamplesPerPixel
              being 3). Otherwise when rewriting the directory (for example
              with tiffset, we will expect 3 values whereas the array had
              been allocated with just one), thus causing a out of bound
              read access. Fixes
              http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2500
              (CVE-2014-8127, duplicate: CVE-2016-3658)* libtiff/tif\_dirwrite.c: avoid null pointer dereference on
                td\_stripoffset when writing directory, if FIELD\_STRIPOFFSETS
                was artificially set for a hack case in OJPEG case. Fixes
                http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2500
                (CVE-2014-8127, duplicate: CVE-2016-3658)* libtiff/tif\_getimage.c (TIFFRGBAImageOK): Reject attempts to
                  read floating point images.* libtiff/tif\_predict.c (PredictorSetup): Enforce
                    bits-per-sample requirements of floating point predictor (3).
                    Fixes CVE-2016-3622 "Divide By Zero in the tiff2rgba tool."* libtiff/tif\_pixarlog.c: fix out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities
                      in heap allocated buffers. Reported as MSVR 35094. Discovered by
                      Axel Souchet and Vishal Chauhan from the MSRC Vulnerabilities &
                      Mitigations team.* libtiff/tif\_write.c: fix issue in error code path of
                        TIFFFlushData1() that didn't reset the tif\_rawcc and tif\_rawcp
                        members. I'm not completely sure if that could happen in
                        practice outside of the odd behaviour of t2p\_seekproc() of
                        tiff2pdf). The report points that a better fix could be to
                        check the return value of TIFFFlushData1() in places where it
                        isn't done currently, but it seems this patch is enough.
                        Reported as MSVR 35095. Discovered by Axel Souchet & Vishal
                        Chauhan & Suha Can from the MSRC Vulnerabilities & Mitigations
                        team.* libtiff/tif\_pixarlog.c: Fix write buffer overflow in
                          PixarLogEncode if more input samples are provided than
                          expected by PixarLogSetupEncode. Idea based on
                          libtiff-CVE-2016-3990.patch from
                          libtiff-4.0.3-25.el7\_2.src.rpm by Nikola Forro, but with
                          different and simpler check. (bugzilla #2544)* libtiff/tif\_read.c: Fix out-of-bounds read on memory-mapped
                            files in TIFFReadRawStrip1() and TIFFReadRawTile1() when
                            stripoffset is beyond tmsize\_t max value (reported by Mathias
                            Svensson)* libtiff/tif\_read.c: make TIFFReadEncodedStrip() and
                              TIFFReadEncodedTile() directly use user provided buffer when
                              no compression (and other conditions) to save a memcpy()* libtiff/tif\_write.c: make TIFFWriteEncodedStrip() and
                                TIFFWriteEncodedTile() directly use user provided buffer when
                                no compression to save a memcpy().* libtiff/tif\_luv.c: validate that for COMPRESSION\_SGILOG and
                                  PHOTOMETRIC\_LOGL, there is only one sample per pixel. Avoid
                                  potential invalid memory write on corrupted/unexpected images
                                  when using the TIFFRGBAImageBegin() interface (reported by
                                  Clay Wood)* libtiff/tif\_pixarlog.c: fix potential buffer write overrun in
                                    PixarLogDecode() on corrupted/unexpected images (reported by
                                    Mathias Svensson) (CVE-2016-5875)* libtiff/libtiff.def: Added \_TIFFMultiply32 and
                                      \_TIFFMultiply64 to libtiff.def* libtiff/tif\_config.vc.h (HAVE\_SNPRINTF): Add a '1' to the

		 CVE-2016-10094

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libtiff library
and the included tools tiff2rgba, rgb2ycbcr, tiffcp, tiffcrop, tiff2pdf
and tiffsplit, which may result in denial of service, memory disclosure
or the execution of arbitrary code.

There were additional vulnerabilities in the tools bmp2tiff, gif2tiff,
thumbnail and ras2tiff, but since these were addressed by the libtiff
developers by removing the tools altogether, no patches are available
and those tools were also removed from the tiff package in Debian
stable. The change had already been made in Debian stretch before and
no applications included in Debian are known to rely on these scripts.
If you use those tools in custom setups, consider using a different
conversion/thumbnailing tool.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.7-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
