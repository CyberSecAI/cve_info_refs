(CVE) ID: CVE-2016-6814
CVE Description: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

===CONTENT to ANALYZE===

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6814:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Apache Groovy library that allows for remote code execution through deserialization. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by a vulnerable application, executes code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization: The application relies on deserialization but does not properly sanitize incoming objects or isolate the code that handles deserialization. This opens the system to the possibility of malicious code injection.
- Use of vulnerable Apache Groovy Library: The application uses a vulnerable version of the Apache Groovy Library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or client.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The malicious object can be sent over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable system or application that uses the affected Groovy library, or they need to be able to exploit a system where deserialization of objects is not properly secured or isolated.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is noted in the contexts of:
    *   Oracle WebCenter Sites (as listed in Oracle's Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019)
    *   Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ (as listed in RHSA-2017:0868 - Security Advisory)
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 via RHSA-2017:2486
    *   Oracle Utilities Framework
    *   Oracle Insurance Calculation Engine
    *   Oracle Insurance Policy Administration J2EE
    *   Oracle Insurance Rules Palette
    *   Oracle Agile Engineering Data Management
    *   JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools
    *   Oracle Financial Services (Various products using jackson-databind library)
    *   Oracle Food and Beverage Applications
    *   Oracle Application Testing Suite
    *   Oracle E-Business Suite
    *   Primavera Gateway
    *   Oracle Retail Applications

*   The Red Hat Security Advisory mentions that the deserialization flaw allows for RCE by crafting a special serialized object that will execute code when deserialized.
*  Several vendors have applied fixes to many product families using the jackson-databind, Spring Framework and Bouncy Castle Java libraries, etc.. This is due to their usage by these products. The core issue is unsafe deserialization of objects.
*  The vulnerability was reported to Oracle by Abid Gul Shahid as CVE-2019-2809.

This vulnerability is widespread within many applications and is associated with use of libraries like Apache Groovy and jackson-databind, when deserialization of untrusted objects is handled insecurely.
