Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-6460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the FTP Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) of Cisco Firepower System Software. It allows an attacker to bypass FTP malware detection rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of FTP traffic by the REST API, specifically when malware block is configured for FTP connections.
- This allows a bypass of the configured malware detection rules for FTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass the FTP malware detection rules.
- This could allow the attacker to download malware over an FTP connection to a system that should otherwise have blocked the malware.
- The impact is rated as partial for integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- It requires low complexity (AC:L) and no authentication (Au:N).
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by using a specially crafted FTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Firepower system.
- No special authentication or access is required.
- The attacker needs to be capable of sending FTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 5.0 and temporal score of 4.1.
- A functional exploit is available (E:F), an official fix is available (RL:OF), and the vulnerability has been confirmed (RC:C).
- The vulnerability only affects Cisco Firepower System Software when the device has a file policy with **malware block** configured for FTP connections.
- There are no workarounds available.
