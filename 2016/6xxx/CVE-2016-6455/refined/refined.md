Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6455:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Slowpath of StarOS for Cisco ASR 5500 Series routers with Data Processing Card 2 (DPC2).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A vulnerability in the handling of subscriber sessions in the slow path.
- CWE-399: Resource Management Errors, specifically impacting availability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause a subset of subscriber sessions to be disconnected.
- This results in a partial denial of service (DoS) condition, affecting only some subscribers, not the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- No authentication is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not need any specific authentication credentials.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 5500 devices with Data Processing Card 2 (DPC2) running StarOS 18.0 or later.
-  The provided CVSS vector string `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C` translates to:
    -   **AV:N** (Access Vector: Network)
    -   **AC:L** (Access Complexity: Low)
    -   **Au:N** (Authentication: None)
    -   **C:N** (Confidentiality Impact: None)
    -   **I:N** (Integrity Impact: None)
    -   **A:P** (Availability Impact: Partial)
    -  **E:F** (Exploitability: Functional)
    -   **RL:OF** (Remediation Level: Official Fix)
    -   **RC:C** (Report Confidence: Confirmed)
- The base CVSS score is 5.0 and the temporal score is 4.1.
- A workaround exists involving changing the MTU configuration on internal interfaces, but this will not persist through a reboot and is not a complete solution.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- No public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability were known at the time of the advisory.
