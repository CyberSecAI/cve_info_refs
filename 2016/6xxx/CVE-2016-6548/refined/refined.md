{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Nut mobile app makes requests via HTTP instead of HTTPS, exposing the user's session token.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext communication (HTTP)",
      "Session token included in URL"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can capture the HTTP requests containing the session token and reuse it to gain full access to the user's account.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network sniffing"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to intercept the HTTP traffic between the mobile application and the server, typically by being on the same network (e.g. using a public Wi-Fi).  An attacker can then replay the captured request to gain account access."
