### Summary
A vulnerability in the traffic stream metrics (TSM) implemented with the Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP) of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because the process on the WLC unexpectedly restarts. The DoS condition could occur when a subsequent Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) request is received for TSM information.

### Affected Products
This vulnerability affects all 6.x through 8.x releases of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller prior to the first fixed release for those releases. The first fixed releases for those releases are 8.0.140, 8.2.121.0, and 8.3.102.0.

### Attack vector
An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

### Impact
Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the WLC process unexpectedly restarting.

### Root cause
The vulnerability lies in the traffic stream metrics (TSM) implementation within the Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP) of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). The unexpected restart of the WLC process is triggered when a subsequent Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) request is received for TSM information.

### Required attacker capabilities
The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected system.
