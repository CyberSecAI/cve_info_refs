Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the content filtering functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA).
*   The issue arises when the software is configured to use content filters for email attachments that are protected or encrypted. Specifically, a filter condition like `if (encrypted) OR (attachment-protected)` can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Content Filter Bypass:** The core weakness is that the content filter, designed to identify and act upon encrypted or protected attachments, fails to do so under certain circumstances, allowing those emails through.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassed Filters:**  Email that should have been filtered according to the configured rules is instead forwarded by the device.
*   **Potential Security Risks:** This bypass can lead to a range of security issues, depending on what the content filter was designed to block, such as malware, phishing attempts, or sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending specially crafted emails with encrypted or protected attachments.
*   **Email Transmission:** The attack is executed via email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable Cisco ESA.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (both virtual and hardware).
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.0 and a temporal score of 4.8.
*  **CWE:** CWE-200 (Information Exposure) is associated with this vulnerability. Although the impact is categorized as integrity (I:P) in the CVSS score, the associated CWE suggests information exposure. The bypass of the filter could allow malicious attachments to be delivered.
*   **No Known Public Exploits:** At the time of the advisory, there were no known public announcements or malicious uses of this vulnerability.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available, requiring a software patch to resolve the issue.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco provides fixed software through bug fixes, accessible via the Cisco Bug Search Tool.
