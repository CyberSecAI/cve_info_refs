Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-6473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to how Cisco IOS handles certain Layer 2 frames, leading to a network storm. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to Cisco bug IDs CSCuu69332 and CSCux07028.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of Layer 2 frames can lead to a Layer 2 network storm.
- Specific to Cisco IOS on Catalyst Switches and Nexus 9300 Series Switches.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an adjacent attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to a Layer 2 network storm, leading to disruption of network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent attacker (AV:A)
- Unauthenticated attacker (Au:N)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in an adjacent network to the vulnerable device (Layer 2 adjacency).
- The attacker does not need any authentication credentials.
- The attacker needs to send specific Layer 2 frames to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** Base 6.1, Temporal 5.0
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   For CSCux07028, upgrade to software version 7.0(3)l2(1) or later or disable LLDP on the attached device.
    *   For CSCuu69332, enabling `dot1x system-auth-control` in global config mode may mitigate the vulnerability depending on the flooded Layer 2 frame.
*   **Exploitability:** Functional exploit code is available (E:F).
*   **Report Confidence:** Confirmed (C), meaning the vulnerability has been acknowledged by Cisco.
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco IOS Software on Catalyst Switches and Nexus 9300 Series Switches.
*   **Discovery:** The issue was discovered when handling customer service requests and also reported to Cisco PSIRT by Denis Nolan and Nick Hilliard from INEX.
