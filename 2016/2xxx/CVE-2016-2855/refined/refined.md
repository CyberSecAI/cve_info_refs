Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a DLL side-loading vulnerability in the "Mobile Broadband HL Service" provided by Huawei. The service executable is located in `C:\ProgramData\MobileBrServ`. This directory has insecure file permissions, allowing any local user to create files and directories within it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `C:\ProgramData\MobileBrServ` folder allows write access to unprivileged users.
- **DLL Side-Loading:** The "Mobile Broadband HL Service" attempts to load `VERSION.dll` from its installation directory during startup.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The service does not validate the integrity or source of the `VERSION.dll`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can gain full SYSTEM privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious DLL in the vulnerable directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges when the service starts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File System:** The attacker must have local access to the machine's file system.
- **DLL Planting:** The attacker writes a malicious DLL named `VERSION.dll` to the `C:\ProgramData\MobileBrServ` directory.
- **Service Restart:** The malicious DLL is executed when the "Mobile Broadband HL Service" is started (typically during system boot).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target system with the ability to write files to the file system.
- **No elevated privileges required** to perform the attack.
- No special network access is required, this is a local attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
- The vulnerability was present in Huawei Mobile Broadband HL Service versions up to 22.001.25.00.03 (x86 and x64).
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit is provided in the analysis, including the C++ source code for a malicious `VERSION.dll` that adds a new administrative user.
- The suggested fix is to change the file system ACLs to prevent normal users from writing to the `C:\ProgramData\MobileBrServ` folder. A workaround is also suggested that can be automated using icacls.exe.
