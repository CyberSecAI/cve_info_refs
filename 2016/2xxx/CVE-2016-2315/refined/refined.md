Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-2315:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `path_name()` function in Git used an `int` to store the calculated length of a pathname. This could result in an integer overflow if the path components were too long, wrapping the value to a smaller one.
*   The subsequent allocation based on the truncated size leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   The `strcpy` and `memcpy` operations into the undersized buffer caused memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Truncation:** The use of `int` instead of `size_t` allowed for truncation or wrapping of size/length values, leading to a smaller-than-required buffer.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Writing past the allocated memory area due to integer overflows in the path size calculations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The primary concern is the potential for arbitrary code execution on both client and server systems. This could be achieved if the buffer overflow is exploited to write to return addresses on the stack.
*   **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption can cause a crash or denial of service, especially in cases where the overflows do not allow the attacker to gain code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cloning/Pushing Repositories:** Attackers could create malicious Git repositories with a large number of nested trees or overly long filenames to trigger this vulnerability when a user clones or pulls a repo containing this flaw.
*   **Specially Crafted Packfiles:** A carefully crafted packfile containing oversized path information can cause the vulnerability during server/client operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **For client-side exploitation:** The attacker needs to trick a user into cloning or fetching from a malicious repository or supply a crafted packfile to an application that uses git.
*   **For server-side exploitation:** The attacker would need the ability to push changes to the git server, which often requires authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all git versions before 2.7.1 with the most severe case occuring in versions before commit 34fa79a6 because they use strcpy(), making memory overflows easier to achieve.
*   The issue was fixed by removing path_name() and using memcpy(), and by properly using size_t variables and adding overflow checks.
*   Red Hat, Debian, SUSE and openSUSE were among the distributions that issued patches to fix this issue.
*   The vulnerability is related to how Git processes pathnames, and was identified as having two potential attack vectors.

**CVSS Scores:**

*   CVSS v2 scores range from 6.8 to 10.0
*   CVSS v3 scores include 9.8

The vulnerability was assigned both CVE-2016-2315 (integer truncation) and CVE-2016-2324 (integer overflow).
