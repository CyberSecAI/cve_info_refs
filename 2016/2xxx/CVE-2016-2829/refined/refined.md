  "CVE-2016-2829": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 47.0 allows remote attackers to spoof permission notifications via a crafted web site that rapidly triggers permission requests, as demonstrated by the microphone permission or the geolocation permission.",
    "extracted_data": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition in handling multiple permission requests in quick succession, specifically affecting the display of icons in the permission notification dialogs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition",
        "Incorrect icon display",
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can trick a user into granting permission to the wrong resource by displaying an incorrect icon on the permission prompt. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources such as the microphone or geolocation.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
        "Crafted web site"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a website that rapidly triggers multiple permission requests, and trick the user into accessing this website.",
      "more_info": "The issue was specifically with the microphone icon, which has specific code that selects the icon to show in the panel when the popup is shown. The problem stemmed from using '.firstChild' when the wrong icon was selected. The fix replaced this with getElementById, and the issue could be reproduced deterministically by requesting three permission requests in quick succession."
