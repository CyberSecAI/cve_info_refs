  "CVE-2016-2041": {
    "Description": "libraries/common.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.13, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.3, and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.",
    "Root cause": "The application uses a non-constant time algorithm to compare CSRF tokens.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability due to non-constant time comparison of CSRF tokens."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can bypass CSRF protection by measuring the time taken for comparisons, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send requests and measure timing differences.",
     "Patches": [
        "The following commits have been made on the 4.0 branch to fix this issue: fe62b69a5b032de8e1d9d0a04456c1cecf46428c",
