Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to some passwords being stored in clear text within the configuration files of IBM QRadar SIEM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of passwords in plain, unencrypted text within configuration files. This makes them easily accessible if the files are compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker who gains access to the configuration files containing clear text passwords can use them to gain unauthorized access to the affected systems or applications.
*   **Compromise of IBM QRadar SIEM:** Since IBM QRadar SIEM is a security information and event management system, a compromise could have significant impact, potentially allowing attackers to disable or subvert security measures, gain access to sensitive logs, or manipulate security events.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs access to the file system where the configuration files are stored. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Compromise of the system running QRadar SIEM.
    *   Gaining access via other vulnerabilities
    *   Exploiting misconfigurations within the environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to access the file system where the configuration files with clear text passwords are stored. This could involve either internal access to the network or through an external attacker that has gained access to the system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM QRadar versions 7.2.n and 7.1.n.
*   IBM released fixes for this issue in QRadar 7.2.7 and IBM QRadar SIEM 7.1 MR2 Patch 13.
*   There are no workarounds, so applying the patches is critical.
*   IBM's X-Force Ethical Hacking Team discovered the vulnerability.
