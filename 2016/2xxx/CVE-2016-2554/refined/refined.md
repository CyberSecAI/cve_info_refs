  "CVE-2016-2554": {
    "description": "A stack overflow vulnerability was reported that may occur when decompressing tar archives due to phar_tar_writeheaders() potentially copying non-terminated linknames from entries parsed by phar_parse_tarfile().",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from `phar_tar_writeheaders()` using `strncpy` with a length derived from `strlen` on a linkname that is not guaranteed to be null-terminated, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the linkname is larger than the destination buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Copying non-null terminated string using strlen"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack results in a crash of the PHP interpreter. While not explicitly stated in the CVE description, it is implied that a stack-based buffer overflow can also result in arbitrary code execution, if the attacker has sufficient control over the overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting a crafted TAR archive within a Phar file.",
      "Processing of malicious Phar file via PHP interpreter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious Phar archive to a vulnerable PHP application, or control a Phar file that a vulnerable PHP application processes.",
     "affected_versions": [
        "PHP before 5.5.32",
        "PHP 5.6.x before 5.6.18",
        "PHP 7.x before 7.0.3"
    ],
    "mitigations": [
      "Mitigated by the use of FORTIFY_SOURCE in PHP packages included in Red Hat products, which terminates program execution before the overflow occurs.",
      "Disabling the Phar extension via php.ini (`extension=phar.so`)."
    ],
   "extra_details": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow, not a stack overflow as indicated by the upstream bug summary.  The `linkname` field in a tar header is not guaranteed to be null terminated and it is copied using `estrdup` in `phar_parse_tarfile()` and then later written to a fixed size buffer in `phar_tar_writeheaders()` using `strncpy` based on `strlen()`.  FORTIFY\_SOURCE mitigates the issue by detecting the overflow and terminating program execution before the overflow happens, limiting impact to a crash of the PHP interpreter. Phar files are distribution format for PHP applications, and their content is typically executed on the server. A malicious Phar archive can therefore execute code on the system without exploiting any parsing issues."
