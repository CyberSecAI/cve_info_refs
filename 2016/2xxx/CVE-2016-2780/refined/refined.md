- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper DLL loading by Huawei UTPS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL hijacking vulnerability. UTPS loads DLL files without proper validation, allowing an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can load a malicious DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution. If the malicious DLL creates a shell, it allows for system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have physical access to a device using the vulnerable Huawei UTPS software. The attacker then needs to replace a legitimate DLL with a malicious one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires physical access to a device running the vulnerable UTPS software and the ability to replace a system DLL.
