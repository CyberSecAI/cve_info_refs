# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client could expose sensitive information (CVE-2016-2861, CVE-2016-0400)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client could expose sensitive information.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2861](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2861) IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale uses weaker than expected security to encrypt data which could allow an attacker that is able to capture network traffic to decrypt sensitive information. This vulnerability only applies to the WebSphere eXtreme Scale client, and only when WebSphere eXtreme Scale is used as the provider for the WebSphere Dynamic Cache.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112657> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0400](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0400) **DESCRIPTION:** IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input when processing malicious requests. This vulnerability only applies to the WebSphere eXtreme Scale client, and only when WebSphere eXtreme Scale is used as the HTTP Session Cache provider. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers containing unicode characters and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 6.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112655>for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions
