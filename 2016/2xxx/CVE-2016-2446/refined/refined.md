Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-2446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the NVIDIA media driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This is due to a flaw in the NVIDIA media driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the kernel.
- Could result in a local privilege escalation.
- May lead to a permanent device compromise, requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local malicious application running on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the affected device.
- The attacker needs to exploit a service with high privilege in order to call the NVIDIA driver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity. Normally a kernel code execution bug like this would be rated Critical, but it is rated High because it first requires compromising a high privilege service to call the driver.
- The patch for this issue is not in AOSP and is contained in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the Google Developer site.
- Affected devices include the Nexus 9.
