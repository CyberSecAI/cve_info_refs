Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-2798:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided content, including bug reports and security advisories, explicitly mentions "CVE-2016-2798" as the alias or reference to the described vulnerability related to Graphite2.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

  - The vulnerability is a **heap-based buffer over-read** located in the `graphite2::GlyphCache::Loader::Loader` function within the Graphite 2 library. Specifically, it occurs during the loading process of a crafted Graphite smart font. This implies that when a malicious or malformed font is processed, the code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer, causing a crash or other impacts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Heap-based buffer over-read:** This means that the program tries to read data from a memory location beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer in the heap. This is caused by the lack of proper validation of the data when loading and processing font files.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate and likely impact is a denial of service. A carefully crafted font file can cause the application using Graphite 2 to crash.
    - **Unspecified Other Impact:** The vulnerability description also mentions "possibly have unspecified other impact", which suggests there could be potential for other, potentially more serious issues (e.g., code execution) although this is not stated definitively.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Crafted Graphite Smart Font:** Attackers must craft a special Graphite font file.
   - **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely if a user opens a web page or document that loads or references the crafted font.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs to be able to deliver or induce the user into loading the crafted Graphite font file. This could be via a website or a document containing such fonts. No special position or elevated privilege is mentioned.

**Additional Technical Details**

*   The bugzilla entry for [Bug 1248805](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1248805) provides more context, including a test case for the vulnerability which could aid in reproducing and understanding the issue. This also details that the vulnerability was located during fuzzing of the Graphite2 code, a common technique for finding such issues.
*   The SUSE advisories and other documents confirm the impact and affected versions to be applications using the Graphite2 library, like Mozilla Firefox.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is to update to a version of the Graphite2 library that has the issue resolved, specifically, Graphite 2 version 1.3.6 or higher.
