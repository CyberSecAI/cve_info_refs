Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple processes within IBM QRadar SIEM run with higher privileges than necessary. This unnecessary privilege usage is the root cause of the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Excessive Privileges:** The core weakness is that several processes within QRadar SIEM are operating with elevated privileges that they don't require for their function.
-   **Abuse Potential:** This weakness becomes a vulnerability when combined with other vulnerabilities such as shell command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   The vulnerability can be abused when combined with other vulnerabilities like shell command injection.
-  The specific impact is not stated but could potentially include unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise due to the privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Exploitation requires combining this privilege issue with other vulnerabilities such as shell command injection.
-   The attacker would need to be able to leverage the shell command injection vulnerabilities to run code with the excessive privileges associated with the vulnerable processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have the capability to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as shell command injection vulnerabilities, in the affected IBM QRadar SIEM system to take advantage of the excessive privileges.
-   No specific initial access requirements or position is specified other than the need to exploit shell command injection vulnerabilities.

**Summary:** This CVE describes a vulnerability where multiple processes in IBM QRadar SIEM run with excessive privileges. This, when combined with other vulnerabilities, like shell command injection, can lead to a system compromise. The excessive privileges are the root cause that an attacker can use to escalate the impact of shell command injection vulnerabilities.
