| CVE ID | [CVE-2016-2006](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-2006) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Data Protector](http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/w1/en/software/information-management-data-protector.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within OmniInet.exe which listens by default on TCP port 5555. When parsing a malformed domain field in an EXEC\_BAR request, the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context of SYSTEM. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Hewlett Packard Enterprise has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
