Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the `OmniInet.exe` process handles the parsing of the domain field within an `EXEC_BAR` request. Specifically, it blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  The core issue is a stack buffer overflow. The `OmniInet.exe` process doesn't validate the size of the domain field before copying it into a fixed-size buffer allocated on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. The code will run with the privileges of the `SYSTEM` account, giving the attacker complete control over the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.
*   **Specific Protocol:** The exploit targets the `OmniInet.exe` service, which listens on TCP port 5555 by default.
*   **Malformed Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious `EXEC_BAR` request with an overly long domain field to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target system on TCP port 5555.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable by anyone with network access.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-12-22 and publicly disclosed on 2016-04-27.
*   The vulnerability affects Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Protector.
*   The CVSS score is 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
