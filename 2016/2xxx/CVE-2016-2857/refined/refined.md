{
  "CVE-2016-2857": {
    "description": "Qemu emulator built with the IP checksum routines is vulnerable to an OOB read access issue. It could occur while computing checksum for TCP/UDP packets, as the function uses payload length from the packet without checking against the data buffer size.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read issue in QEMU's IP checksum calculation routines. The `net_checksum_calculate` function uses payload length from the packet without verifying it against the size of the actual data buffer, potentially leading to reads beyond the buffer's boundary.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A user inside the guest can exploit this vulnerability to read excessive bytes or crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS), or leak host memory.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is within the guest OS, where a malicious user can craft specific TCP/UDP packets to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the guest operating system.",
    "other_info": "The vulnerability is related to how QEMU computes checksum for TCP/UDP packets. It was discovered by Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. The fix involves adding a check to make sure the payload length is not exceeding the buffer size."
