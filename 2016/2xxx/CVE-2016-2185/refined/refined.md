Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-2185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `ati_remote2_probe` function in the Linux kernel's `drivers/input/misc/ati_remote2.c` does not properly validate the `endpoints` value in a USB device descriptor. This lack of validation leads to a null pointer dereference when the driver attempts to access a device with a crafted or invalid descriptor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The core issue is that the `ati_remote2` driver does not check if the USB device has valid endpoint descriptors before using them. Specifically, it does not ensure a minimum number of endpoints and fails to validate if required endpoint descriptors are actually present.

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The missing validation allows a specially crafted USB device to provide an invalid or missing endpoint descriptor. When the driver later tries to access this missing data, it leads to a null pointer dereference and a subsequent system crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a kernel crash (NULL pointer dereference). This makes the system unusable, requiring a reboot to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** The attack requires a physically proximate attacker, meaning the attacker must have physical access to the system to be able to plug in the malicious USB device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access:** As stated in the attack vectors, the attacker needs physical access to the targeted system.
*   **Malicious USB device:** The attacker needs a crafted or modified USB device to trigger the vulnerable code path in the `ati_remote2` driver.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information suggests that the vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions before 4.5.1.
*   SUSE identifies the vulnerability as "moderate" severity.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by simply plugging in the malicious USB device, and requires no further user interaction.
*   SUSE has released various security advisories for a range of products and versions to address this vulnerability (along with other related issues).

This vulnerability, as noted in the advisories, is one of several USB driver issues stemming from improper descriptor validation.
