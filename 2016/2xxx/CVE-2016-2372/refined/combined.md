# USN-3031-1: Pidgin vulnerabilities

12 July 2016

Pidgin could be made to crash or run programs if it received
specially crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pidgin](/security/cves?package=pidgin) - graphical multi-protocol instant messaging client for X

## Details

Yves Younan discovered that Pidgin contained multiple issues in the MXit

protocol support. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Pidgin to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [libpurple0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.10.11-0ubuntu4.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.10.11-0ubuntu4.2)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libpurple0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.10.9-0ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.10.9-0ubuntu3.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libpurple0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.10.3-0ubuntu1.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.10.3-0ubuntu1.7)

After a standard system update you need to restart Pidgin to make all the

necessary changes.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0140

## Pidgin MXIT File Transfer Length Memory Disclosure Vulnerability

##### June 21, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-2372

### DESCRIPTION

An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in an out of bounds read. A malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle can send an invalid size for a file transfer which will trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could result in a denial of service or copy data from memory to the file, resulting in an information leak if the file is sent to another user.

### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.9 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

### TESTED VERSIONS

Pidgin 2.10.11

### PRODUCT URLs

https://www.pidgin.im/

### DETAILS

When a file transfer is received via the MXIT server, the server will send a CP\_CHUNK\_GET command. This will be handled by the function mxit\_parse\_cmd\_media at lines 2195-2206 of mxit/protocol.c.

```
2195	case CP_CHUNK_GET :					/* get file response */
		{
			struct getfile_chunk chunk;

			/* decode the chunked data */
			memset( &chunk, 0, sizeof( struct getfile_chunk ) );
2201		mxit_chunk_parse_get( &records[0]->fields[0]->data[sizeof( char ) + sizeof( int )], records[0]->fields[0]->len, &chunk );

			/* process the getfile */
2204		mxit_xfer_rx_file( session, chunk.fileid, chunk.data, chunk.length );
		}
2206	break;

```

At line 2201 it will call the function mxit\_chunk\_parse\_get which will read the size of the file (and some other information on the file) into the getfile\_chunk structure. This function is defined in the file mxit/chunk.c and the length is read at line 509:

```
509	pos += get_int32( &chunkdata[pos], &(getfile->length) );

```

After this function has parsed the information and returned, the function mxit\_xfer\_rx\_file will be called at line 2204.

This function is defined in the file mxit/filexfer.c, where at line 445 it will read from the received buffer into the file:

```
445	if ( fwrite( data, datalen, 1, xfer->dest_fp ) > 0 ) {

```

If the length of the chunk that was specified is longer than the buffer, it will result in an out-of-bounds read and the resulting data in memory will be written after the received file. Depending on the memory layout of the program at the time the vulnerability is triggered this could result in a scenario where either program crashes because pages are not accessible or where sensitive data is leaked from memory into the file. The user may decide to copy this file to other places or might send it to another user which would result in the leaking of this data.

Yves Younan of Cisco Talos discovered several vulnerabilities in the
MXit protocol support in pidgin, a multi-protocol instant messaging
client. A remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a
denial of service (application crash), overwrite files, information
disclosure, or potentially to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.0-0+deb8u1.
