# Android Security Bulletin—May 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published May 02, 2016 | Updated May 04, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a
security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The
Nexus firmware images have also been released to the
[Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images).
Security Patch Levels of May 01, 2016 or later address these issues (refer to
the [Nexus documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705)
for instructions on how to check the security patch level).

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on April 04,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have
been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google Service Mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the [Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet,
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* To reflect a broader focus, we renamed this bulletin (and all following in the
  series) to the Android Security Bulletin. These bulletins encompass a broader
  range of vulnerabilities that may affect Android devices, even if they do not
  affect Nexus devices.
* We updated the Android Security
  [severity ratings](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity).
  These changes were the result of data collected over the last six months on
  reported security vulnerabilities and aim to align severities more closely with
  real world impact to users.

## Android and Google Service Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with
  [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside
  of Google Play. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but
  Verify Apps warns users when they attempt to install a detected rooting
  application—no matter where it comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts
  to identify and block installation of known malicious applications that exploit
  a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an application has already been
  installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected
  application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
  pass media to processes such as mediaserver.

## Security Vulnerability Details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2016-05-01 patch level. There is a description of the issue,
a severity rationale, and a table with the CVE, associated bug, severity,
updated Nexus devices, updated AOSP versions (where applicable), and date reported.
When available, we will link the AOSP change that addressed the issue to
the bug ID. When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional AOSP
references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Mediaserver

During media file and data processing of a specially crafted file, a
vulnerability in mediaserver could allow an attacker to cause memory corruption
and remote code execution as the mediaserver process.

The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.

This issue is rated as Critical severity due to the possibility of remote code
execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver
service has access to audio and video streams, as well as access to privileges
that third-party apps could not normally access.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section reviews answers to common questions that may occur after reading
this bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security Patch Levels of May 01, 2016 or later address these issues (refer to
the [Nexus documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705)
for instructions on how to check the security patch level). Device
manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string level to:
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-05-01]

**2. How do I determine which Nexus devices are affected
by each issue?**

In the [Security Vulnerability Details](#security_vulnerability_details)
section, each table has an Updated Nexus devices column that covers the range
of affected Nexus devices updated for each issue. This column has a few
options:

* **All Nexus devices**: If an issue affects all Nexus devices,
  the table will have All Nexus in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
  All Nexus encapsulates the following
  [supported devices](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013),
  Nexus 9, Android One, Nexus Player, and Pixel C.* **Some Nexus devices**: If an issue doesn’t affect all Nexus
    devices, the affected Nexus devices are listed in the *Updated Nexus
    devices* column.
  * **No Nexus devices**: If no Nexus devices are affected by the
    issue, the table will have “None” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.

**3. Why is CVE-2015-1805 included in this bulletin?**

CVE-2015-1805 is included in this bulletin because the [Android Security Advisory—2016-03-18](/docs/security/bulletin/advisory/2016-03-18) was published very close to the release of
the April bulletin. Due to the tight timeline, device manufacturers were given the
option to ship fixes from the [Nexus Security Bulletin—April 2016](/docs/security/bulletin/2016-04-02),
without the fix for CVE-2015-1805, if they used the April 01, 2016 Security Patch Level.
It is included again in this bulletin as it must be fixed in order to use the
May 01, 2016 Security Patch Level.

## Revisions

* May 02, 2016: Bulletin published.
* May 04, 2016:
  + Bulletin revised to include AOSP links.+ List of all Nexus devices updated to include Nexus Player and Pixel C.+ CVE-2016-2447 updated to CVE-2016-4477, per MITRE request.
