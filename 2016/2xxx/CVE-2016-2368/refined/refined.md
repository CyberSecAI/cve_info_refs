Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper use of the `g_snprintf` function within the Pidgin MXIT plugin. `g_snprintf` returns the number of bytes that *would have been written* if the buffer were large enough, not the number of bytes actually written. The MXIT plugin uses this return value as an index/offset into strings without checking if it's within the bounds of the buffer. This can cause buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the unchecked use of `g_snprintf` return values as indices when manipulating strings.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The unchecked length can cause the program to read past the end of a buffer.
- Specifically, the identified vulnerable functions are:
    - `mxit_send_invite`
    - `mxit_queue_packet`
    - `mxit_send_message`
    - `mxit_write_http_post`
    - `mxit_send_splashclick`
    - `mxit_send_suggest_search`
    - `mxit_send_msgevent`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** By overflowing buffers, attackers could overwrite parts of memory used for program control, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to application crashes due to memory corruption.
- **Information Leak:** Out-of-bounds reads could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, potentially from memory locations outside of the intended buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Traffic:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by specially crafted data sent via the MXIT protocol. An attacker would need to send malicious MXIT data to a vulnerable Pidgin client.
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker could act as a malicious server or compromise a legitimate MXIT server to send malicious data.
- **User Input:** Some vulnerabilities are caused by user provided data (e.g. search text), which an attacker can manipulate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Pidgin client.
- **MXIT Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious MXIT data.
- **Server Compromise:** The attacker could leverage a compromised or malicious MXIT server to deliver the malicious payloads.
- **User Interaction:** In some scenarios, tricking users to input a long string is required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Talos report mentions that 12 calls to `g_snprintf` across 7 functions were the most problematic in terms of data coming from untrusted sources.
- The Gentoo advisory states the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-3620-1) confirms the vulnerability and lists the affected Pidgin versions, as well as the fix version.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3031-1) provides similar information and lists affected versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Yves Younan of Cisco Talos.

**Summary**

CVE-2016-2368 is a serious vulnerability affecting the Pidgin MXIT plugin. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect use of `g_snprintf` which allows a remote attacker to cause buffer overflows via specially crafted data. This could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.
