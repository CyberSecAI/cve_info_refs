{
  "CVE-2016-2833": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) does not block cross-domain Java applets because the Java plugin mediates all network requests without checking against the CSP.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Java plugin bypasses CSP restrictions, allowing cross-domain applets to load even when explicitly prohibited by the policy.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can manipulate content through a Java applet to bypass CSP protections, potentially enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious website loads a Java applet from a different domain, bypassing CSP restrictions.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious website with a crafted Java applet."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Content Security Policy (CSP) does not block the loading of cross-domain Java applets when specified by policy, because the Java plugin loads the applet and mediates network requests without checking against CSP.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Content Security Policy (CSP) is circumvented by Java applets, as they load via the Java plugin, which does not enforce CSP restrictions.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious website can load cross-domain Java applets despite CSP restrictions, which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
      "Attack vectors": "By embedding a cross-domain Java applet via <applet>, <object>, or <embed> tags within a malicious webpage.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage containing cross-domain Java applet that the user is tricked into accessing"
