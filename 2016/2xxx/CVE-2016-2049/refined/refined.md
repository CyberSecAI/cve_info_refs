Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2049:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how php-openid verifies the `openid.realm` parameter. It relies on the PHP `$SERVER['SERVER_NAME']` variable, which is often derived from the HTTP `Host` header. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `Host` header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to Host header manipulation. Web servers often derive the `SERVER_NAME` from the `Host` header, which can be controlled by an attacker.
- **Insecure OpenID Realm Validation:** php-openid's reliance on the `SERVER_NAME` to validate the `openid.realm` allows for a mismatch between the intended realm and the actual server handling the request.
- **Lack of Proper Realm Verification:** The application doesn't verify the `openid.realm` against a trusted list or any other reliable source beyond the server name, making it vulnerable to this manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking:** By manipulating the `Host` header during an OpenID authentication request, an attacker can trick a vulnerable website (S) into accepting an authentication request intended for a different server (the attacker's evil.com). This allows the attacker to gain access to the victim's account on S.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) like attack:** The attacker first needs to lure a victim to log into an attacker-controlled website with a legitimate OpenID provider.
- **Host Header Manipulation:** The attacker then intercepts the successful authentication request and replays it, with the Host header changed to the victim's vulnerable website S.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept or manipulate HTTP requests between a client and the vulnerable website S.
- The attacker must have a server to trick the victim into initiating an OpenID login (evil.com in the description)
- The attacker also requires an OpenID account

**Additional details:**
- The provided content gives a good description of the attack scenario.
- It specifically highlights the vulnerable code in php-openid: <https://github.com/openid/php-openid/blob/fb4cdfcaa578436c451f8e8687dfb61165074488/examples/consumer/common.php#L109>
- The vulnerability exists because `SERVER_NAME` is derived from the `Host` header.
