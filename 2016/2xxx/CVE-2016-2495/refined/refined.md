Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a regression introduced by a previous fix for bug 28076789 in `SampleTable.cpp`. The initial fix disallowed the time-to-sample table size to be zero, but this restriction was found to be overly strict and created an issue. This patch re-allows a table size of zero while maintaining the security of the previous fix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness was an overly restrictive check on the time-to-sample table size in Mediaserver. The initial fix for bug 28076789 incorrectly disallowed a table size of zero, when it should have been allowed. This regression caused a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (device hang or reboot) by providing a specially crafted media file that results in a zero-sized time-to-sample table.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through specially crafted media files that can be processed by Mediaserver. This can occur through various methods, including MMS, email attachments, and web browsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send a specially crafted media file to the affected device. This could involve sending an MMS message with the malicious file, having the victim open a malicious web page with an embedded media file, or another mechanism to provide media to the device.
