Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2951:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the usage of weak encryption within IBM Tivoli Remote Control, leading to weaker than expected security.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak encryption algorithms or insufficient key lengths are used to protect data transmitted/stored by IBM Tivoli Remote Control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to a compromise of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted through the remote control system. This could include eavesdropping and unauthorized manipulation of remote systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability would likely be exploited by intercepting network traffic and decrypting the data due to the weak encryption.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the remote control server and the client/target systems. No specific privileged access within the network is described, but an attacker needs to be able to passively or actively monitor the traffic.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in IBM BigFix Remote Control 9.1.3 application update.
- The specific details of the weak encryption algorithm are not provided.
