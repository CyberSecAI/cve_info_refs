Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the Audit > Access tab of the Apache Ranger policy admin tool. The `eventTime` parameter, used in an underlying call when a user clicks on a policyId, is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses user-supplied input (`eventTime` parameter) in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL code on the underlying database. This could lead to:
    - Data breaches (accessing sensitive information).
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
    - Potential compromise of the application or server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `/service/plugins/policies/eventTime` URL.
- An admin user would need to send a crafted `eventTime` parameter containing malicious SQL code when triggering the request by clicking a policyId.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an admin user of the Apache Ranger policy admin tool.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable functionality by navigating to the Audit > Access tab and triggering the underlying call through a policyId click.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads and insert them into the `eventTime` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing native SQL queries with JPA named queries.
- The affected versions are Apache Ranger 0.5.0 up to 0.5.3.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mateusz Olejarka from SecuRing.
