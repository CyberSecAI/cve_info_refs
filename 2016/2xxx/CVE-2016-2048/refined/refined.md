Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A regression in Django 1.9 caused the "Save as new" functionality within the ModelAdmin interface (when `save_as=True` is set) to not properly enforce the "add" permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Permission Check:** When a ModelAdmin uses `save_as=True`, Django's admin interface provides a "Save as new" option. The vulnerability lies in the fact that users with only "change" permissions (but lacking "add" permission) were not blocked from creating new objects through this feature. This is a regression from previous behavior, which correctly enforced the "add" permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Object Creation:** A user with "change" permissions, which normally would allow them to only modify existing objects, could create new objects by using the "Save as new" option. This bypasses the intended access control mechanism.
- **Data Integrity Issues:** Depending on the ModelAdmin and related models, an attacker could potentially create arbitrary entries that violate the intended structure and relationships of the application data model.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Interface:** The attack vector is through the Django admin interface. The user must access an edit form for a ModelAdmin that has `save_as=True` configured.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a user authenticated to the Django admin interface with at least "change" permissions for the affected model. They specifically must *lack* "add" permissions.
- **Knowledge of `save_as=True` Configuration:** The attacker doesn't need specific knowledge of the vulnerability, but needs to identify a ModelAdmin with `save_as=True` enabled.
