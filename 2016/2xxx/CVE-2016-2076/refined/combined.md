VMware Security Advisory Advisory ID: VMSA-2016-0004VMware Security Advisory Synopsis: VMware product updates address a critical security issue in the VMware Client Integration PluginVMware Security Advisory Issue date: 2016-04-14VMware Security Advisory Updated on: 2016-04-14 (Initial Advisory)VMware Security Advisory CVE numbers: CVE-2016-2076
##### 1. Summary

VMware vCenter Server, vCloud Director (vCD), vRealize Automation (vRA) Identity Appliance, and the Client Integration Plugin (CIP) updates address a critical security issue.

**2. Relevant Releases**

vCenter Server 6.0 prior to 6.0 U2
vCenter Server 5.5 U3a, U3b, U3c
vCloud Director 5.5.5
vRealize Automation Identity Appliance 6.2.4

**3. Problem Description**

a. Critical VMware Client Integration Plugin incorrect session handling
The VMware Client Integration Plugin does not handle session content in a safe way. This may allow for a Man in the Middle attack or Web session hijacking in case the user of the vSphere Web Client visits a malicious Web site.

The vulnerability is present in versions of CIP that shipped with:

- vCenter Server 6.0 (any 6.0 version prior to 6.0 U2)
- vCenter Server 5.5 U3a, U3b, U3c
- vCloud Director 5.5.5
- vRealize Automation Identity Appliance 6.2.4

In order to remediate the issue, both the server side (i.e. vCenter

Server, vCloud Director, and vRealize Automation Identity Appliance) and the client side (i.e. CIP of the vSphere Web Client) will need to be updated.

The steps to remediate the issue are as follows:

A) Install an updated version of:
- vCenter Server
- vCloud Director

- vRealize Automation Identity Appliance

B) After step A), update the Client Integration Plugin on the system from which the vSphere Web Client is used. Updating the plugin on vSphere and vRA Identity Appliance is explained in VMware Knowledge Base article 2145066. Updating the plugin on vCloud Director is initiated by a prompt when connecting the vSphere Web Client to the updated version of vCloud Director.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-2076 to this issue.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.
