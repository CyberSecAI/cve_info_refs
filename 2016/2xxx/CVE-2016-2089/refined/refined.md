Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-2089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `jas_matrix_clip` function within the JasPer library. This function processes JPEG 2000 image files and contains a flaw related to how it handles matrix data. Specifically, it doesn't properly check if `matrix->rows_` pointer is NULL before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The code attempts to access `matrix->rows_[0]` without ensuring that `matrix->rows_` is a valid (non-NULL) pointer. If the pointer is NULL it will lead to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted JPEG 2000 image can trigger this flaw, causing the application using the JasPer library to crash. This results in a denial of service as the application becomes unusable.
- **Application crash**: The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a crash of the application that uses the vulnerable version of the `jasper` library

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JPEG 2000 Images:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted JPEG 2000 image files that, when parsed by JasPer, lead to the vulnerable code path within the `jas_matrix_clip` function. This image could be delivered via various methods such as through a website, email, or other file transfers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a manipulated JPEG 2000 image to the targeted system/application.
- No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes**
- Some sources indicate that the vulnerability was initially reported as an "invalid read," but it is more accurately described as a NULL pointer dereference.
- Patches were developed by SUSE and Red Hat to fix this vulnerability
- The vulnerability was fixed upstream in version 1.900.3
