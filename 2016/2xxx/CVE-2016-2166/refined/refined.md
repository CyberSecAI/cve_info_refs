Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2166:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Apache Qpid Proton's Python bindings not properly handling the scenario where an 'amqps:' scheme is specified for a connection but the necessary SSL libraries are unavailable. Instead of failing securely, the code silently falls back to an unencrypted connection, without notifying the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure fallback:** The code defaults to an insecure connection when SSL is not available despite the user requesting a secure connection using the `amqps` scheme.
- **Lack of user notification:** The application fails silently when SSL is not available, meaning that the user remains unaware of the insecure connection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data exposure:** When a secure (amqps) connection is requested but SSL is not available, the application will send sensitive data unencrypted, exposing data to interception by attackers.
- **Loss of confidentiality:** Attackers positioned on the network can potentially eavesdrop on communications intended to be confidential

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the server can intercept the unencrypted communications.
- **Network eavesdropping:** Attackers with access to the network can passively monitor the unencrypted traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server. This can include being on the same local network or having access to network infrastructure along the route.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was present in `proton-0.12.0` and was fixed in `proton-0.12.1`.
- The vulnerable code was located in `proton-c/bindings/python/proton/reactor.py` specifically around lines 529, 695 and 825.
- The fix included changes to ensure that an exception is raised when `amqps` is requested and SSL libraries are missing.
