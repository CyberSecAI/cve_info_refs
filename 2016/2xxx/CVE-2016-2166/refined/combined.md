#### Description

See <https://github.com/apache/qpid-proton/blob/master/proton-c/bindings/python/proton/reactor.py#L529>

If 'amqps:' is specified and the SSL libraries are not available the client will use an unsecured connection instead. This is done silently so the user is not aware of the security violation.
