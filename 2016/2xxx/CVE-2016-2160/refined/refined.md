Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the s2i (source-to-image) build container, when launched outside of Kubernetes control, did not drop capabilities, allowing for privilege escalation using `su` or `sudo`. Attackers could exploit this by creating a new builder image with a modified root password or by overriding builder image scripts (e.g., `assemble`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Capability Dropping:** The s2i build container lacked the capability dropping mechanism applied to regular pods under the restricted Security Context Constraints (SCC), leading to excessive privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to use `su` or `sudo` within the s2i build container, due to missing capability drops, enabled an attacker to escalate to root privileges.
*   **Builder Image Manipulation:**  Attackers could create a new builder image with a modified root password.
*   **Script Overriding:**  Attackers could override builder image scripts (e.g., `assemble`) to execute commands as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation would grant an attacker root privileges within the s2i build container.
*   **Pod Access:** Attackers could gain access to the pod.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers could perform remote command execution within the pod.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Builder Image:** Attackers could create a malicious s2i builder image with a modified root password.
*   **Modified Build Scripts:** Attackers could provide source code that includes a modified `.s2i/bin/assemble` or other scripts that exploit the elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create or modify s2i builder images:** The attacker must have the ability to create or modify s2i builder images used in the OpenShift environment.
*   **Knowledge of s2i build process:**  A basic understanding of how s2i builds work would be necessary to effectively override scripts or modify the builder image.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The fix was implemented by dropping the same capabilities that are dropped for regular pods when running under the restricted SCC.
* The fix was implemented in the openshift/origin project, specifically in pull request #7864.
* Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 1316127 tracks the vulnerability and the fix which is provided via errata RHSA-2016:1064.
* A documentation note mentions: "A flaw was found in the building of containers within OpenShift Enterprise. An attacker could submit an image for building that executes commands within the container as root, allowing them to potentially escalate privileges."
