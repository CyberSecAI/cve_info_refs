### @csrwng **[csrwng](/csrwng)** commented [Mar 8, 2016](#issue-139344968)

The container that is launched by s2i (outside of Kube control) currently allows an escalation of privilege via su or sudo. We can prevent this by dropping the same capabilities that are dropped for regular pods when running under the restricted SCC.

Fixes BZ 1315187

Overridding builder image scripts(e.g. assemble) can help the attackers to access the pod and/or perform remote command execution in it.
