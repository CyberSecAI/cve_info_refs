Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2140:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how OpenStack Nova's libvirt driver handles disk format information during instance resize/migration. Specifically, when using raw storage and "use_cow_images = False", Nova doesn't copy the `disk.info` file during these operations. Instead, after a resize/migration, Nova re-inspects the disk format, allowing a malicious user to overwrite an ephemeral or root disk with a crafted image that presents a false `qcow2` header. This tricks Nova into using a user-specified backing file, granting access to arbitrary files on the compute host.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure disk format handling:**  Nova relies on re-inspecting the disk format after resize/migration instead of preserving the existing format details.
*   **Missing disk metadata:** The `disk.info` file is not properly copied or recreated on the destination host during resize/migration, leading to an inconsistent state.
*   **Trust of `qemu-img` output:**  Nova trusts the output of `qemu-img info` when resolving disk formats, without validating it against other sources of truth.
*   **Use of raw storage:** The vulnerability is only exploitable when using raw storage with `use_cow_images = False` which is a non-default and less secure setting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Host data leak:** An authenticated user, by manipulating a disk image within an instance, can gain read-only access to arbitrary files on the compute host. This could include sensitive data from the host file system, other instances or block devices.
*   **Potential for further compromise:** Although direct write access is not obtained, access to host data can open the door to other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Instance compromise:** A user creates an instance with an ephemeral disk using a flavour that has an ephemeral disk.
2.  **Malicious image creation:** From within the instance, the user writes a malicious image to their ephemeral disk. This image is crafted with a fake qcow2 header which includes a backing file to a host location
3.  **Trigger resize/migration:** The user then requests a resize or migration (live or cold) of their instance.
4.  **Exploitation post-operation:**  Upon the instance restart on the destination host, the re-inspection of the disk triggers the vulnerability, granting the malicious user access to the host's specified backing file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authenticated OpenStack user:** An attacker needs a valid OpenStack user account with the ability to create instances and request resizing/migration.
*   **Access to the instance:** The attacker must be able to execute commands inside the instance, specifically to manipulate the disk.
*   **Non-default libvirt configuration:** The target OpenStack environment must use raw storage and have "use_cow_images = False" set in the `nova.conf`

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Nova versions `<=2015.1.3, >=12.0.0 <=12.0.2`.
*   The vulnerability exists with resize, live-migration and cold-migration scenarios.
*   The issue is mitigated by SELinux if the backing file is not accessible under the qemu context. However if Nova exposes qcow2 in the disk XML then SELinux will allow access.
*   The fix involves ensuring disk.info is properly copied/recreated during resize/migration and not relying on the re-inspection. Patches for Kilo, Liberty, and Mitaka are available.
*   The issue is further exacerbated by libvirt allowing a host block device to be specified as a backing file
*   Live migrations are exploitable, since the disk.info is regenerated in pre\_live\_migration. A reboot is required after a live migration to trigger the issue.
*   Shelve/unshelve is not exploitable due to protections in `nova/virt/images.fetch_to_raw`
*   There is discussion around not trusting qemu-img and instead building metadata prior to the disk being created. This is discussed to be resolved in a future release.

This analysis provides more details than the original CVE description, which simply states that a vulnerability exists in Nova resize/migration that could lead to reading arbitrary files from the compute host.
