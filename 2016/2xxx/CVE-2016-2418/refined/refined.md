Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-2418:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from uninitialized `MetadataBufferType` pointers within the `IOMX.cpp` file. Specifically, the pointers are not initialized when handling the following cases: `SET_INPUT_SURFACE`, `STORE_META_DATA_IN_BUFFER`, and `CREATE_INPUT_SURFACE`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Uninitialized memory: The `MetadataBufferType` pointers are left uninitialized, which means they can contain arbitrary values. When these pointers are dereferenced, it could lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Information disclosure: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information due to the uninitialized memory.  The vulnerability is rated as High severity because it could be used to gain elevated capabilities, such as Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions privileges, which are not accessible to a third-party application.

**Attack vectors:**

- Local malicious application: A local malicious application could trigger the vulnerable code path by interacting with the `IOMX` component in a specific way.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker would need to have the ability to run a local application on the target device.
