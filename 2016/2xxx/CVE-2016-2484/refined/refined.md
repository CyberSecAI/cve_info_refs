Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `libOmxVenc` component of MediaServer.
*   It stems from a heap overflow due to insufficient safety checks when freeing buffers. Specifically, the code did not correctly track the number of allocated buffers, leading to a potential over-free.
*   The issue is related to how input/output buffers are managed on ports. The allocation bitmap was only 64-wide and there was a lack of checks when freeing buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The vulnerability allows writing beyond the allocated buffer boundaries due to incorrect memory management during buffer deallocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This heap overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the MediaServer process. This is because the attacker can potentially overwrite parts of the heap with malicious data and then cause a branch to that data.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:**  The MediaServer process has access to audio and video streams and has elevated privileges compared to regular third-party applications. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain local access to these elevated capabilities, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted media file or data that triggers the heap overflow.
*   This can be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   **MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service):** Sending a specially crafted media file via MMS.
    *   **Web Browsing:** Triggering playback of malicious media content on a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted media file to the vulnerable device.
*   No specific user interaction may be required beyond receiving and processing the malicious media content (depending on the exact attack scenario).
*   The attacker can be remote if they can send a file through MMS, have the user browse to a malicious web page, etc.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved limiting the number of buffers allocated on input/output ports to 64, as the allocation bitmap is 64-wide.
*   Safety checks were added to ensure that only the allocated number of buffers is freed during deallocation.
*   The provided content also indicates that this vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities fixed in the June 2016 Android Security Bulletin.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Heap overflow in `libOmxVenc` due to incorrect buffer management during deallocation
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution and Local Privilege Escalation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Specially crafted media files via MMS or web browsing.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send the malicious media content to the vulnerable device.
