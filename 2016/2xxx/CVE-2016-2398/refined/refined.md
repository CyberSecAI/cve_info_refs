Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Comcast Xfinity Home Security system uses a ZigBee-based protocol over a 2.4 GHz radio frequency band for communication between sensors (doors, windows, motion) and the base station.
*   The system **fails to fail securely** (also described as 'failing open'). When communication between sensors and the base station is disrupted, the system does not trigger any alarms, and it continues to report that all sensors are secure.
*   The system takes minutes to hours to re-establish communications, during which time no alarm escalation occurs.
*   The system doesn't provide indication that communication was interrupted and that sensors might have been open during the outage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Fail Open:** The system does not alert the user to communication disruptions but continues to report that all sensors are secure, even when they are not.
*   **Lack of Alerting:** The system fails to alert when communication is lost, and when sensors come back online, it provides no information that the sensor was offline and may have been triggered.
*  **Long Re-Establishment Time**: It takes the sensors a long time (minutes to hours) to re-establish communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can bypass the alarm system by disrupting wireless communications between sensors and the base station using radio jamming equipment.
*   This allows intruders to open doors and windows or move through the property without triggering an alarm.
*   Homeowners are given a false sense of security.
*   The sign provided to customers can be an invitation to attack for people aware of the system's vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Radio Jamming:** An attacker uses radio jamming equipment to block ZigBee signals between sensors and the base station. This can be purchased or made with DIY instructions online.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the ZigBee radio signal to perform the jamming attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range of the system's ZigBee signal to disrupt communications.
*   **Radio Jamming Equipment:** An attacker needs access to or ability to build radio jamming equipment that operates in the 2.4 GHz range.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond to the reports.
*   The vendor stated that this is an "industry issue" and that they will work with the industry to address it.
*   The system does not "fail closed" but "open".
*   A firmware patch was suggested as a potential solution.
