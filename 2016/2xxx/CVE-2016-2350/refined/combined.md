### Overview

The Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) contains multiple vulnerabilites that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Accellion File Transfer appliance contains multiple vulnerabilities in versions below FTA\_9\_12\_40.  [**CWE-79**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2016-2350The Accellion File Transfer Appliance versions below contains three cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML content (including script) within the following:     + move\_partition\_frame.html + getimageajax.php + wmInfo.html  [**CWE-89:**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** - CVE-2016-2351The Accellion File Transfer Appliance contains a SQL injection vulnerability due to improper escaping of the parameter 𠆌lient\_id’ in `/home/seos/courier/security\_key2.api, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code in 𠆌lient\_id,” and recover private data.[**CWE-77:**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html) **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')-** CVE-2016-2352The Accellion File Transfer Appliance is vulnerable to command injection due to unsafe handling of restricted users utilizing the YUM\_CLIENT. This allows a restricted user to execute any command via root permission. [**CWE-276:**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html) **Incorrect Default Permissions** - CVE-2016-2353The Accellion File Transfer Appliance is vulnerable to local privilege escalation due to a misconfiguration. By default, the appliance allows a restricted user to add their SSH key to an alternate user group with additional permissions. |
