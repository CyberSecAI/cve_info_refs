```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of parameters/configuration data passed to the `get/set_config()/parameter()` methods in the `omx_vdec` component within Mediaserver.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insufficient input validation of configuration data.
- Potential for arbitrary writes due to unchecked parameters.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary write capabilities within the context of the Mediaserver process. This could lead to elevation of privileges, allowing malicious code execution with the elevated permissions of the Mediaserver process.

Attack vectors:
A local malicious application can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious input data and then calling methods that handle media.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to have a local application installed on the device.
- The application needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable Mediaserver component by calling methods that handle media, such as video decoding.
