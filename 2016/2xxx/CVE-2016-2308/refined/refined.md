- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passwords stored in plaintext in a file accessible without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plaintext storage of passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to user logins and passwords, potentially leading to full system compromise. This includes the ability to access all aspects of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation is possible. The vulnerability exists in a file accessible without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-skilled attacker is capable of exploiting this vulnerability. No specific privileges or position on the network are necessary since this is remotely exploitable.
