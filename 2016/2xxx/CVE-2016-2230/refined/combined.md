## Description

[![@cyclotron3k](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3222878?v=4&size=48)](/cyclotron3k)[cyclotron3k](https://github.com/cyclotron3k)opened [on Dec 27, 2015](https://github.com/RasPlex/RasPlex/issues/453#issue-123978521)

SSH is enabled by default, the default login details are widely published. People are exposing their RasPlex installs to the web.

Even if they aren't putting them in a DMZ, or otherwise exposing them to the web, it's still horribly insecure by default.

Bizarrely, you're prevented from changing the default password because `passwd` is missing.

Possible solutions:

a) Make SSH off by default, force a password to be set the first time SSH is enabled

b) Generate a random password and show it in settings.

## OpenELEC and RasPlex have a hard-coded SSH root password

#### Vulnerability Note VU#544527

Original Release Date: 2016-02-02 | Last Revised: 2016-02-02

---

### Overview

[OpenELEC](http://openelec.tv/) and derivatives utilize a hard-coded default root password, and enable SSH root access by default.

### Description

| [**CWE-259**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Password**  OpenELEC has a [hard-coded root password.](http://wiki.openelec.tv/index.php?title=OpenELEC_FAQ#SSH_Password_change) The root partition is by default read-only, preventing a user from changing the password once installed; furthermore, SSH access is enabled by default.[RasPlex](http://www.rasplex.com/) is based on OpenELEC and therefore [inherits](https://github.com/RasPlex/RasPlex/issues/453) this same problem.According to RasPlex, "The root filesystem is read only (squashfs). This prevents the ability to change the root password, but also prevents an attacker from modifying the filesystem." |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may gain root access to the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a full solution to this issue. Affected users may consider the following mitigations:**Disable SSH password access**Disable the use of password access to SSH, and enable [SSH keys](http://wiki.openelec.tv/index.php?title=Config_connect_ssh_wo_password) instead.RasPlex notes that "users can simply disable SSH via the dialog if they are worried about being compromised."**Build with a different password**Developers may [build their own distribution](http://wiki.openelec.tv/index.php?title=Compile_from_source) of OpenELEC or RasPlex from source and modify the root password at build time. Users should be aware however that this password is still hard-coded and may leave a user vulnerable to further attack; future password changes would require another rebuild and deployment.**Restrict network access**Use a firewall or similar technology to restrict access to trusted hosts, networks, and services. |
