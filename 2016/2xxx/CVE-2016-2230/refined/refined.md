Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-2230 (though explicitly mentioned, the content clearly relates to VU#544527 which is associated with this CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded default root password in OpenELEC and its derivative, RasPlex.
*   The root filesystem is read-only, preventing users from changing the password after installation.
*   SSH is enabled by default, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password:** The primary weakness is the use of a hardcoded password for the root user.
*  **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default configuration enables SSH with the hardcoded password, which is a major security risk.
* **Read-only Filesystem:** The read-only nature of the root partition prevents users from changing the password, compounding the problem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can gain root access to the affected device. This grants them complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote access via SSH is the attack vector. This is made possible due to the default enabled SSH service using the hardcoded password.
*   The issue is not just limited to systems exposed to the internet; it also affects systems within a local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have network access to the device, either through the internet or a local network.
*   No special privileges or advanced capabilities are required; the default hard-coded password is sufficient to gain access.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability note states that the CERT/CC is not aware of a complete solution.
*   Mitigations include disabling password-based SSH access and using SSH keys or rebuilding the distribution from the source with a different password.
*   The vendor was notified of the vulnerability, but has not yet provided an official statement.
*   The CVSS score is 10 (Critical) indicating the high severity of this issue.
