```
The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.0.6 release!

This release is a security release resolving one major vulnerability and
several other bugs found in the prior Squid releases.

  NP: this release announcement also covers 4.0.5 change details.

The major changes to be aware of:

* SQUID-2016:1 - Remote Denial of Service in SSL/TLS handling

    <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_1.txt>

This shows up as Squid crashing after a failed TLS server connection.
Since Squid built with TLS/SSL support perform outbound TLS server
connections independent of inbound client request type it can be
triggered by a plain-text HTTP message.

 Affected Squid versions are:
   3.5.13, 4.0.4, 4.0.5 built using --with-openssl

See the advisory for further details. Upgrade to this beta is highly
recommended, even for older unaffected Squid-4 releases.

* Several regression bugs fixed

 - Bug 4436: Fix DEFAULT_SSL_CRTD
 - Bug 4429: http(s)_port options= error message missing characters
 - Bug 4410: compile error in basic_ncsa_auth after 4.0.4
 - Bug 4403: helper compile errors after 4.0.4
 - Bug 4401: compile error on Solaris
 - Fix: TLS/SSL flags parsing
 - Fix: cert validator always disabled in 4.0.x
 - Fix: Name-only note ACL stopped matching after 4.0.4 (note -m)
 - Fix: external_acl problems after 4.0.1

* SSL related helpers changed

This release adds two new ./configure options
  --enable-security-validators=
  --enable-security-generators=

These build options operate the same as external ACL and authentication
helper build options. But control whether the SSL certificate validator
and SSL-Bump certificate generator helper(s) are built.

As part of this change;

 - the ssl_crtd helper is renamed to security_file_certgen
   (built with --enable-security-generators=file), and

 - the cert_valid.pl helper is renamed to security_fake_certverify
   (built with --enable-security-validators=fake).

* Add connections_encrypted ACL

This new ACL only matches true when all the external connections
involved with a transaction (so far) have been secured. It can be used
to prohibit sending traffic received over a secure connection to
insecure services such as URL-rewriters, ICAP, eCAP, cache_peer, or to
set tcp_outgoing_* details differently for secure/insecure transactions.

* Fix SSL-Bump step 3 splice action

This bug shows up as Squid HTTPS transactions hanging while contacting
an upstream TLS server. It occurs when splice action is selected for use
at stage 3 of SSL-Bumping.

 All users of Squid-4.0.x are urged to upgrade to this release as soon
as possible.

 All users of Squid-3 are encouraged to test this release out and plan
for upgrades where possible.

 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/RELEASENOTES.html>
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-4

This new release can be downloaded from our HTTP or FTP servers

 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/>
 ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/squid/
 ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/archive/4/

or the mirrors. For a list of mirror sites see

 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html>

If you encounter any issues with this release please file a bug report.

```
The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.14 release!

This release is a security release resolving one major vulnerability and
several other bugs found in the prior Squid releases.

The major changes to be aware of:

* SQUID-2016:1 - Remote Denial of Service in SSL/TLS handling

    <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_1.txt>

This shows up as Squid crashing after a failed TLS server connection.
Since Squid built with TLS/SSL support perform outbound TLS server
connections independent of inbound client request type it can be
triggered by a plain-text HTTP message.

 Affected Squid versions are:
  3.5.13, 4.0.4, 4.0.5 built using --with-openssl

See the advisory for further details. Upgrade to this beta is highly
recommended, even for older unaffected releases.

* Bug #4431: C code is not compiled with CFLAGS

This bug in the build toolchain has existied since at lease 3.2 and
meant the few C objects still being built as part of Squid and helpers
were not being built using the proper CFLAGS values.

Builds for unusual environments or with customised CFLAGS values will
need to take some extra care and testing with this release to ensure the
desired compiler actions are occuring.

* Fix %un logging external ACL username

This issue affects both logging and the key_extras feature of 3.5 which
both rely on logformat codes. It shows up in two ways;

 - For Squid relying exclusively on external ACL helper side-band
authentication the username would not be logged at all.

 - For Squid relying on multiple sources of authentication the username
for another source could wrongly be displayed instead of the external
ACL provided value.

* Fix invalid FTP connection handling on blocked content

This issue shows up as 'hanging' FTP transactions when an ICAP service
has explicitly requested that they be blocked / rejected / denied.

 All users of Squid-3 or older are urged to upgrade to this release as
soon as possible.

 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html>
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-3.5

Upgrade tip:
  "squid -k parse" is starting to display even more
   useful hints about squid.conf changes.

This new release can be downloaded from our HTTP or FTP servers

 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/>
 ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/squid/
 ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/archive/3.5/

or the mirrors. For a list of mirror sites see

 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html>
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/mirrors.html>

If you encounter any issues with this release please file a bug report.
<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2016:1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2016:1
Date: February 16, 2016
Summary: Remote Denial of service issue
in SSL/TLS processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.5.13
Squid 4.0.4 -> 4.0.5
Fixed in version: Squid 4.0.6, 3.5.14
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016\_1.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2390
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrectly handling server errors Squid is vulnerable to
a denial of service attack when connecting to TLS or SSL servers.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
This problem allows any trusted client to perform a denial of
service attack on the Squid service regardless of whether TLS or
SSL is configured for use in the proxy.
Misconfigured client or server software may trigger this issue
to perform a denial of service unintentionally.
However, the bug is exploitable only if Squid is built using the
--with-openssl option.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
These bugs are fixed by Squid version 3.5.14 and 4.0.6.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for stable releases
can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.5:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13981.patch
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid-3.4 and older versions are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.5.12 and older 3.5 versions are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.5 built without OpenSSL support are not vulnerable.
All Squid-4.0.3 and older 4.0 versions are not vulnerable.
All Squid-4 built without OpenSSL support are not vulnerable.
All unpatched Squid-3.5.13, 4.0.4, and 4.0.5 built using
--with-openssl are vulnerable.
The following command can be used to easily determine if a
vulnerable build is being used:
squid -v
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workaround:
Disabling service for https:// URLs entirely at the top of the
squid.conf http\_access rules fully protects against this
vulnerability:
acl HTTPS proto HTTPS
http\_access deny HTTPS
Or,
Relaying outbound HTTPS traffic through a non-vulnerable proxy
protects against the issue unless the SSL-bump splice feature is
being used.
Or,
Disabling service for irregular HTTPS ports protects against the
simplest forms of attack while retaining most HTTPS service:
acl HTTPS proto HTTPS
http\_access deny HTTPS !SSL\_Ports
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your
primary support point. For subscription details see
.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed
list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports
are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-2390 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2390)

#### Description

The FwdState::connectedToPeer method in FwdState.cc in Squid before 3.5.14 and 4.0.x before 4.0.6 does not properly handle SSL handshake errors when built with the --with-openssl option, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a plaintext HTTP message.
