**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory allocation issue in the Cairo graphics layer when interacting with the libav header allocation in FFmpeg version 0.10. This occurs during video decoding when a crafted video file is processed. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from assuming a constant size for the AVFrame structure, while it differs between FFmpeg 0.10 and other versions of LibAV.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect memory allocation when calling `_cairo_surface_get_extents`. Additionally, there were some issues with symbol resolution and incorrect use of `av_free` vs `av_freep`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crafted video could cause a crash in the browser or plugin process due to memory corruption from the buffer overflow.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the reports mention that a successful buffer overflow could potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities to escape the GMP sandbox leading to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a website containing the malicious video.
    *   **User Interaction:** The user must interact with the crafted video.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to host or inject a malicious video on a website that a user will visit.
    *   The attacker does not need to authenticate or have any special privileges, just the ability to deliver malicious content to a Firefox or Thunderbird user on Linux with an affected version of FFMpeg.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by incorrect handling of `AVFrame` size, which is larger in FFmpeg 0.10 (and potentially other versions of LibAV) than anticipated when allocating a buffer by Firefox using cairo.
*   The patch addresses this by:
    *   Correctly determine the size of `AVFrame` using `av_frame_get_buffer_size`.
    *   Ensure that the memory is allocated with `av_frame_alloc`.
    *   Free the AVFrame buffer with `av_frame_free` rather than `av_free`
    *   Fixing the symbol lookup to use avcodec lib instead of avutil
    *   Adding a check if a cairo surface is actually created.

**4. Additional Details from the Bugzilla Report:**

*   The bug is triggered by playing HTML5 video, and the crash consistently points to `_cairo_surface_get_extents`.
*   The vulnerability is reproducible on certain Linux systems using FFmpeg 0.10 or LibAV 0.8 or 9
*   The bug was introduced by a change in `libstagefright`, specifically revision `9a4457502650`
*   The fix involves using the appropriate libav APIs to allocate and free AVFrame, and not make assumptions about its size.

**5.  SUSE Information:**
    *   SUSE rates the issue as having "moderate" severity (CVSS v2 score of 6.8). They list a slightly different vector `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P`, showing partial impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability. The NVD has `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P`, partial impact to availability and no impact on confidentiality and integrity.
     *  SUSE lists the specific package versions of MozillaFirefox needed to resolve the issue. It affects multiple versions of Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop and Server, as well as openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed.
     *  The SUSE advisory details the affected products and provides package upgrade instructions.

**Summary of CVE-2016-2839:**

CVE-2016-2839 describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox and Firefox ESR when processing video content on Linux systems using FFmpeg 0.10. This vulnerability occurs because of an incorrect memory allocation within the cairo graphics library. It can cause a denial of service via application crash or in combination with other bugs can lead to arbitrary code execution. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into loading a crafted video. The vulnerability is resolved by using the appropriate libav APIs to allocate and free AVFrame buffers.
