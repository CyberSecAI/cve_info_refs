Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2571:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Squid incorrectly handles certain malformed responses, specifically in how it proceeds with storing data after a response parsing failure. This is related to http.cc in Squid.
- The vulnerability is triggered when Squid fails to parse an HTTP response, leading to an assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper error handling during HTTP response parsing.
- Lack of proper validation of response structure.
- Insufficient boundary checks in handling responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
- In some cases the issue can lead to an assertion failure and daemon exit.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote HTTP server sends a specially crafted, malformed HTTP response.
- The attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending malformed HTTP responses to the vulnerable Squid proxy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP responses to a Squid proxy server. 
- The attacker can be a malicious HTTP server or an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to inject malicious http responses.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that this issue is fixed in Squid versions 3.5.15 and 4.0.7.
- Several vendors including Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE have released patches to fix this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2016-2569, CVE-2016-2570 and CVE-2016-2572 which share similar root cause or attack vectors.
