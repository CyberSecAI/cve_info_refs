Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-2836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is described as multiple memory safety issues, found in the browser engine of Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird that could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution. The specific technical details of these memory safety issues are not given in the provided context, but they seem related to how the browser engine handles and processes web content. It mentions these vulnerabilities stem from miscellaneous memory safety issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory safety hazards:** The core weakness is a series of memory-related flaws within the browser engine, including possible buffer overflows, use-after-free vulnerabilities and other types of memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a remote attacker could cause the application to crash, thus denying service to legitimate users.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A more severe consequence could be the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the browser, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Information disclosure:** Certain vulnerabilities may also cause information leaks to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The content suggests that the attack vector is primarily remote. An attacker would trick users into opening a specially crafted website, which leverages the browser engine's memory issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious website.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to interact with the malicious website. This makes it less severe than a zero-click exploit, but still allows for widespread exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both Firefox and Thunderbird, as both use the shared browser engine, Gecko.
*   The content indicates that this is considered a **critical** or **important** severity issue.
*   Patches are available that upgrade Firefox/Thunderbird to versions 45.3.0esr or 48.0, addressing the vulnerabilities.
*   The content also mentions that the problems were reported by Mozilla developers and community members, which include names of individuals such as Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight, Phil Ringnalda, and Philipp.

In summary, CVE-2016-2836 describes a set of memory-related vulnerabilities in the core of Firefox and Thunderbird that could enable remote attackers to cause denial of service or execute arbitrary code. The attack vector is based on crafted web content. This vulnerability requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious website.
