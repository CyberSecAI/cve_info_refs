- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Reliance on cookies without validation and integrity checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - The application relies on cookies without proper validation and integrity checks. Attackers can modify cookies within the browser or by implementing client-side code outside the browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can perform administrative operations, potentially allowing the EG2 connection to be configured over the Internet instead of requiring direct network access.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Remotely, by manipulating cookies.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to modify cookies, either through browser manipulation or by using a custom client-side code. The attacker does not require any user interaction.
