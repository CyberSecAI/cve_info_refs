Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-2336:

**Root Cause:** Type confusion vulnerabilities exist within the `WIN32OLE` class in Ruby, specifically in the `ole_invoke` and `ole_query_interface` methods. These methods fail to properly validate the type of objects passed as arguments, leading to exploitable conditions when the attacker provides an object of an unexpected type.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **`ole_invoke` vulnerability:**
    *   The `ole_invoke` function expects the second argument (`paramS`) to be a Ruby array, but it doesn't perform type checking before using it as such.
    *   If an attacker passes a non-array object as `paramS`, the code attempts to treat it as an array, leading to a type confusion vulnerability and likely a crash.

2.  **`ole_query_interface` vulnerability:**
    *   The `fole_query_interface` function expects the `str_iid` argument to be a string representing the interface ID (IID).
    *   It does not check if `str_iid` is indeed a string before using it in `ole_vstr2wc`, which expects a string.
    *   Passing a non-string object leads to a type confusion vulnerability that can result in arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By exploiting the type confusion vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially gain arbitrary code execution on the system. The provided debug analysis for `ole_query_interface` shows a crash caused by trying to read memory at an invalid address, which could be manipulated for code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** If arbitrary code execution is not achieved the program will crash which leads to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to craft malicious Ruby scripts that utilize the `WIN32OLE` class, and specifically call the vulnerable methods (`ole_invoke` and/or `ole_query_interface`), passing the unexpected object type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute Ruby code on the target system.
*   The attacker needs to have access to or be able to create a Ruby script that can interact with the WIN32OLE component.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided report contains Proof of Concept (PoC) code snippets for both vulnerabilities, which highlights how an attacker can trigger these vulnerabilities by passing an integer object instead of a string or array.
*   The vulnerability is present in Ruby versions 2.3.0 dev and 2.2.2.
* The report includes debugger analysis of the crash that occurs when exploiting the vulnerabilities.
