  "CVE-2016-2324": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in Git before 2.7.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename or many nested trees, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by providing crafted repositories via git, potentially leading to complete system compromise",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote unauthenticated attacker with ability to provide crafted git repositories"
