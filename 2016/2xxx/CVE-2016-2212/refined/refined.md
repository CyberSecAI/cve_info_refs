Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2212:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure comparison of data within the `getOrderByStatusUrlKey` method in `/app/code/core/Mage/Rss/Helper/Order.php`. Specifically, the code uses the loose equality operator (`==`) instead of the strict equality operator (`===`) when comparing the `increment_id` and `customer_id` from the user-supplied data with the corresponding values from the loaded order object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Juggling**: The use of `==` allows for type coercion or "type juggling" in PHP, which means that values of different types might be considered equal if their values are similar after conversion.
- **Information Disclosure**: This can lead to information disclosure because an attacker can manipulate the input data to pass the loose comparisons and retrieve order information without needing the exact `increment_id` and `customer_id`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Order Information:** An attacker can retrieve order details, including order comments and other related data, that they would normally not have access to.
- **Data Exposure:** The exposed data includes potentially sensitive customer and order details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **RSS Feed Request Manipulation**: The attacker sends a crafted request to the RSS feed endpoint with a malicious "data" parameter. This parameter contains a base64-encoded JSON string with manipulated `increment_id` and `customer_id` values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Access**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, they only need network access to the vulnerable Magento instance.
- **Knowledge of Order IDs**: Although they don't need the precise customer and increment IDs, the attacker needs to know or be able to guess valid order IDs to retrieve associated order data. The provided exploit script demonstrates how an attacker can enumerate order IDs.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing RSS feed requests related to order status.
- The vulnerable code is located in `Mage_Rss_Helper_Order` class, in the  `getOrderByStatusUrlKey` method.
- The `data` parameter is base64-decoded and JSON-decoded before comparisons.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Magento version 1.9.2.3 and through the SUPEE-7405 patch.
- The vendor acknowledged the issue and awarded a bug bounty to the discoverer.
