Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of URI encoded characters within the Puppet server, specifically in how node names are processed. The Puppet server was not properly unescaping the URI encoded characters in the node name before passing it to the compiler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The Puppet server's API did not correctly handle URI encoded input when extracting the node name from the request path.
*   **Missing URI Unescaping:** Specifically, in `lib/puppet/network/http/api/indirected_routes.rb`, the code previously unescaped the key (`key = URI.unescape(key)`) , this was removed.
*   **Double Unescaping:** The code in `lib/puppet/network/http/rack/rest.rb` was unescaping the path, but the code was also doing it in another part of the code `lib/puppet/network/http/api/indirected_routes.rb`, causing a double unescape in the key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Gentoo security advisory mentions that the worst-case impact could lead to arbitrary code execution, which suggests the vulnerability could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities or used to bypass access controls to achieve code execution on the server.
*   **Node Name Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate the node name by injecting specially crafted URI-encoded characters which might allow them to bypass authorization controls or cause unexpected behavior in the Puppet server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** An attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request to the Puppet server that includes a specially crafted URI-encoded node name.
*  **Manipulated Node Names:** By carefully crafting node names, an attacker could potentially circumvent authentication mechanisms or introduce malicious content into catalog compilations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need to have network access to the Puppet server.
*  **Knowledge of API:** The attacker would need knowledge of the Puppet server's API endpoints for catalog requests
*  **Ability to Send Malicious Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Puppet server with a specific, crafted URI.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub commit history shows the fix involves:
    * Removing the URI unescape from `lib/puppet/network/http/api/indirected_routes.rb`
    * Adding URI unescape on `lib/puppet/network/http/rack/rest.rb`
    * Adding a test to `spec/unit/indirector/catalog/compiler_spec.rb` that asserts the node can contain percent characters.
    * Modifying tests for `spec/unit/network/http/api/indirected_routes_spec.rb` to reflect that the unescape doesn't happen anymore.
    * Adding a test to `spec/unit/network/http/rack/rest_spec.rb` to assert that the unescaped path is correct.
*   The Gentoo security advisory provides version information, stating that `app-admin/puppet-agent` versions before 1.4.2 and `app-admin/puppetserver` versions before 2.3.2 are vulnerable.
