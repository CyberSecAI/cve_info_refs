Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Debuggerd component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Debuggerd component allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to a permanent device compromise, requiring the device to be repaired by reflashing the operating system.
- It can enable an elevation of privilege from system to root.
- Arbitrary code execution within the context of an elevated system application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local malicious application is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**
- Although a code execution bug would typically be rated as critical, this vulnerability is rated as moderate because it only enables an elevation of privilege from system to root in Android version 4.4.4. In Android versions 5.0 and above, SELinux rules prevent third-party applications from reaching the affected code.
- Patches are available in AOSP, and the vulnerability is addressed in the April 2016 security update.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1.
