- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM BigFix Remote Control application is vulnerable to XML injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML Injection. A remote attacker can modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially modify the way the application processes XML, which can lead to various outcomes depending on the application's implementation. The provided text does not specify the precise impact, only that the attacker can modify the XML before it is processed.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the XML before it is processed by an end system.
