Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-2270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Inconsistent cacheability flags on guest mappings in Xen hypervisor.
- Multiple mappings of the same physical page with different cachability settings can cause problems. Specifically, inconsistent cacheability for MMIO (Memory-Mapped I/O) pages can lead to Machine Check exceptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The hypervisor did not properly enforce consistent cachability for MMIO pages.
- Mappings of the same physical page with different cachability settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest administrator can cause a reboot, denying service to the entire host.
- Denial of service for the entire host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest administrator, controlling some physical device and memory mappings, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a guest administrator with control over some physical device.
- The attacker also needs to be able to control the memory mappings within the guest to set the conflicting cacheability flags.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affects only x86 systems and guests given control over physical devices, ARM systems are not affected.
- The vulnerability depends on the system's response to mapping the same memory with different cacheability. This can range from harmless to fatal, depending on CPU and chipset.
- A patch was created to fix the issue but may cause a performance regression. A command line option "mmio-relax" was added to overcome this regression, but enabling this workaround will reinstate the security issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.
- The issue was rated "normal" severity by Gentoo, with "local" exploitability.
- Oracle's bulletin indicates a CVSS v2 risk of 5.2 for Oracle VM Server, with impact on availability.
