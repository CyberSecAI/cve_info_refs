Subject: CVE request Qemu: usb: multiple eof_timers in ohci leads to null
 pointer dereference

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the USB OHCI emulation support is vulnerable to a
null pointer dereference issue. It could occur when OHCI transitions to a
OHCI_USB_OPERATIONAL state, leading to creation of multiple eof timers. A
privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on
the host, resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-02/msg03374.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1304794>

This issue was discovered by Zuozhi Fzz of Alibaba Inc.

Thank you.

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] usb: ohci avoid multiple eof timers

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

When transitioning an OHCI controller to the OHCI_USB_OPERATIONAL
state, it creates an eof timer object in 'ohci_bus_start'.
It does not check if one already exists. This results in memory
leakage and null dereference issue. Add a check to avoid it.

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak

host memory bytes. ([CVE-2016-2538](/security/CVE-2016-2538))

Hongke Yang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NE2000 emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2841](/security/CVE-2016-2841))

Ling Liu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled IP checksum routines. An

attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,

in the VGA module. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this

issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU

is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor

profile. ([CVE-2016-3710](/security/CVE-2016-3710))
