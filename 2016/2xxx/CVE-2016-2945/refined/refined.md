- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is related to the API Discovery feature in WebSphere Application Server Liberty when using Swagger documents with external references. The details of the weakness aren't provided, but it suggests a potential weakness in how external references are handled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the handling of external references within Swagger documents used by the API Discovery feature. This suggests a flaw in how these external references are processed, potentially leading to weaker than expected security.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The provided document mentions "potential for weaker than expected security" but does not specify the full impact of exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by using the API Discovery feature with Swagger documents that have external references. This suggests an attack vector involving crafting malicious or misleading external references within a Swagger document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to provide or influence the Swagger documents used by the WebSphere Application Server Liberty's API Discovery feature. The document does not provide specifics on how this is achieved, but it can be inferred that an attacker can exploit this through having access to, or by being able to provide, these Swagger documents.
