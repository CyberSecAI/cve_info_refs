Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-2279

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley CompactLogix web application. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflective XSS. The web application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, which is then reflected back in the user's browser, allowing execution of arbitrary Javascript code. Specifically, the `name` parameter within the `SysDataDetail` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This allows for:
  -  Session hijacking.
  -  Defacement of the web page.
  -  Redirection of users to malicious sites.
  -  Potentially, gaining control over the user's interactions with the web application.
  -  Stealing of sensitive information accessible to the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript, which is sent to the vulnerable web application.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to click on a malicious link or access a webpage with injected javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
-   The attacker needs to lure a victim into clicking on a malicious URL or visiting the exploited web page.
- The attacker can be remote to the vulnerable device.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**
- The exploit can be triggered remotely.
- Public exploits are available.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of the Allen Bradley CompactLogix controller platform, including discontinued versions.
- The advisory was updated on October 30, 2018, to include additional affected products.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 6.1.
- The attack target is not the CompactLogix controller itself, but rather, it is a vehicle to deliver attacks to the end user's web browser.

The vulnerability is present in the web interface of the Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley CompactLogix controllers which is used to configure and manage the controllers, and is exploitable if an attacker can convince a user to visit a specially crafted URL.
