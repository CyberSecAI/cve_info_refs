Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-2363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The script `/var/www/rpc/surun` has incorrect permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266): The script allows the user 'nobody' to run many commands as root due to improper permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker, after gaining access as the 'nobody' user (potentially through the hardcoded FTP credentials vulnerability CVE-2016-2362), can execute commands as root, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker would need network access to the affected Fonality server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to gain initial access to the system as the 'nobody' user. This could be achieved through the vulnerability related to hardcoded FTP credentials (CVE-2016-2362), which allows FTP access and SSH login as the 'nobody' user. Once logged in as 'nobody', the attacker can leverage the vulnerability in the `surun` script to escalate privileges to root.
