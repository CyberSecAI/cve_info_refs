{
  "CVE-2016-2342": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A `memcpy` function in the VPNv4 NLRI parser of `bgp_mplsvpn.c` does not properly check the upper-bound length of received Labeled-VPN SAFI routes data.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash).",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious BGP peer can send crafted Labeled-VPN SAFI routes.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a BGP peer and must send specially crafted network traffic.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in `bgpd` when configured with BGP peers enabled for VPNv4. This is not a default configuration, so hosts are only vulnerable if explicitly configured to use this."
