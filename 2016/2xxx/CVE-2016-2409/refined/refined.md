  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Texas Instruments haptic kernel driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit would allow a local malicious application to gain kernel level code execution, potentially leading to a permanent device compromise requiring re-flashing the operating system to fix.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the target device. Furthermore, the vulnerability requires first compromising a service that can call the driver.",
      "Local access to the device is needed."
