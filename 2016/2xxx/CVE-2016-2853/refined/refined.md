      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the fact that when mounting a FUSE filesystem in a user namespace and exposing a SUID binary via aufs, the SUID bit is not dropped. This allows for privilege escalation when the SUID binary is executed from outside of the user namespace.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Loss of nosuid property when using FUSE filesystems with aufs in user namespaces",
          "SUID bit not being dropped when exposed through aufs"

        "impact": "Privilege escalation, potentially leading to root access.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Mount a FUSE filesystem exposing a crafted SUID binary.",

        "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "Due to inheritance of Posix ACL information (xattrs) when aufs is copying files and not cleaning those additional and unintended ACL attributes, SGID directories may become user writable. This allows to gain privileges of the affected group using methods described in  [0]",

           "Find suitable SGID directories with `find / -perm -02020`.",
