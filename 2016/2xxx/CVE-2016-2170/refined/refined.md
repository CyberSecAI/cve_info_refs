Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of vulnerable versions of the Apache Commons Collections library. Specifically, it's related to unsafe deserialization of Java objects. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution when an attacker can control the serialized data being passed to the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is the unsafe deserialization of Java objects, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Dependency on vulnerable library:** The Apache OFBiz application relied on a vulnerable version of Apache Commons Collections library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Apache OFBiz. This could lead to full system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Exploiting Deserialization:** An attacker crafts malicious serialized Java objects and sends them to the OFBiz application, which then deserializes them, leading to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Send Malicious Serialized Objects:** An attacker needs to be able to send malicious serialized Java objects to the vulnerable application. This can be achieved through various means, such as:
   -  HTTP requests (if the application deserializes data from requests).

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Affected OFBiz Versions:** The vulnerability affected multiple OFBiz release branches including 12.04, 13.07, 14.12, and Trunk.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by updating the Apache Commons Collections library to version 3.2.2 in multiple releases.
- **Workarounds:**  A temporary workaround was adopted for Groovy, another library affected by the same vulnerability, until it could be updated, and is no longer necessary in newer versions. The project also implemented a whitelist/blacklist approach to protect against serialization vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation:** The content mentions the use of `notsoserial` to help protect against serialization vulnerabilities by using a whitelist and a deny list
- **Ongoing Issue:**  The content also mentions the need to maintain a list of allowed objects for ObjectInputStream and provides instructions for doing so, to ensure continued protection.
- **RMI and other risks:** The content specifies RMI, JNDI, JMX or Spring as other potential risks

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing context on how the vulnerability was addressed within the OFBiz project and offering workarounds.
