Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling a phpMyAdmin script in an unexpected way, specifically related to the SQL parser. This leads to a PHP error message being displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the full server path of the phpMyAdmin installation. This occurs because the PHP error message reveals the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed.
- **Improper Error Handling:** The underlying issue is that phpMyAdmin's error handling mechanism, under specific invocation conditions, exposes sensitive path information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can learn the full path to the phpMyAdmin installation on the server.
- **Low Severity:**  The vulnerability is categorized as non-critical as it only reveals path information, which, by itself, does not directly lead to compromise. However, this information could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to stage a further attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an "unexpected" invocation of a script that is part of phpMyAdmin, related to the SQL parser. This suggests an attack vector involving manipulated input or crafted requests that cause the script to be executed in a way it was not designed for.
- The vulnerability requires the PHP configuration directive `display_errors` to be set to "on", which is not recommended for production environments. This suggests the vulnerability is exploitable on misconfigured servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send requests to a vulnerable phpMyAdmin installation.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have special privileges.
- An attacker can be remote since this is an HTTP based vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content contains a commit that patches the issue by adding a check for the existence of a specific file before including it, and dies with "Invalid invocation" if the file does not exist. This prevents the PHP error from being displayed in cases of invalid invocation.
- The vulnerability was present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.5.x prior to 4.5.4.
- The vulnerability was reported by Emanuel Bronshtein (@e3amn2l).
- The vulnerability is also classified as CWE-661 and CWE-200.
