  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2016-2809",
    "description": "The Mozilla Maintenance Service updater in Mozilla Firefox before 46.0 on Windows allows user-assisted remote attackers to delete arbitrary files by leveraging certain local file execution.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Mozilla Maintenance Service updater"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Mozilla Maintenance Service updater on Windows can delete arbitrary files because of its privileged system access. The root cause is a path truncation vulnerability. When logging updates, paths are truncated using `snprintf` to fit within a `MAXPATH` length buffer. This truncation allows for the deletion of arbitrary files if a crafted path is provided as a log file argument, enabling out-of-bounds write.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation allowing path truncation.",
      "Use of a fixed-size buffer for paths leading to out-of-bounds write.",
      "Privileged access by the maintenance service, which can be abused by crafted paths."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file deletion, potentially leading to privilege escalation if used to delete files required by privileged processes.",
    "attack_vector": "Local file execution of the maintenance service updater with a crafted file path argument.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute a local file with specific arguments, which implies some level of access to the system."
