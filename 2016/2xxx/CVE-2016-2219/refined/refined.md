Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-provided data within the web interface of the affected product. This means that data entered by a user is stored without proper filtering or encoding, which is a classic cause for XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An authenticated administrator could be tricked into injecting malicious JavaScript.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary script execution within the context of the administrator's session, potentially leading to:
    *   Manipulation of the web interface
    *   Theft of sensitive data or session cookies
    *   Further attacks on the affected system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based attack:** The attack is conducted over the network via the web interface.
*   **User interaction required:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator to execute the malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have an account with administrator level privileges to interact with the affected functionality.
*   **Social Engineering or Phishing:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into loading a crafted URL or manipulate web forms, which injects malicious Javascript into the vulnerable web application.
*   **Network access to the web interface:** The attacker must be able to reach the device's web management interface.

**Additional details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** PAN-OS versions 7.0.1 through 7.0.7 are vulnerable.
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is addressed in PAN-OS version 7.0.8 and later.
*   **Workarounds:** Palo Alto recommends restricting management access to a limited set of IPs and dedicating management of the device to the management interface only.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a base score of 5.4. (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
