- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the web UI, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the web UI that could alter the intended functionality of the application, potentially leading to the disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the web UI by embedding malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the web UI of the affected IBM Rational products and inject malicious JavaScript. This likely requires a user account, and the attacker needs to be in a position where they can inject the script such as a text field or similar input.
