# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201604-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.0-r2** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Local users within a guest QEMU environment can execute arbitrary code
within the host or a cause a Denial of Service condition of the QEMU
guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.5.0-r2"

```

This is fine for now as it protects us against doing something stupid in
a mechanical fashion, but I still wonder under which case we are
"starting" the FIS or CLB engines without getting a valid address. (The
unmap should only be happening when we /stop/ the engines, which implies
they were started -- which points to a bug somewhere else, too.)

Do you have a reproducer for the original issue?
