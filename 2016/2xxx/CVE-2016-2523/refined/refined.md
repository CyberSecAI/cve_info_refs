  "description": "The dnp3_al_process_object function in epan/dissectors/packet-dnp.c in the DNP3 dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.10 and 2.0.x before 2.0.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted packet.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.10",
    "Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The DNP3 dissector could go into an infinite loop due to a crafted packet.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Infinite loop in DNP3 dissector."
  ],
  "impact": "A malformed packet can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire.",
    "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject a malformed packet into network traffic that Wireshark is analyzing or provide a malformed capture file to a user.",
