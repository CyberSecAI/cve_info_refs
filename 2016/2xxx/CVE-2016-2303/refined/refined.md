- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IntegraXor HMI does not neutralize special elements in inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers, leading to HTTP Response Splitting.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject arbitrary headers into the HTTP response.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks. Specifically, sending crafted inputs to the HMI that contains CRLF sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker, no authentication required.
