- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability occurs in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware GUI where an authenticated user can execute GUI functions that require Tivoli Storage Manager administrative credentials, even without possessing those credentials. This happens when TSM administrative ID credentials are not stored in the DP for VMware GUI configuration for all users.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper access control: Authenticated users can bypass authorization checks to execute administrative functions.
    - Privilege escalation: Users without TSM admin privileges can perform actions that require them.
    - Lack of proper session management: When multiple users are logged into the DP for VMware GUI simultaneously, there is a potential for a user to execute functions using another user's cached permissions.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can perform administrative tasks on the TSM server, including backup scheduling and configuration changes. This could lead to data loss, service disruption, or unauthorized access to data.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the Data Protection for VMware GUI. An authenticated user with limited privileges can leverage the vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have a valid user account with access to the DP for VMware GUI.
    - The TSM administrative ID credentials must not be stored in the DP for VMware GUI for use by all users.
    - Multiple users need to be logged into the DP for VMware GUI simultaneously.
    - The attacker must be willing to perform a malicious action.
