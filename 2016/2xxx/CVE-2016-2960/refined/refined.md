- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the handling of specially crafted SIP messages within IBM WebSphere Application Server when using SIP services.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) issue caused by improper processing of specific SIP messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service, impacting the availability of the application server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, exploiting the SIP services functionality by sending specially crafted SIP messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted SIP messages to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server. No authentication is required (PR:N) , low impact on confidentiality and integrity (C:N/I:N).
