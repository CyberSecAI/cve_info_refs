{
  "CVE-2016-2085": {
    "Description": "The evm_verify_hmac function in security/integrity/evm/evm_main.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5 does not properly copy data, which makes it easier for local users to forge MAC values via a timing side-channel attack.",
    "Root cause": "The vm_verify_hmac() function includes a use of memcmp(), which allows timing side channel attacks because memcmp() will exit as soon as a mismatch is found, making the timing dependent on how much of the digest matched prior to the difference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing side channel vulnerability",
      "Use of memcmp() for cryptographic digest comparison."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could forge Message Authentication Code (MAC) values, thereby affecting system integrity. Specifically, the MAC forgery complexity could drop from 2^128 to 2^12.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local user.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user with the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path (Extended Verification Module (EVM)) in the kernel.",
       "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability was fixed by replacing memcmp() with crypto_memneq(), which performs the comparison in constant time.",
        "This vulnerability affects Linux kernels before version 4.5."
      ]
