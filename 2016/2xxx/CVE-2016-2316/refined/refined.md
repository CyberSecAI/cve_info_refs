Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2316:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `chan_sip` module of Asterisk. Specifically, setting the `timert1` value in the `sip.conf` file to a value greater than 1245 can cause an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow when calculating retransmission timeout values. This overflow leads to very large timeout values.
*   **File Descriptor Exhaustion:** The large timeout values cause system file descriptors to be held hostage, leading to a potential exhaustion of file descriptors.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition by exhausting system file descriptors, making the Asterisk server unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Sessions:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely without requiring authentication. An attacker can send SIP requests to manipulate the retransmission timeout.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send SIP traffic to an Asterisk server and manipulate the retransmission timer value to exploit the overflow, requiring network access to the server. They don't need any authentication.

**Additional details:**

*   The default value for `timert1` is 500, which is safe.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Asterisk 1.8.x, 11.x, 12.x, and 13.x, as well as their certified counterparts, prior to the corrected versions.
*   The issue was reported on September 17, 2015 by Alexander Traud and fixed on February 3, 2016.
*   Asterisk has been patched to detect the integer overflow and calculate the previous retransmission timer value.
*   Patches are available for various Asterisk versions.
