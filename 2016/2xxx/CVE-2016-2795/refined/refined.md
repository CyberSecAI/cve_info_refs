Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-2795:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `graphite2::FileFace::get_table_fn` function in the Graphite 2 library. This function does not initialize the memory for an unspecified data structure.
*   This lack of initialization leads to the use of uninitialized memory when the function is called.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Use of Uninitialized Memory**: The core issue is that a memory region is used without being properly initialized first, which could lead to unexpected data or values being accessed.

**3. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted Graphite font that triggers the uninitialized memory usage. This may lead to a denial of service due to application crash.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: There is also the possibility of unspecified other impacts, including arbitrary code execution. This is because the uninitialized memory can end up being used in calls to `malloc()`, `fread()`, and `fseek()`, which can be manipulated.
*   **Unspecified other impact**: The official description also includes an undefined "other impact" which can lead to multiple forms of code execution and denial of service.

**4. Attack Vectors**

*   **Network**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by tricking a user into opening a malicious website that loads the crafted font or opening a malicious email with a crafted font embedded, leveraging the network.
*   **Malicious Font**: The primary attack vector is a crafted Graphite smart font that triggers the vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Remote Position**: The attacker can be remote, exploiting the vulnerability over a network.
*   **User Interaction**: Successful exploitation often requires some user interaction, such as visiting a malicious webpage loading the crafted font or opening a malicious email with an embedded font.
*   **Crafted Font**: The attacker needs the ability to create or obtain a specially crafted Graphite smart font.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Products**: This vulnerability affects software using the Graphite 2 library, including Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and potentially other applications using the library.
*  **Versions**: Graphite 2 versions before 1.3.6 were vulnerable. Patches released for Firefox were around 38.7.0 ESR and 45.0.
*  **Specific call stack:** The specific issue is related to `graphite2::FileFace::get_table_fn`.
*   **Mitigation**: Disabling the graphite font shaping library mitigates the risk. Upgrading to Graphite 2 1.3.6 or later fixes the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The CVSS v2 base score is 6.8. The CVSS v3 base score is 8.8 indicating a high impact.
*  **Gentoo GLSA:** The Gentoo Security Advisory references that a remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information and that this issue was exploitable remotely.
*  **SUSE:** SUSE has marked the vulnerability as "important" with a remote exploit via a network and partial to complete impact of the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

In summary, CVE-2016-2795 is a use-of-uninitialized-memory vulnerability in the Graphite 2 library, which can be triggered by a crafted font, leading to potential DoS or arbitrary code execution when the crafted font is loaded via software using the library like Firefox or Thunderbird. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the network and requires a user interaction.
