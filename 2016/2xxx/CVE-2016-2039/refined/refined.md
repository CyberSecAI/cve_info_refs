  "CVE-2016-2039": {
    "description": "libraries/session.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.13, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.3, and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 does not properly generate CSRF token values, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by predicting a value.",
    "root_cause": "The CSRF token was generated using a weak algorithm, specifically `md5(uniqid(rand(), true))`, which does not produce cryptographically secure random values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of non-cryptographically secure random number generator for CSRF token generation",
      "Predictable CSRF token values"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass intended access restrictions by predicting the CSRF token value.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the phpMyAdmin instance.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was fixed by using `phpseclib\\Crypt\\Random::string(16)` to generate CSRF tokens, which relies on PHP 7.0 random_bytes or openssl_random_pseudo_bytes where available to produce cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes. Versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.13), 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.15.3) and 4.5.x (prior to 4.5.4) are affected."
