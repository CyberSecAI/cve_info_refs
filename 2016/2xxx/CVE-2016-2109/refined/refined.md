Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-2109:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `asn1_d2i_read_bio` function within the ASN.1 BIO implementation of OpenSSL. This function, used for reading ASN.1 data from a BIO structure, doesn't properly handle short or invalid encodings, leading to excessive memory allocation. Specifically, it is triggered when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO (e.g. d2i_CMS_bio()), a short invalid encoding can cause allocation of large amounts of memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Excessive memory allocation:** The core weakness is an excessive memory allocation issue that can be triggered by a short invalid encoding.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The underlying cause is a lack of proper input validation in the `asn1_d2i_read_bio` function when handling ASN.1 data read from a BIO.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition due to excessive memory consumption or memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker sending a short invalid encoding.
*   **Network**:  The attacker needs to be able to send malicious data through the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to send crafted ASN.1 data:** Attackers must be able to send specially crafted, short, invalid ASN.1 encoded data to the vulnerable server.
*   **Network accessibility to the target:** The attacker needs to be able to send this data to a server or application that uses the vulnerable version of OpenSSL to process BIO data structures.
