Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2355:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the dotCMS Content REST API. This vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `stName` parameter, submitted via a POST request, was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `stName` parameter in the REST API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** An attacker could compromise the integrity of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/content/save/1` endpoint, containing malicious SQL code within the `stName` parameter.
*   **REST API:** The vulnerability lies within the Content REST API of dotCMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the dotCMS instance.
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable REST endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Required (Default):** The vulnerability could be exploited anonymously in the default configuration of dotCMS, which allowed anonymous content saving via the API.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided github issue #8848 shows a number of test payloads that exploit this SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The dotCMS security advisory indicates that the issue was discovered by Nicky from Tencent Security Platform Department.
*   The advisory indicates the issue is critical and affects versions prior to 3.3.2 and 3.5.
*   Mitigation includes denying access to /api endpoints to anonymous/off network traffic and setting the `REST_API_REJECT_WITH_NO_USER=true` property.
