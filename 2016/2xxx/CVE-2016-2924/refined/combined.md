1. Stop the Dataserver Manager server (DSM) from the Ambari web interface.

2. Backup the DSM meta data:

<DSM\_OLD\_VERSION\_INSTALL\_PATH>/Config/default\_rep\_db

<DSM\_OLD\_VERSION\_INSTALL\_PATH>/Config/privileges.json

For example:

/usr/ibmpacks/IBM-DSM/2.1.0.0/ibm-datasrvrmgr/Config/default\_rep\_db

/usr/ibmpacks/IBM-DSM/2.1.0.0/ibm-datasrvrmgr/Config/privileges.json

3. Install DSM V2.1.2

3a) Install from package repository:

yum list IBM-DSM

You  might see the following in the list: IBM-DSM.noarch 2.1.2-0

Install the DSM V2.1.2:

yum install IBM-DSM-2.1.2-0.

3b) Install with rpm command,

rpm -ivh dsm-2.1.2.0-N20161209\_1110.noarch.rpm

4. Make DSM V2.1.2  the current version:

cd /usr/ibmpacks/current

rm IBM-DSM

ln -s /usr/ibmpacks/IBM-DSM/2.1.2.0 IBM-DSM

chown -R dsmuser:hadoop /usr/ibmpacks/IBM-DSM/2.1.2.0

chmod 755 /usr/ibmpacks/IBM-DSM/2.1.2.0/ibm-datasrvrmgr/bin/heartbeat.sh

5. Restore the backup files by restoring  the default\_rep\_db folder and privileges.json file back to the DSM V2.1.2 installation path.

6. Start the Data Server Manager version 2.1.2 service from the Ambari web interface.

7. Verify the DSM V2.1.2 status in the Ambari web interface.
