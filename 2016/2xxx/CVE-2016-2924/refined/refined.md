- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in Data Server Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) in the IBM InfoSphere BigInsights Web console. The vulnerability is related to user-supplied input and how it's handled by the Data Server Manager.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web console which can be executed in the context of another user's browser session when they view the affected pages. This could lead to stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through user-supplied input into the Data Server Manager, which is then rendered through the BigInsights Web console, without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input into the Data Server Manager and have that input rendered through the vulnerable web console to be able to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
