    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application stores the Active Directory (AD) password in an encrypted form. The encryption key and algorithm are hardcoded within the application.  By reversing the application's code, the encryption algorithm is obtained.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded encryption key and algorithm. The application does not properly protect the stored AD credentials.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with read access to the Symantec Brightmail gateway can recover the AD account password, which could lead to unauthorized access to the AD domain and/or related resources.",
        "Attack vectors": "Web interface of Symantec Brightmail Gateway.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs read access to the Symantec Brightmail gateway's web interface. This can be achieved with valid login credentials for the application."
