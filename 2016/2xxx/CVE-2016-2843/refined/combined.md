## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

It was discovered that the ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild function in

Blink mishandled widget updates in some circumstances. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1630](/security/CVE-2016-1630))

It was discovered that the PPB\_Flash\_MessageLoop\_Impl::InternalRun

function in Chromium mishandled nested message loops. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1631](/security/CVE-2016-1631))

Multiple use-after-frees were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

([CVE-2016-1633](/security/CVE-2016-1633), [CVE-2016-1634](/security/CVE-2016-1634), [CVE-2016-1644](/security/CVE-2016-1644))

It was discovered that the PendingScript::notifyFinished function in

Blink relied on memory-cache information about integrity-check occurrences

instead of integrity-check successes. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass Subresource Integrity (SRI) protections. ([CVE-2016-1636](/security/CVE-2016-1636))

It was discovered that the SkATan2\_255 function in Skia mishandled

arctangent calculations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-1637](/security/CVE-2016-1637))

A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2016-1641](/security/CVE-2016-1641))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1642](/security/CVE-2016-1642))

A type-confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in

to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

([CVE-2016-1643](/security/CVE-2016-1643))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-2843](/security/CVE-2016-2843))

An invalid cast was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-2844](/security/CVE-2016-2844))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in

Blink did not ignore a URL's path component in the case of a ServiceWorker

fetch. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2016-2845](/security/CVE-2016-2845))

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, March 2, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 49 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Chrome 49.0.2623.75 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/48.0.2564.116..49.0.2623.75?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 49.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [26 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M48&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. An additional $14,500 in rewards were issued for security bugs present on non-stable channels.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[591402](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=591402)] CVE-2016-1642: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.9 branch (currently 4.9.385.26).

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
