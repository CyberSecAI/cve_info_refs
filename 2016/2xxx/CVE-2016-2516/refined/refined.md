  "description": "Yihan Lian discovered that duplicate IPs on \"unconfig\" directives will trigger an assert.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ntpd daemon will abort when it processes an unconfig directive with duplicate IPs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Assertion Failure"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to ntpd process termination.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"

     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send configuration commands to the ntpd daemon. This requires knowledge of the `controlkey` for `ntpq` or the `requestkey` for `ntpdc` if mode7 is expressly enabled, indicating a privileged attacker role or compromised credentials."
