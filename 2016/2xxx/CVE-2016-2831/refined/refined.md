Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-2831:

**CVE-2016-2831**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles requests for fullscreen and pointer lock. Specifically, it fails to ensure that a user explicitly approves these requests when triggered in combination with closing browser windows which leads to permission bypass.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Permission Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the user's permission prompt for pointer lock when a full-screen request is immediately followed by a pointer lock request. This means a malicious webpage could gain pointer lock access without the user's explicit consent.
    *   **Persistent Pointer Lock:** Once pointer lock is activated using the vulnerable sequence, it remains active even after the window is closed. This leads to the mouse cursor being locked in the center of other browser windows and can't be released using the escape key.
    *  **Clickjacking and Spoofing:**  The lack of proper user consent verification for pointer lock in fullscreen mode could allow an attacker to trick the user into interacting with a malicious element in the full screen by spoofing UI elements.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The persistent pointer lock makes the browser unusable since the mouse pointer remains fixed, preventing users from interacting with anything. This requires killing the browser process to regain control.
    *   **Clickjacking:** By locking the mouse cursor, an attacker can position the locked mouse cursor over areas of a newly opened window that are used to prompt for various permissions, giving a high likelihood that the user will unwittingly click the permission grant button and allow access to sensitive resources, such as the camera or microphone.
    * **Address bar spoofing:** The vulnerability can allow an attacker to manipulate UI elements leading the user to believe they are on a trusted page.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious website contains Javascript to trigger the vulnerable sequence of `mozRequestFullScreen` followed by `mozRequestPointerLock` (or vice versa) and then closes the window.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  Attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website with malicious JavaScript to trigger the vulnerable behavior.
    *  The attacker must trick a user to visit this page using social engineering or similar tactics to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional notes from the analysis:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Firefox versions including ESR versions, which are used in some enterprise environments. This indicates the potential for wide-ranging impact.
*   Patches were quickly released by Mozilla to address the issue.
*   Some discussion occurred regarding static vs dynamic linking of the related cryptographic library (libfreebl3) during patching, but it was resolved to use a shared library approach.
