Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-2359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Milesight IP cameras do not properly authenticate commands submitted to the `cgi-bin` interface. Specifically, the `vb.htm` file allows control of various camera functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insufficient Authentication:** The camera's CGI interface has a flaw where it checks privileges based on the *least* privileged action within a set of simultaneously submitted actions. This means an unprivileged action can be paired with a privileged action to bypass access control.
-   **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The vulnerability allows for the submission of two actions at the same time, where one requires no privileges, and the other is privileged. The system only checks the privileges for the unprivileged command, and then executes both, effectively bypassing access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Full Control:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to camera functions, such as zooming, adding/deleting users, and rebooting the system, which they would normally not have access to.
-   **Complete takeover:** By exploiting this vulnerability, it allows the attacker to execute privileged commands without proper authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network access**: Exploitation occurs through network requests to the camera's web interface, specifically the `cgi-bin` with a crafted request to `vb.htm`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable camera.
-   **HTTP interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with specially crafted parameters to the `cgi-bin`.
