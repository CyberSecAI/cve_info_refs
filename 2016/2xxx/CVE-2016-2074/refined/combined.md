## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1318553#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-17 08:45:34 UTC  ``` Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to remote buffer overflow attacks, in which crafted MPLS packets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an OVS internal data structure. The MPLS packets that trigger the vulnerability and the potential for exploitation vary depending on version:      - Open vSwitch 2.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.      - In Open vSwitch 2.2.x and 2.3.x, the MPLS buffer overflow can be       exploited for arbitrary remote code execution.      - In Open vSwitch 2.4.x, the MPLS buffer overflow does not       obviously lead to a remote code execution exploit, but testing       shows that it can allow a remote denial of service.      - Open vSwitch 2.5.x is not vulnerable.  Mitigation ==========  For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing MPLS packets from reaching Open vSwitch mitigates the vulnerability.  We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability this way because of the following difficulties:      - Open vSwitch obtains packets before the iptables host firewall,       so iptables on the Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the       vulnerability.      - If Open vSwitch is configured to support tunnels, MPLS packets       encapsulated within tunnels must also be prevented from reaching       the host.      - If Open vSwitch runs on a hypervisor, MPLS packets from VMs can       also trigger the vulnerability.  We believe that Open vSwitch 2.4 is subject to denial of service only when debug logging is enabled.  By default, debug logging is not enabled.  Users most commonly enable debug logging at runtime using the "ovs-appctl" utility.  When this is the case, the buffer overflow will crash the ovs-vswitchd daemon once, and then when it automatically restarts debug logging will be disabled; thus, in this situation, the vulnerability can only cause a single, brief interruption in service.  Debug logging can also be enabled persistently using a command-line flag; in this situation, a stream of crafted MPLS packets could cause an extended denial of service.

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2016-03-16 17:15:14 UTC  ``` Embargo ends: Monday, March 28  Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to remote buffer overflow attacks, in which crafted MPLS packets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an OVS internal data structure. The MPLS packets that trigger the vulnerability and the potential for exploitation vary depending on version:      - Open vSwitch 2.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.      - In Open vSwitch 2.2.x and 2.3.x, the MPLS buffer overflow can be       exploited for arbitrary remote code execution.      - In Open vSwitch 2.4.x, the MPLS buffer overflow does not       obviously lead to a remote code execution exploit, but testing       shows that it can allow a remote denial of service.      - Open vSwitch 2.5.x is not vulnerable.   Mitigation ==========  For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing MPLS packets from reaching Open vSwitch mitigates the vulnerability.  We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability this way because of the following difficulties:      - Open vSwitch obtains packets before the iptables host firewall,       so iptables on the Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the       vulnerability.      - If Open vSwitch is configured to support tunnels, MPLS packets       encapsulated within tunnels must also be prevented from reaching       the host.      - If Open vSwitch runs on a hypervisor, MPLS packets from VMs can       also trigger the vulnerability.  We believe that Open vSwitch 2.4 is subject to denial of service only when debug logging is enabled.  By default, debug logging is not enabled.  Users most commonly enable debug logging at runtime using the "ovs-appctl" utility.  When this is the case, the buffer overflow will crash the ovs-vswitchd daemon once, and then when it automatically restarts debug logging will be disabled; thus, in this situation, the vulnerability can only cause a single, brief interruption in service.  Debug logging can also be enabled persistently using a command-line flag; in this situation, a stream of crafted MPLS packets could cause an extended denial of service.   Fix ===  Patches to fix these vulnerabilities in Open vSwitch 2.3.x and 2.4.x are appended.  The patch for Open vSwitch 2.3.x also applies to and is effective for Open vSwitch 2.2.x.   Recommendation ==============  We recommend that users of Open vSwitch 2.3.x or 2.4.x apply the respective patch, or upgrade to Open vSwitch 2.5.0.  For Open vSwitch 2.4.x only, if it cannot be upgraded expeditiously, we recommend verifying that debug logging is not enabled on the command line.  This is not effective mitigation for Open vSwitch 2.3.x.  Open vSwitch 2.2.x was never officially released.  If users of prerelease versions exist, we recommend that they upgrade to Open vSwitch 2.5.0. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2016-03-16 17:16:52 UTC  ``` As 2.5.0 is in tree, I'd like to do a fast stablereq on that (amd64/x86) and remove all older releases. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2016-03-16 17:35:13 UTC  ``` adding arch sec liaisons for fast stablereq of =net-misc/openvswitch-2.5.0 ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2016-03-16 18:04:13 UTC  ``` stable for both. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2016-03-16 18:10:42 UTC  ``` removed bad versions  openvswitch-2.3.0.ebuild openvswitch-2.3.1.ebuild openvswitch-2.3.2.ebuild openvswitch-2.4.0.ebuild  cleanup done  removing arch contacts ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Kristian Fiskerstrand (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-04-10 16:18:27 UTC  ``` issue public at <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/03/29/1> ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-11-21 17:02:03 UTC  ``` @ Security: Waiting for GLSA... ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2017-01-01 16:03:57 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201701-07 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-07> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=972957#c0)  Victor Pereira   2016-03-29 09:05:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2016-2074  Description ===========  Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to remote buffer overflow attacks, in which crafted MPLS packets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an OVS internal data structure. The MPLS packets that trigger the vulnerability and the potential for exploitation vary depending on version:      - Open vSwitch 2.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.      - In Open vSwitch 2.2.x and 2.3.x, the MPLS buffer overflow can be       exploited for arbitrary remote code execution.      - In Open vSwitch 2.4.x, the MPLS buffer overflow does not       obviously lead to a remote code execution exploit, but testing       shows that it can allow a remote denial of service.  See the       mitigation section for details.      - Open vSwitch 2.5.x is not vulnerable.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-2074 to this issue.   Mitigation ==========  For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing MPLS packets from reaching Open vSwitch mitigates the vulnerability.  We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability this way because of the following difficulties:      - Open vSwitch obtains packets before the iptables host firewall,       so iptables on the Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the       vulnerability.      - If Open vSwitch is configured to support tunnels, MPLS packets       encapsulated within tunnels must also be prevented from reaching       the host.      - If Open vSwitch runs on a hypervisor, MPLS packets from VMs can       also trigger the vulnerability.  We believe that Open vSwitch 2.4 is subject to denial of service only when debug logging is enabled.  By default, debug logging is not enabled.  Users most commonly enable debug logging at runtime using the "ovs-appctl" utility.  When this is the case, the buffer overflow will crash the ovs-vswitchd daemon once, and then when it automatically restarts debug logging will be disabled; thus, in this situation, the vulnerability can only cause a single, brief interruption in service.  Debug logging can also be enabled persistently using a command-line flag; in this situation, a stream of crafted MPLS packets could cause an extended denial of service.   Fix ===  Patches to fix these vulnerabilities in Open vSwitch 2.3.x and 2.4.x are appended.  The patch for Open vSwitch 2.3.x also applies to and is effective for Open vSwitch 2.2.x.   Recommendation ==============  We recommend that users of Open vSwitch 2.3.x or 2.4.x apply the respective patch, or upgrade to Open vSwitch 2.5.0.  For Open vSwitch 2.4.x only, if it cannot be upgraded expeditiously, we recommend verifying that debug logging is not enabled on the command line.  This is not effective mitigation for Open vSwitch 2.3.x.  Open vSwitch 2.2.x was never officially released.  If you use a prerelease version, we recommend that you upgrade to Open vSwitch 2.5.0.   Acknowledgements ================  The Open vSwitch team wishes to thank the reporters: Kashyap Thimmaraju <kashyap.thimmaraju () sec t-labs tu-berlin de> and Bhargava Shastry <bshastry () sec t-labs tu-berlin de>.   Open vSwitch 2.3.x Vulnerability Check ======================================  This procedure can be used to check whether a given copy of Open vSwitch 2.3.x is vulnerable to CVE-2016-2074.  This procedure will crash a vulnerable installation (although in most installations it will automatically restart itself), so do not run the test on a mission-critical production system.  This procedure has been tested with i386 and x86-64 builds of Open vSwitch on GNU/Linux systems.  To test:  1. Start Open vSwitch, if it is not already running.  (If you are    working from an Open vSwitch source tree, as opposed to an    installed copy, you may use the OVS sandbox environment by running    "make sandbox".)  2. Choose some Open vSwitch bridge; which one is not important.  If you    do not know what Open vSwitch bridges exist, run "ovs-vsctl list-br".    If no bridges exist, create one with a command like "ovs-vsctl add-br    br0".  3. Run the following command, substituting the name of your bridge for    br0:         ovs-appctl ofproto/trace br0 in_port=1 ffffffffffff0000000000008847$(for i in $(seq 512); do printf cccc; done)     If Open vSwitch is vulnerable, this command will crash    ovs-vswitchd, and you will see output similar to the following:         2016-03-12T01:34:28Z|00001|unixctl|WARN|error communicating with  unix:/home/blp/nicira/ovs/tutorial/sandbox/ovs-vswitchd.18399.ctl: Unknown error -1        ovs-appctl: ovs-vswitchd: transaction error (End of file)     If OVS is not vulnerable, ovs-vswitchd will not crash.  You will see    output much different from that above, and likely similar to the    following:         Bridge: br0        Flow:  mpls,metadata=0,in_port=1,vlan_tci=0x0000,dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:00,dl_dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff,mpls_label=838860,mpls_tc=6,mpls_ttl=204,mpls_bos=0,mpls_lse1=3435973836,mpls_lse2=3435973836        Rule: table=0 cookie=0 priority=0        OpenFlow actions=NORMAL        no input bundle, dropping         Final flow: unchanged        Megaflow:  recirc_id=0,skb_priority=0,mpls,in_port=1,vlan_tci=0x0000/0x1fff,dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:00,dl_dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff        Datapath actions: drop  4.

Open vSwitch 2.4.x Vulnerability Check ======================================  We have not developed a procedure to check Open vSwitch 2.4.x for this vulnerability.  The procedure described for Open vSwitch 2.3.x is not effective for Open vSwitch 2.4.x.   Open vSwitch 2.2.x and 2.3.x Patch ==================================  From: Ben Pfaff <blp () ovn org> Date: Mon, 7 Mar 2016 15:30:39 -0800 Subject: [PATCH branch-2.3] flow: Fix buffer overflow for crafted MPLS packets.  A bug in MPLS parsing could cause a crafted MPLS packet to overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in the OVS internal flow structure.  This fixes the problem.  This commit also fixes a secondary problem where an MPLS packet with zero labels could cause an out-of-range shift that would overwrite memory. There is no obvious way to control the data used in the overwrite, so this is harder to exploit.

A crafted MPLS packet yields a zero 'count' in this excerpt from miniflow_extract():          count = parse_mpls(&data, &size);         miniflow_push_words_32(mf, mpls_lse, mpls, count);  In turn, miniflow_push_words_32() updated mf.map as follows:      MF.map |= ((UINT64_MAX >> (64 - DIV_ROUND_UP(N_WORDS, 2))) << ofs64);  which expanded to:      mf.map |= (UINT64_MAX >> 64) << ofs64;  Unforunately, C renders shifting a 64-bit constant by 64 bits undefined. On common x86 platforms, 'n << 64' is equal to 'n', so this behaves as:      mf.map |= UINT64_MAX << ofs64;  In this particular case, ofs64 is 15, so this sets the most-significant 48 bits of mf.map (a 63-bit bit-field) to 1.  Only the least-significant 28 bits of mf.map should ever be set to 1, so this sets 35 bits to 1 that should never be.  Because of the structure of the data structure that mf.map is embedded within, this makes it possible later to overwrite 8*35 == 280 bytes of data in the stack.  However, there is no obvious way to control the data used in the overwrite--it is memcpy'd from one place to another but the source data does not come from the network.  In the bug reporter's testing, this overwrite caused a userspace crash if debug logging was enabled, but not otherwise.  This commit fixes the problem by avoiding the out-of-range shift.

In SLE12 and SLE12SP1, we ship OpenvSwitch 2.1.2, which should not be affected. For SLE12SP2 we will ship OpenvSwitch 2.5.0, which is also unaffected.  On the OpenSUSE (OBS)/Cloud side, we have:   1. network/openvswitch - 2.4.0 & 2.5.0     i. 2.4.0 is only used for SLE11 builds - I will add a patch for this.     ii. 2.5.0 is used for every other build.    2. Factory/openvswitch - Currently 2.4.0 only as they've not yet pushed the       latest changes in network/openvswitch. Will ping the maintainer.    3. openSUSE:13.1:Update/openvswitch - Ships 1.11.0 which should not be       affected.    4. openSUSE:13.2 - Package is not available in oss repos.    5. openSUSE:Leap:42.1:Update/openvswitch - Ships 2.3.1 which is an affected      version. Either a patch or a version rev to 2.5.0 is needed.    6. Cloud release repos - I'll speak with the maintainers. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=972957#c3)  Karol Mroz   2016-03-30 11:25:24 UTC  ``` Dirk/Ralf,  This bug does not impact SLES12/SP1/SP2, but more the OpenSUSE side (and I guess Cloud?) of things.  How do you guys feel about revving OpenSUSE:Factory and 42.1 to OpenvSwitch 2.5.0 (what's in network/openvswitch)?  As to Cloud repositories, I think you guys run 2.3.1 which is also impacted. I don't know what the best plan there is... a rev, or backport the included patches? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=972957#c4)  Karol Mroz   2016-04-05 08:55:22 UTC  ``` Update:  network/openvswitch no longer contains builds for 2.4.0. So no worries there.  Factory/openvswitch contains an SR that will update the version to 2.5.0   - <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/382896>  openSUSE:Leap:42.1:Update/openvswitch still contains 2.3.1. We'll want to update this to 2.5.0 along side Factory/openvswitch.   @dirk - Do you think pushing your SR#382896 to Leap would be acceptable?  Cloud Repos apparently use SLE12SP1 version (ie. 2.1.2) and so are not impacted. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=972957#c5)  Ralf Haferkamp   2017-05-11 10:04:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Karol Mroz from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=972957#c3)) > Dirk/Ralf,  > As to Cloud repositories, I think you guys run 2.3.1 which is also impacted.  Sorry for answering this late. This somehow fell through the cracks :(. I don't know if this is still relevant, but AFAICS all our cloud products are either on 2.1.X or 2.5.X meanwhile so I guess we're good there. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=972957#c6)  Dirk Mueller   2017-05-17 09:42:00 UTC  ``` Cloud6/7 use the openvswitch from SLES, which is synced with Leap. I don't see anything left to be done here. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=972957#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2019-07-09 06:12:19 UTC  ``` was fixed by version updates ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1318553#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-03-17 08:45:34 UTC  ``` Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to remote buffer overflow attacks, in which crafted MPLS packets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an OVS internal data structure. The MPLS packets that trigger the vulnerability and the potential for exploitation vary depending on version:      - Open vSwitch 2.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.      - In Open vSwitch 2.2.x and 2.3.x, the MPLS buffer overflow can be       exploited for arbitrary remote code execution.      - In Open vSwitch 2.4.x, the MPLS buffer overflow does not       obviously lead to a remote code execution exploit, but testing       shows that it can allow a remote denial of service.      - Open vSwitch 2.5.x is not vulnerable.  Mitigation ==========  For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing MPLS packets from reaching Open vSwitch mitigates the vulnerability.  We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability this way because of the following difficulties:      - Open vSwitch obtains packets before the iptables host firewall,       so iptables on the Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the       vulnerability.      - If Open vSwitch is configured to support tunnels, MPLS packets       encapsulated within tunnels must also be prevented from reaching       the host.      - If Open vSwitch runs on a hypervisor, MPLS packets from VMs can       also trigger the vulnerability.  We believe that Open vSwitch 2.4 is subject to denial of service only when debug logging is enabled.  By default, debug logging is not enabled.  Users most commonly enable debug logging at runtime using the "ovs-appctl" utility.  When this is the case, the buffer overflow will crash the ovs-vswitchd daemon once, and then when it automatically restarts debug logging will be disabled; thus, in this situation, the vulnerability can only cause a single, brief interruption in service.  Debug logging can also be enabled persistently using a command-line flag; in this situation, a stream of crafted MPLS packets could cause an extended denial of service.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Synopsis

Important: openvswitch security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0523)

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

Security Fix(es):

* A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the OVS processing of MPLS labels. A remote attacker able to deliver a frame containing a malicious MPLS label that would be processed by OVS could trigger the flaw and use the resulting memory corruption to cause a denial of service (DoS) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2074)

Red Hat would like to thank the Open vSwitch project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Kashyap Thimmaraju and Bhargava Shastry as the original reporters.

## Solution

Package        : openvswitch
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2074

Kashyap Thimmaraju and Bhargava Shastry discovered a remotely
triggerable buffer overflow vulnerability in openvswitch, a production
quality, multilayer virtual switch implementation. Specially crafted
MPLS packets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an
OVS internal data structure. A remote attacker can take advantage of
this flaw to cause a denial of service, or potentially, execution of
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0+git20140819-3+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0+git20140819-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your openvswitch packages.

## Topic

Updated openvswitch packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private
cloud deployments.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the OVS processing of MPLS labels.
A remote attacker able to deliver a frame containing a malicious MPLS label
that would be processed by OVS could trigger the flaw and use the resulting
memory corruption to cause a denial of service (DoS) or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2074)

Red Hat would like to thank the Open vSwitch Project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Kashyap Thimmaraju and Bhargava Shastry as
the original reporters of CVE-2016-2074.

This update includes the following images:

openshift3/openvswitch:v3.1.1.6-9
aep3\_beta/openvswitch:v3.1.1.6-9
openshift3/node:v3.1.1.6-16
aep3\_beta/node:v3.1.1.6-16

All openvswitch users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
