Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `org.springframework.core.serializer.DefaultDeserializer` class within Spring AMQP. This class deserializes objects without validating them against a whitelist, which makes it vulnerable to attacks using crafted serialized objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of validation during deserialization. The `DefaultDeserializer` doesn't check the classes or packages of the objects it's deserializing.
- **Use of `ObjectInputStream`:** The `SimpleMessageConverter` also uses `ObjectInputStream` internally, without proper validation by default, making it vulnerable too.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By providing a specially crafted serialized object (like the "Commons Collection gadget"), an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Serialized Objects:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted serialized Java object through a message queue consumed by a Spring AMQP application configured to use `DefaultDeserializer` or `SimpleMessageConverter`.
- **Untrusted Data Sources:** The primary attack vector involves receiving untrusted data that is then deserialized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Messages:** An attacker needs to be able to send messages to the RabbitMQ queue that the vulnerable application is listening to.
- **Knowledge of Deserialization Gadgets:**  The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious serialized object that triggers code execution, for example, using known gadgets like the Commons Collections gadget.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Spring AMQP versions 1.0.0 to 1.5.4.
- Spring AMQP 1.5.5 introduced a configuration option to whitelist acceptable packages/classes for deserialization.
- The `SimpleMessageConverter` can also be configured with a whitelist to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The `DefaultDeserializer` is not automatically registered in a Spring Application context by default. It needs to be explicitly used, so developers should be cautious about using it when handling untrusted data.
- It is recommended not to use Java serialization in environments that handle untrusted data. If it must be used, a whitelist should always be configured.
