# CVE-2016-2173 Remote Code Execution in Spring AMQP

CRITICAL | APRIL 11, 2016 | CVE-2016-2173
# Description

The class org.springframework.core.serializer.DefaultDeserializer does not validate the deserialized object against a whitelist. By supplying a crafted serialized object like Chris Frohoff's Commons Collection gadget, remote code execution can be achieved.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* 1.0.0 to 1.5.4

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* The cited class (DefaultDeserializer) is not registered by any Spring application context automatically; users should take care when using this class with objects from untrusted sources in the same way they should when using ObjectInputStream directly.
* Spring AMQP has an (optional) message converter that can use this deserializer; starting with version 1.5.5, that converter can now be configured with a whitelist of acceptable packages/classes that can be deserialized.
* Spring AMQP also has a SimpleMessageConverter which \*is\* configured by default; it doesn't use the deserializer, but does use ObjectInputStream internally; it, too, can now be configured with a whitelist of packages/classes.
* It is recommended that users do not use Java serialization when using RabbitMQ in an environment where untrusted data might be received; if they do, they should configure the converter with the allowable objects.
* Users that might be exposed to this vulnerability should upgrade to Spring AMQP 1.5.5 or higher and configure the whitelist.
