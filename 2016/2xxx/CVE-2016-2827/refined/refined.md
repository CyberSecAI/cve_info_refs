  "cve": "CVE-2016-2827",
  "description": "The provided content describes an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the mozilla::net::IsValidReferrerPolicy function within Mozilla Firefox. This occurs when a Content Security Policy (CSP) contains a `referrer` directive without any valid source values. This vulnerability can lead to a crash.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Firefox versions prior to 49"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the CSP parser's failure to properly handle a 'referrer' directive without any associated source values. Specifically, the code attempts to access an element in an array using an invalid index, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read in mozilla::net::IsValidReferrerPolicy.",
  "impact": "The primary impact is a non-exploitable crash. While the out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to further memory corruption, the specific case outlined in the bug report and analysis suggests that this is unlikely.",
  "attack_vectors": "A malicious web page can trigger the vulnerability by sending a Content Security Policy (CSP) header that includes a `referrer` directive without specifying any valid source values.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to serve a malicious web page, either through a compromised website or a phishing campaign.",
  "additional_details": [
    "The vulnerability is located in the Content Security Policy (CSP) parsing logic.",
    "The issue occurs when the 'referrer' directive is present, but without any source values (e.g. 'referrer').",
    "The vulnerability was introduced when implementing the CSP 1.1 referrer directive.",
    "A patch was developed to check for this condition, preventing the out-of-bounds read.",
     "The fix involves checking if there are no valid sources before attempting to access the array element.",
    "The issue was initially categorized as a memory corruption but is clarified as a read out of bounds.",
    "The severity is rated as 'low', since the crash is not exploitable"
