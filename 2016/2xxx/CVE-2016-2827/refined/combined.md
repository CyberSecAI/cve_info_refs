This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug.

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

In this case where a CSP of 'referrer' is delivered without any valid srcs (e.g. it's not delivered like 'referrer no-referrer') our parser is reading a bogus value and tries to convert that value into a valid referrerPolicy.
If you run the test in a debug build you actually trigger an assertion (see underneath). Nevertheless, it's not handled gracefully within the CSP parser.

The problem was introduced within
> [Bug 965727](/show_bug.cgi?id=965727 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement CSP 1.1 referrer directive") - Implement referrer directive for CSP. (r=jst,ckerschb)
[Bug 965727](/show_bug.cgi?id=965727 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement CSP 1.1 referrer directive") checks that the referrer directive does not contain too many srcs but doesn't check if there are not enough [1] - really unfortunate!
While investigating the problem related to this bug I also realized that we don't handle 'sandbox', 'report-uri' and also 'require-sri' directives correctly if delivered without a src. In those cases it's not a memory-corruption problem though, because the parser iterates over the remaining srcs instead of indexing into the array (see [2] for example). I filed [Bug 1290560](/show_bug.cgi?id=1290560 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update CSPParser to handle 'sandbox', 'require-sri' and 'report-uri' with no valid srcs correctly") to fix those problems, no need to pollute this patch with those fixes. Also because this patch most likely will be upliftet.

This doesn't seem particularly exploitable: either it will crash the user or the referrer policy will be invalid and ignored. In rare cases it might match a valid value and change the type of referrer that gets sent.Blocks: [965727](/show_bug.cgi?id=965727 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement CSP 1.1 referrer directive")

I notice that in nsCSPParser::requireSRIForDirectiveValue() the error case does not delete aDir. I think you're right here and we have a leak in the other one so maybe you can fix that in this patch.

casting to a nsRequireSRIForDirective\* can't be right. The method's argument is a nsCSPDirective\* and cspDir is already a nsCSPDirective\* so I don't think you need the cast, do you?

Yes, there is a leak. I'll fix that within [Bug 1290560](/show_bug.cgi?id=1290560 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update CSPParser to handle 'sandbox', 'require-sri' and 'report-uri' with no valid srcs correctly") as well, since requrire-sri is prefed off by default anyway.

You are absolutely right, no need for that cast. That was a copy/paste. Thanks for catching.

bug\_1289085\_csp\_referrer\_directive\_with\_no\_valid\_src\_tests.patch
Approval Request Comment
A webpage sending the CSP policy of only 'referrer' (without any src after the directive) might crash the browser because Firefox is reading a value from out of bounds.
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
[Bug 965727](/show_bug.cgi?id=965727 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement CSP 1.1 referrer directive") - Implement CSP 1.1 referrer directive
[User impact if declined]:
I don't know how many sites would send a CSP policy of 'referrer' only, but the fact that a security feature might crash the browser makes me feel we should uplift the fix within this bug.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
Landed a compiled code test within this bug.
[Risks and why]:
Low, because the change only affects the CSP parser.
[String/UUID change made/needed]:
no

privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition via
multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-45.6.0"

```

All Firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-45.6.0"

```

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-45.6.0"

```

All Thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-45.6.0"

```

An attacker who was able to get a mis-issued certificate for a Mozilla web site could send malicious add-on updates to users on networks controlled by the attacker. Users who have not installed any add-ons are not affected.
