Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Samba initiates signed DCE/RPC connections. Specifically, a man-in-the-middle attacker can inject either `SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_GUEST` or `SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_NULL` flags during connection establishment. This manipulation downgrades the connection, effectively disabling the required signing that should protect the communication, allowing the attacker to impersonate a server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Downgrade Attack:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to a downgrade attack on SMB2/3 connections.
*   **Missing Signing Enforcement:** Although "client ipc signing" and "client ipc max protocol" settings were meant to enforce signing, the vulnerability makes it possible to bypass them, allowing attackers to remove the signing enforcement from the connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Server Impersonation:** A successful attack enables the attacker to impersonate a legitimate server, leading to the possibility of returning malicious results to clients. This is especially critical for services such as `winbindd` which relies on secure DCERPC over SMB2 for communication with domain controllers.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** In some scenarios, exploiting this vulnerability could potentially allow for arbitrary remote code execution, especially if the attacker can manipulate the results of DCE/RPC calls.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially intercept data exchanged over the downgraded connection.
*    **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:**  The attacker can conduct man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks due to the lack of signing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between a Samba client and server intercepts network traffic.
*   **Network Injection:** The attacker injects malicious flags during the SMB2/3 connection establishment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be positioned in a network path that allows them to intercept and manipulate traffic between a Samba client and its server.
*   **Traffic Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to inject custom flags within SMB2/3 connection packets.
*   **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability is exploitable even when no authentication is required from the client.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects `winbindd` as it uses DCERPC over SMB2/3 when talking to domain controllers.
*   Management tools such as `net`, `samba-tool`, and `rpcclient` that use DCERPC over SMB2/3 are also affected.
*   Other Samba tools are vulnerable if the `client signing` is set to mandatory, or similar and the `client max protocol` is set to SMB2 or higher.

**Affected Products:**

*   Oracle Linux
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (6 & 7), including versions with extended update support and various architectural variants.
*   Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 for RHEL 6 & 7
*   SUSE Enterprise Linux products and related tools.
*   openSUSE Leap, and Tumbleweed
*   Fedora

**Mitigation:**

*   Patches are available for affected software packages.
*   Workarounds involve setting `client ipc max protocol = NT1`. If `client signing` is set to mandatory, it is recommended to remove an explicit setting of `client max protocol`, to default to `NT1`, and this configuration should be reverted once the security fix is applied.

This vulnerability allows for a man-in-the-middle attacker to downgrade SMB signing, thus allowing impersonation and potential remote code execution. Patches are strongly advised for any affected systems.
