Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2360:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Milesight IP cameras have a backdoor with superuser privileges. The SSH server runs on a non-standard port, and it has a root user with a hardcoded password, which is the same for all cameras.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Backdoor: The presence of an SSH server on a non-standard port with a hardcoded root password creates a backdoor.
- Hardcoded credentials: The root user has a password that is the same across all devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete system compromise: Attackers can gain root-level access to the camera via SSH.
- Full control: With root access, an attacker can modify any system configuration, install malware, and potentially use the camera as a bot in a botnet or for surveillance purposes.
- Data exfiltration: The attacker could steal video footage or other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: Attackers need network access to the camera, as the vulnerability is exploited over SSH.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network connectivity: The attacker needs to be able to reach the camera over the network.
- Knowledge of the backdoor: The attacker needs to know the non-standard SSH port and the hardcoded password to gain access.
- No authentication bypass is needed as credentials are hardcoded.
