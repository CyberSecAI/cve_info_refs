Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-2108, extracted from various sources:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies within the ASN.1 encoding process in OpenSSL, specifically related to how it handles a value of zero represented as a negative integer, and large universal tags when parsing ASN.1 data.
*   The vulnerability is a result of the combination of two bugs:
    *   Mishandling of negative zero integers during ASN.1 encoding, leading to a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in `i2c_ASN1_INTEGER`.
    *   Misinterpreting large universal tags as a negative zero value during ASN.1 parsing, specifically within `d2i_ASN1_TYPE`, leading to an out-of-bounds write during re-serialization.
*   The issue is triggered when applications process untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and subsequently re-serialize them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** When encoding a negative zero integer or mishandling large universal tags, OpenSSL can write beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Memory corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to exploitable conditions or crashes.
*   **Integer underflow**: Can also occur due to mishandling of negative integers, triggering the out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** Memory corruption or crashes can cause applications to terminate unexpectedly, leading to service disruptions.
*   **Memory corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can overwrite adjacent memory locations which may lead to further unexpected behaviour.
*   **Information Disclosure:** There is potential for the disclosure of sensitive stack memory data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attackers:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted data through a TLS handshake or by providing malicious files to applications that process ASN.1 data.
*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM):** In the case of X.509 certificates, valid certs from trusted CAs would be required to target vulnerable TLS handshakes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send crafted input:** Attackers must be able to submit specific ASN.1 encoded data, with large universal tags or negative zero values, to the vulnerable application.
*   **Man-in-the-middle:** for MitM attacks, it requires an attacker with the ability to intercept and modify TLS/SSL traffic.
*   **Local access:** For local attacks, it requires the attacker to have some form of local access to the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during ASN.1 re-encoding.
*   The vulnerability is due to a flaw in handling large universal tags as well as â€œnegative zero" integer values within the `i2c_ASN1_INTEGER` and `d2i_ASN1_TYPE` functions in OpenSSL.

**Affected Software:**

*   OpenSSL versions before 1.0.1o and 1.0.2c
*   Various NetApp products using vulnerable OpenSSL versions (see NetApp advisory)
*   Various SUSE and Red Hat products (see vendor advisories)
*   Multiple Cisco products incorporating OpenSSL (see Cisco advisory)
*   Android devices utilizing OpenSSL library

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.1o or later if using the 1.0.1 branch.
*   Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.2c or later if using the 1.0.2 branch.
*   Apply vendor-specific patches for affected products and operating systems.
*   Disable SSLv2, if possible, to prevent downgrade attacks.
*   Restricting access to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses.
*   Disable webserver on affected devices if not required.
