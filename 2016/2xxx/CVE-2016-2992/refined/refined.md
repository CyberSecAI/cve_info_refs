Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2992:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, it is caused by the Data Server Manager (DSM) in the IBM InfoSphere BigInsights Web console not properly handling user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The web console is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web console, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing user session cookies and credentials.
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Defacing the web interface.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Other malicious behavior within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating user-supplied input that is then reflected back to the user via the web console. This could be achieved by crafted URLs or other input fields within the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious input that will be processed by the vulnerable application and reflected back to a victim user's browser.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click the malicious link or interact with the crafted input.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is an XSS flaw in the IBM InfoSphere BigInsights Web console stemming from improper input handling by the Data Server Manager. Successful exploitation could have severe consequences such as user credential theft and unauthorized actions. The fix is to update the DSM to version 2.1.2.
