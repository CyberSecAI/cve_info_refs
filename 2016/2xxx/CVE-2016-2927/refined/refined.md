- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Outdated encryption algorithms used in IBM BigFix Remote Control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of out-of-date encryption algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could obtain sensitive information through man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
