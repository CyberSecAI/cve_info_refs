- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar SIEM stores the encryption key used to encrypt the service account password in a location accessible to a local user with shell access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded encryption key, insecure storage of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user with shell access can obtain the encryption key, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system with shell access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local shell access to the QRadar SIEM system.
