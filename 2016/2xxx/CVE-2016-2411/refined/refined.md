Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-2411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm Power Management kernel driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to local arbitrary code execution within the kernel.
* It could potentially cause a permanent device compromise, possibly requiring a re-flash of the operating system to repair.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is a local malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the affected device.
* The attacker would also need to find a way to elevate privileges from the application to the kernel level. This vulnerability requires first compromising the device and elevation to root.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided text clarifies that this vulnerability, while a kernel code execution bug, is rated as "High" severity instead of "Critical" because it requires first compromising the device and elevation to root.
* The patch for this issue is not in AOSP and is included in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the Google Developer site.
* This vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0 and 6.0.1.
