Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the `libwebm` library. This library is used for processing WebM media files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a memory corruption vulnerability triggered when processing specially crafted media files. This suggests a flaw in how the library parses or handles certain data within the WebM format, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process. The Mediaserver process has elevated privileges, including access to audio and video streams, which can be a pathway to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vectors involve using specially crafted WebM media files. These files can be delivered through multiple channels such as:
   - MMS (multimedia messaging service)
   - Web browsing (playback of media on websites)
   - Other applications that utilize Mediaserver

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to deliver a malicious WebM file to a vulnerable device. This could be achieved by:
    - Sending the file through MMS messages.
    - Hosting the file on a website visited by the user.
    - Delivering it via another app interacting with Mediaserver.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The fix for this CVE is included in an update to the `libvpx` library (which contains `libwebm`).
- The specific commit that addresses the vulnerability is `cc274e2abe8b2a6698a5c47d8aa4bb45f1f9538d` and `65c49d5b382de4085ee5668732bcb0f6ecaf7148` in the `platform/external/libvpx` repository.
- The bug ID associated with the issue is 23167726.
- The fix was cherry-picked from an upstream commit, indicating that the vulnerability also existed in the upstream `libwebm` project.
- It affects all Nexus devices across various Android versions (4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1)

In summary, CVE-2016-2464 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in `libwebm` due to memory corruption issues, exploitable via crafted WebM files delivered through various attack vectors. The fix was addressed by updating the `libvpx` library.
