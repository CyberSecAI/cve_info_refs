Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Exchange ActiveSync component, specifically related to how it handles unauthenticated GET requests. The AutoDiscover process was attempting an unauthenticated GET request as a fallback.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Unauthenticated GET fallback:** The Exchange ActiveSync AutoDiscover code was attempting an unauthenticated GET request as a fallback mechanism. This is problematic because the AutoDiscover process was not functioning correctly, and the fallback attempt would not succeed unless an attacker faked a successful response.
-  **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to gain access to a user's private information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker could potentially gain access to a user's private information by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability is in Exchange ActiveSync, which deals with user's email data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the affected device.

**Additional Details:**

The provided patch notes also include changes to the request content type, disabling automatic redirects, and enabling parsing of namespaces to improve the success of the first two discovery attempts.  It's also important to note that this is a security patch, not intended as a functional fix for the AutoDiscover code.

This vulnerability is rated as "High" severity due to the potential for information disclosure.
