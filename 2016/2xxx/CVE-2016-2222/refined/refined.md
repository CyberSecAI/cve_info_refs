Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-2222:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper validation of URLs used in HTTP requests, specifically related to local URIs. This lack of validation allows for the possibility of initiating Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application, WordPress in this case, can be tricked into making requests to internal services or resources that it shouldn't have access to.
- Insufficient URL Validation:  The application does not adequately validate the target URL of HTTP requests, leading to the SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially use the vulnerable WordPress site to probe internal networks or resources.
- This can expose sensitive information that should not be accessible to the public internet.
- It can potentially be used to bypass firewalls or other security measures.
- In some cases, the attacker might be able to interact with internal services, leading to further exploitation depending on the capabilities of the targeted internal system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker provides a specially crafted URL (likely through a parameter or input field) that points to an internal resource or service.
- The WordPress site, due to the lack of validation, will then make a request to the specified URL, potentially exposing internal network information or services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious URL to the WordPress application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated unless a particular functionality that makes use of HTTP request is protected by authentication.
- The attacker may or may not be on the same network as the vulnerable WordPress install, as SSRF vulnerability can be used to probe a completely different network.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability includes enhanced validation of URLs used in HTTP redirects and a block of the `0.0.0.0/8` address range.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ronni Skansing and reported through a responsible disclosure process.
-  The fix was included in WordPress version 4.4.2.
