Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the SQL parser of phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the way it handles and displays SQL queries with errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  A crafted SQL query can inject malicious JavaScript code into the SQL query page, leading to XSS. This happens because the error message generated by the SQL parser was not properly sanitized before being displayed on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in phpMyAdmin user's session, enabling actions such as:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Data exfiltration:  Accessing sensitive data within phpMyAdmin.
    - Phishing attacks: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Defacement of the phpMyAdmin interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A logged-in user must execute a specifically crafted SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in phpMyAdmin user.
- The attacker must be able to execute SQL queries through phpMyAdmin's interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is considered non-critical, mainly because it requires user authentication to exploit.
- The fix involves escaping the error message before display. The commit `3a6a9a807d99371ee126635e1a505fc1fe0df32c` modifies `libraries/sql-parser/src/Utils/Error.php` to use `htmlspecialchars()` on the error message.
- The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.5.x prior to 4.5.5.1.
