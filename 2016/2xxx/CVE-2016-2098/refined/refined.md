{
  "CVE-2016-2098": {
    "description": "If a web applications does not properly sanitize user inputs, an attacker might control the arguments of the render method in a controller or a view, resulting in the possibility of executing arbitrary ruby code.",
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-controlled input passed to the render method in a Rails application.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Code Injection",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable application, leading to complete compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP request parameters"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and control the arguments of the render method.",
     "details": "The vulnerability exists in the Action Pack component of Ruby on Rails. Applications that directly use user input within the `render` method of a controller or a view are susceptible to this vulnerability. By manipulating request parameters, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary Ruby code. The vulnerability affects versions before 3.2.22.2, 4.x before 4.1.14.2, and 4.2.x before 4.2.5.2. This vulnerability was found by Tobias Kraze from Makandra and joernchen of Phenoelit. The Metasploit module leverages the inline ERB processing to execute code using a JSON request."
