  "CVE-2016-2538": {
    "description": "Qemu emulator built with the USB Net device emulation support is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue. It could occur while processing remote NDIS control message packets. As the incoming informationBufferOffset & Length combination could cross the integer range.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow while processing remote NDIS control message packets due to insufficient validation of `informationBufferOffset` and `Length` fields.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to leak host memory bytes to the guest, or crash the QEMU process instance resulting in DoS.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A privileged user inside the guest sends crafted remote NDIS control messages via the emulated USB network device, causing an integer overflow."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A privileged user within the guest OS."
