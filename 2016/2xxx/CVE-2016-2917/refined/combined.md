# IV84740: VULNERABILITY - DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCE

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as fixed if next.

## Error description

* ```
  The issue reported is that a user opens their notification
  record, and then changes the spec id of that record in the URL
  by changing the last digits to open/view other TRIRIGA records.
  This is causing security vulnerability because user is able to
  see other TRIRIGA records which shouldn't be visible for them.

  Direct Object Reference vulnerabilities relate to the use of
  identifiers that are directly tied to content within a database
  or file system. Applications that expose Direct Object
  References are usually prone to security issues when one user
  is able to view content that belongs to another user by
  changing the reference value. Incomplete or inconsistent access
  controls are typically to blame for this vulnerability.

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  No

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  Fixed. The Notification records with temporary password are
  viewable to all TRIRIGA users. A workflow has been created to
  delete the Notification record with temporary password after
  sending out an email Notification with temporary password to
  user.This issue will be resolved in our next major release
  version, which is tentatively planned for 2H 2016.
