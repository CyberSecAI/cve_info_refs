Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a **Direct Object Reference vulnerability** where a user can manipulate the URL by changing the "spec id" of a notification record to view other TRIRIGA records that they are not authorized to access. This occurs because the application is using identifiers directly tied to content and lacks proper access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Direct Object Reference:** The application exposes internal object references (spec IDs) in the URL, allowing users to directly manipulate them.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The application does not properly validate if the user has permissions to view the specific record identified by the manipulated spec ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users can bypass access controls and view TRIRIGA records that they should not be able to see. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information and potentially other unauthorized actions within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker can change the record identifier (spec id) directly within the URL to attempt to access different records.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the TRIRIGA application and have access to at least one notification record to start the attack.
*   **Basic Understanding of URLs:** The attacker must understand how to modify URLs and the significance of spec id parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text is related to APAR IV84740, which addresses a Direct Object Reference vulnerability in IBM TRIRIGA.
* The vulnerability is related to notification records and how their spec id's could be manipulated in the URL.
* A fix has been implemented to delete notification records with temporary passwords after sending out the notifications.
* The issue is scheduled to be resolved in a future major release, with a tentative plan in the second half of 2016.
