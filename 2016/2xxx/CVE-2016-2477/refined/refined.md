Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the `OMX_IndexVendorVideoExtraData` configuration in the `libOmxVdec` library within Mediaserver. Specifically, it involves the deprecated and unused configuration `OMX_IndexVendorVideoExtraData` which uses non-process-safe methods to pass memory pointers. This leads to memory corruption issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Passing memory pointers in a non-process-safe way when handling the `OMX_IndexVendorVideoExtraData` configuration in `libOmxVdec`.
- **Use of Deprecated Configuration:** The `OMX_IndexVendorVideoExtraData` configuration is deprecated and should not be used as it leads to security issues

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of an elevated system application (Mediaserver).
- **Access to Privileged Information:** The vulnerability could be used to gain access to elevated capabilities such as `Signature` or `SignatureOrSystem` permissions privileges.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run code in the context of `mediaserver`, potentially gaining access to audio/video streams and other sensitive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Media File Processing:** Triggering the vulnerability requires processing of specific media files with the vulnerable configuration.
- It is important to note that while the vulnerability is triggered during the processing of media files, the vulnerability is exploitable by a local malicious app, and not through remote content delivered by MMS or browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device, and requires compromising a service that can call the vulnerable function in the Mediaserver.
- **Ability to trigger media processing**: The attacker must craft a malicious media file and have the system process it, or, call the relevant function within the Mediaserver directly
- The vulnerability is not directly reachable through remote content.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `hardware/qcom/media` component of AOSP.
- The fix involves removing the handling of the deprecated `OMX_IndexVendorVideoExtraData` configuration
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Android from 4.4.4 up to 6.0.1 at the time of the June 2016 security bulletin.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mingjian Zhou, Chiachih Wu, and Xuxian Jiang of C0RE Team.
