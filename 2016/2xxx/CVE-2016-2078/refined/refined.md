Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-2078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It arises from the vSphere Web Client's improper handling of Flash parameters, specifically through the injection of malicious code via the `flashvars` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Flash XSS:** The vSphere Web Client is vulnerable to Flash-based XSS. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious Flash files (.SWF) by manipulating the 'flashvars' parameter.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the 'flashvars' parameter, allowing attackers to introduce arbitrary data.
- **Flash Player Feature Misuse:** The vulnerability leverages the Flash Player's `flashvars` feature, which is meant to pass variables to a Flash movie. Attackers exploit this to pass malicious .SWF file URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary ActionScript Execution:** An attacker can cause the victim's Flash Player to execute arbitrary ActionScript code. Because the malicious code executes in the same security context as the vSphere Web Client, it could have significant consequences.
- **Compromise of vSphere Web Client:**  By controlling the Flash execution environment, an attacker might be able to access or manipulate sensitive data within the vSphere Web Client session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the attack vector. This URL is then sent to the victim, who must click on it for the exploit to occur. The malicious link will have the vulnerable parameter `resourceModuleURLs` set to an attacker controlled URL.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack is performed remotely, with the attacker not needing to have local access to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious link to a victim user.
- **Hosting Malicious SWF File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious .SWF file on a server they control.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the victim to click on the malicious link.
- **Crossdomain Policy:** To have the victim's browser connect to the attacker controlled server, a 'crossdomain.xml' needs to be hosted on the attacker's server, allowing Flash to access resources from other domains.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects VMWare vSphere Web Client versions 5.1 to 6.0.
- The fix involves updating the vCenter Server to version 6.0 U2, 5.5 U3d, or 5.1 U3d, depending on the original version.
- It's important to note that only the vCenter Server needs updating; the client-side vSphere Web Client component does not require patching to resolve the issue.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 4.2 (Medium), with vector string of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
