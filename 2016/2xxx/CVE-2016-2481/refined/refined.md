Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the Mediaserver component, specifically in the `libOmxVenc` library which is part of Qualcomm's media framework.
*   The root cause is a heap overflow during the processing of media data. The issue stems from improper handling of buffer allocation and freeing in the video encoder component (`libOmxVenc`).
*   Specifically, the code allocated up to 64 buffers per input/output port and did not properly track the number of allocated buffers before freeing them which could lead to freeing more than allocated.
*   Additionally, the code lacked validation of parameters/configurations passed to certain methods, allowing for potential arbitrary writes to memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap overflow, which occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it is allocated to hold. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions on the heap.
*   **Improper Input Validation:**  Lack of sanitization of configuration/parameter structures passed to `get/set_config()/parameter()` methods allows writing arbitrary data to memory.
*   **Use-after-free:** Although not explicitly named, a freeing of more buffers than allocated suggests a potential use-after-free condition if the freed buffers are accessed again.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows for code execution within the Mediaserver process, which has elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Mediaserver process.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Since Mediaserver has access to audio and video streams, and other privileges not normally available to third-party apps, this vulnerability can be used for local privilege escalation.
*   **Device compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code within the Mediaserver process could lead to device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A local malicious application could trigger the vulnerability. It appears a compromised service that could call the driver would be required for successful exploitation.
*  The vulnerability can be triggered through media processing, which can be accessed remotely via MMS messages, or through browser playback of media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious media files or data:** An attacker needs to create a specially crafted input that triggers the heap overflow or bypasses the configuration parameter validation.
*   **Local access:**  While remote vectors are mentioned via MMS and browser playback, the actual exploit of this CVE requires a local attacker that is capable of getting a malicious app installed on the device.
*   **Ability to call the vulnerable API:** A malicious application must be able to interact with the vulnerable libOmxVenc API within Mediaserver.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involved adding safety checks to ensure that no more than 64 buffers are used on the input/output port and adding safety checks to ensure that only as many buffers as allocated are freed.
*  Additionally the fix included sanitizing the parameter/configuration structure objects.
* The vulnerability was addressed in the June 2016 Android security patch.
