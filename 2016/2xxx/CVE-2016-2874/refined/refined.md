Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2874:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect authorization check within IBM QRadar SIEM. The software fails to properly verify if a user or process has the necessary permissions to access a resource or perform an action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. This means that access control mechanisms are either missing or not implemented correctly, allowing unauthorized actions or access to resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions within the QRadar SIEM system. The specifics of what actions can be performed are not described in detail, but the general nature of an authorization bypass implies a potentially significant impact, such as the ability to view sensitive data, modify configurations, or potentially impact the security posture of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through network access to the vulnerable QRadar SIEM system, although the specific mechanism of exploitation is not provided. The provided documents do not go into details regarding what type of access was vulnerable or how to exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
