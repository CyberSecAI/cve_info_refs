  "CVE-2016-2179": {
    "description": "The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries associated with unused out-of-order messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, related to d1_lib.c, statem_dtls.c, statem_lib.c, and statem_srvr.c.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of out-of-order DTLS messages. Queue entries for these messages were not properly removed from the buffer after handshake completion leading to memory exhaustion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory exhaustion",
          "Denial of Service"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers could cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends specially crafted out-of-order DTLS messages to the server.",
