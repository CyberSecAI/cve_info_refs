Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of the Apache Tomcat server within IBM Integration Bus and WebSphere Message Broker for handling HTTP requests. Specifically, a malformed HTTP POST request can trigger an error that exposes a Java stack trace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of a Java stack trace in response to a malformed HTTP POST request. This stack trace reveals details about the Apache Tomcat version being used.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability indicates a lack of proper input validation or sanitization when processing HTTP POST requests, allowing a malformed request to trigger an error condition and expose the stack trace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** The exposed stack trace can be used to identify the version of Apache Tomcat being used. This information can potentially be used by an attacker to identify known vulnerabilities within that specific Tomcat version. This information can be used in further attacks but the vulnerability in itself doesn't provide direct access or control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated, meaning the attacker does not need prior access to the server.
- **Malformed HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malformed HTTP POST request to the integration server's HTTP listener.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate or have any special privileges on the system.

**Summary of relevant information:**

- **Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure via Stack Trace.
- **Affected Products:** IBM Integration Bus V10.0, V9.0, and WebSphere Message Broker V8.0
- **Attack Vector:** Sending a Malformed HTTP POST request to the vulnerable service.
- **Impact:** Disclosure of the Apache Tomcat version via stack trace, aiding in further reconnaissance and attack.
- **CVSS Vector:** (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
