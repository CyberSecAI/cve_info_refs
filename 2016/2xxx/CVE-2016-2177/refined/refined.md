{
  "CVE-2016-2177": {
    "Description": "OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, related to s3_srvr.c, ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. The idiom 'if (p + len > limit)' is undefined when 'len > SIZE' where 'p' is a pointer to malloc'd data of SIZE bytes and 'limit' is 'p + SIZE'. This can lead to an integer overflow, making the check unreliable and allowing the code to proceed with incorrect values.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Incorrect boundary check"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers could cause a Denial of Service condition due to a heap memory corruption or application crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can trigger the vulnerability through malformed TLS/SSL messages, especially within the ClientHello record.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker able to send a specially crafted TLS/SSL message, which includes a large 'len' value, to a vulnerable server or client."
  },
  "CVE-2016-2178": {
    "Description": "The dsa_sign_setup function in crypto/dsa/dsa_ossl.c in OpenSSL through 1.0.2h does not properly ensure the use of constant-time operations, which makes it easier for local users to discover a DSA private key via a timing side-channel attack.",
    "Root cause": "The DSA signing algorithm does not enforce constant-time operations when computing signatures, exposing a timing side-channel.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing Side Channel Attack",
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local attackers may be able to recover a private DSA key via a timing side-channel attack.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attackers, timing side-channel attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with the ability to observe timing differences during DSA signing operations."
