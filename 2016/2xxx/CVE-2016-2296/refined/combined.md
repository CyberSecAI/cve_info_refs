ICS Advisory
# Meteocontrol WEB'log Vulnerabilities (Update A)

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-133-01A

## OVERVIEW

This updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-16-133-01 Meteocontrol WEB'log Vulnerabilities that was published May 12, 2016, on the NCCIC/ICS‑CERT web site.

Independent researcher Karn Ganeshen has identified one authentication and two information exposure vulnerabilities in Meteocontrol’s WEB’log application. Meteocontrol has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following WEB’log products are affected:

* Basic 100 all versions,
* Light all versions,
* Pro all versions, and
* Pro Unlimited all versions.

## IMPACT

Sensitive information can be accessed, and admin login pages are accessible without being authenticated.

### **--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow silent execution of unauthorized actions on the device such as modifying plant data; modifying modbus/inverter/other devices; configuration parameters; and saving modified configuration and device reboot.

### **--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 --------**

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Meteocontrol is a Germany-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, China, Italy, Spain, France, Switzerland, and Israel.

The affected products, WEB’log, are web-based SCADA systems that provide functions to manage energy and power configurations in different connected (energy/industrial) devices. According to Meteocontrol, WEB’log is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Meteocontrol estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe with a small percentage in the United States.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Meteocontrol strongly recommends users install the WEB'log behind a firewall. It is not intended to be used with a direct connection to the Internet. Meteocontrol has produced a new version that fixes the vulnerabilities. It can be downloaded at:

<http://us.meteocontrol.com/downloads/>.

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

# [ICS] Meteocontrol WEB’log Multiple Vulnerabilities

[ICS] Meteocontrol WEB’log Multiple Vulnerabilities

*About MeteoControl WEB’log*

Meteocontrol is a Germany-based company that maintains offices in several
countries around the world, including the US, China, Italy, Spain, France,
Switzerland, and Israel.

The affected products, WEB’log, are web-based SCADA systems that provide
functions to manage energy and power configurations in different connected
(energy/industrial) devices.

According to Meteocontrol, WEB’log is deployed across several sectors
including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water
and Wastewater Systems. Meteocontrol estimates that these products are used
primarily in Europe with a small percentage in the United States.

*Product details here:*
<http://www.meteocontrol.com/en/industrial-line/data-logger-weblogs/weblog/>

*Multiple versions of this application are offered:*
WEB'log Basic 100
WEB'log Light
WEB'log Pro
WEB'log Pro Unlimited

All Meteocontrol’s WEB’log versions / flavors have the same underlying
design and are vulnerable.

This product is deployed primarily in Power & Energy domain, and is used
worldwide. It is rebranded in different countries, a few that I came across
are as follows:

   - WEB’log Pro (branded by Siemens) - US
   - Powador-proLOG (branded by KACO new energy) - Germany
   - Aurora Easy Control / Aurora Easy Control Basic (both branded by power
   one) - Italy
   - Data Control Pro (branded by Mastervolt) - France

+++++
*Weak Credential Management*

Default Login password is ist02
-> gives easy administrative access to anyone

Issue:
Mandatory password change is not enforced by the application.

*Access Control Flaws*
CVE-2016-2296

All pages, functions, and data, can still be accessed without
administrative log in. This can be achieved by directly accessing the URLs.

This includes access to configuration pages, ability to change plant data,
configured modbus/inverter devices, configuration parameters, and even
rebooting the device.

For example:
Making the following direct request, dumps the source code of page that
contains administrator password-
<http://IP/html/en/confAccessProt.html>

Modbus related configuration can be dumped by calling the following url:
<http://IP/html/en/confUnvModbus.html>

Access modbus devices
<http://IP/html/en/ajax/viewunvmodbus.xml>

Similarly, certain POST requests can be used to Modify Plant Configuration
Data, without any authentication.

Issue:
Access control is not enforced correctly.

*Sensitive information exposure*
CVE-2016-2298

As noted above, Administrator password is stored in clear-text. So anyone
can make a request to this page and get the clear-text Administrative
password for the application, and gain privileged access.

Issue:
Password is stored in clear-text.

*Hidden/Obscured CMD shell*
CVE-2016-2297

Another interesting feature is presence of a CMD shell. Meteocontrol
WEB'log management application offers a CMD shell which allows running a
restricted set of commands that gives host, application and stats data.

And as like other functions, it can be accessed directly without any
authentication -
<http://IP/html/en/xprtCmd.html>

Assuming no one will be able to figure out a technique to exploit this
feature, is not a great idea.

*No CSRF protection - Vulnerable to CSRF attacks*
There is no CSRF Token generated per page and / or per (sensitive)
function. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow silent
execution of unauthorized actions on the device such as modifying plant
data, modifying modbus/inverter/any other PLC devices, changing
Administrator password, changing configuration parameters, saving modified
configuration, & device reboot.

+++++

ICS-CERT published Meteocontrol advisory at:
<https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-16-133-01>

Note that it is not complete and accurate. I have already sent my comments
to ICS-CERT team to correct their report. Hopefully they will update it
soon.

+++++

Cheers!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
