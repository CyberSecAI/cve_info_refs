Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-2442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm buspm driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain full control of the device. This may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A local malicious application is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
*   The patch for this vulnerability is not in AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and is part of the binary drivers for Nexus devices provided by Google.
*   The severity is rated as High because exploiting this vulnerability requires first compromising a service to call the driver. While kernel code execution bugs are normally rated as Critical, this one is rated High due to the required pre-existing compromise.

This vulnerability is specifically applicable to Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, and Nexus 6P devices.
