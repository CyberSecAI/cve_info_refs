IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1.0 thru V4.1.1.7

IBM GPFS V4.1.0.0 thru V4.1.0.8

IBM GPFS V3.5.0.0 thru V3.5.0.31

All older IBM GPFS versions no longer in service

## Remediation/Fixes

For IBM Spectrum Scale V4.2.0.0 thru V4.2.0.3, apply IBM Spectrum Scale V4.2.0.4 available from Fix Central at

<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%2Bdefined%2Bstorage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=4.2.0&platform=All&function=all>

For IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1.0 thru 4.1.1.7 and IBM GPFS V4.1.0.0 thru V4.1.0.8, apply V4.1.1.8 at<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%2Bdefined%2Bstorage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=4.1.1&platform=All&function=all>

For IBM GPFS V3.5.0.0 thru V3.5.0.31, apply V3.5.0.32 at

<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Cluster%2Bsoftware&product=ibm/power/IBM+General+Parallel+File+System&release=3.5.0&platform=All&function=all>

For older versions of IBM GPFS, if you have an extended service contract, please contact IBM Service.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Until the fixes can be applied, a workaround is to remove the setuid from the files in the **/usr/lpp/mmfs/bin** directory. Determine the set of files with setuid bit by running

**ls -l /usr/lpp/mmfs/bin | grep r-s**

Then reset the setuid bit for each such file by issuing this command on each file

**chmod u-s** *file*

Once the workaround is applied, a number of commands may no longer work when not invoked by unprivileged users, including:

**mmchfileset**

**mmcrsnapshot**

**mmdelsnapshot**

**mmdf**

**mmedquota**

**mmgetacl**

**mmlsdisk**

**mmlsfileset**

**mmlsfs**

**mmlsmgr**

**mmlspolicy**

**mmlspool**

**mmlsquota**

**mmlssnapshot**

**mmputacl**

**mmsnapdir**
