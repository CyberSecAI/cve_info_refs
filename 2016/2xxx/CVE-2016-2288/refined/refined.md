Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2288:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper privilege management within Cogent DataHub versions 7.3.9 and prior. Specifically, a low-privileged user can gain elevated privileges by modifying a specific file that the application accesses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The application allows a low-privileged user to modify a file (`WebstreamSupport.g` in `C:\usr\cogent\require\`) which leads to the execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges when the application polls for the gamma script.
*  **Insecure File Access:** The application accesses and interprets the script from a location where it is writable by non-admin users.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the contents of the Gamma Script file, allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate their privileges from a low-privileged user (guest) to SYSTEM.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system, including data theft, installation of malware, or disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the target machine. An attacker must be able to write to the directory `C:\usr\cogent\require\`.
*   **File Modification:** The attacker must modify the file (`WebstreamSupport.g`).
*   **Application Execution/Polling**: The vulnerability is triggered when the Cogent DataHub application is running and it polls for Gamma Scripts. The service does not need to be installed, as long as the application has been executed by a privileged user before.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Access:** An attacker needs only low-privilege access to the machine.
*   **File Write Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to write to the directory `C:\usr\cogent\require\`.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker has to know where the application is looking for the gamma script.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit does not require a restart of the machine or the service.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Steven Seeley of Source Incite.
*  Cogent addressed the vulnerability in version 7.3.10.
* The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable and requires local user interaction.

This detailed information provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the potential impact, which goes beyond the basic CVE description.
