Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `System_server` component of Android.
- Specifically, it resides within the Skia graphics library, which is used by `System_server`.
- The vulnerability arises due to an unspecified flaw when handling certain data within Skia.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in `System_server` due to the Skia library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the `System_server`, which runs with elevated privileges.
- This means the malicious app gains elevated capabilities, including `Signature` or `SignatureOrSystem` permissions, which are normally inaccessible to third-party apps.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local malicious application installed on the device.
- The malicious application must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within the `System_server` through the Skia library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
- The attacker must be able to execute code within the context of this application and craft the appropriate input to trigger the vulnerability in Skia within `System_server`.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is rated as "High" severity because it can lead to an elevation of privilege.
- A patch for this vulnerability is available in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
- The affected versions include Android 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1.
