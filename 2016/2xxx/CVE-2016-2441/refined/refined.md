      "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Qualcomm buspm driver.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel."
      ],
      "impact": "A local malicious application could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context, potentially leading to a permanent device compromise. Normally a kernel code execution bug like this would be rated Critical, but because it first requires compromising a service that can call the driver, it is rated as High severity.",
