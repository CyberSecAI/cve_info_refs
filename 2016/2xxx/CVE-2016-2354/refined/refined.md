- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Lemur BlueDriver device does not require a PIN for Bluetooth access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for critical function (CWE-306). The device allows unauthenticated Bluetooth connections, granting access to the vehicle's CAN bus.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker within Bluetooth range can send arbitrary commands to the vehicle's CAN bus. This could lead to information disclosure (standard OBD-II data), manipulation of vehicle systems, and potentially affect safety-critical systems such as steering or braking. The impact varies based on the vehicle make and model.
- **Attack vectors**: Bluetooth connection to the Lemur BlueDriver device. An attack could be launched from any device within Bluetooth range, including compromised devices within the vehicle itself.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the BlueDriver device and have the ability to send CAN commands. No prior authentication is required.
