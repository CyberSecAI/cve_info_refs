Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-2208

**Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Symantec Antivirus Engine when parsing executables packed with an early version of ASPack. The vulnerability occurs when section data is truncated, meaning `SizeOfRawData` is greater than `SizeOfImage`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Heap/Pool Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a heap-based buffer overflow (on Linux, Mac, and Unix) or kernel memory corruption (on Windows) due to improper handling of truncated section data in ASPack-packed executables.
*   **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The vulnerability stems from allocating `SizeOfImage` bytes and then copying `SectionSizeOnDisk` bytes into the buffer, without proper bounds checking, when `SectionSizeOnDisk` is larger, leading to the overflow. Specifically, the following sequence of events is vulnerable:
    ```
    char *buf = malloc(SizeOfImage);

    memcpy(&buf[DataSection->VirtualAddress],
           DataSection->PointerToRawData,
           SectionSizeOnDisk);
    ```
    where `SectionSizeOnDisk` is greater than the allocated size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, where an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause a system crash (BSOD on Windows) or service crash. Specifically, on Windows, this results in kernel memory corruption, leading to a complete system failure. On other platforms, this results in a remote heap overflow as root in the Symantec or Norton process.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** On Windows with Symantec Endpoint Antivirus, this vulnerability permits code execution as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` in the `ccSvcHost.exe` process. On Norton Antivirus for Windows, the code is loaded into the kernel and results in kernel pool corruption.
*   **System Instability:** The memory corruption can lead to unpredictable system behavior and crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Email:** Sending a specially crafted malicious file via email to a victim is enough to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Web Browser:** Downloading a specially crafted malicious file from a web browser can also trigger the vulnerability.
*   **File I/O:** Because Symantec uses a filter driver to intercept all system I/O, simply having a file touch the disk is enough to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious file to the target or lure them to download one.
*   **File Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious executable with the specific format (ASPack-packed with a truncated section data) that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction on some platforms:**  Just downloading or having the file on disk is enough for the exploit to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of Symantec products, including Symantec Endpoint Antivirus, Norton Antivirus, Symantec Scan Engine, and Symantec Email Security, on multiple platforms.
*   The exploit triggers a `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA` (0x50) bugcheck on Windows, resulting in a BSOD. The fault occurs within `nt!memcpy`, while attempting a `rep movs dword ptr es:[edi],dword ptr [esi]` operation with corrupted memory.
* The vulnerability is in the core scan engine of Symantec products.
* A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available.

In summary, this is a critical vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems with minimal user interaction, leading to severe consequences including RCE, privilege escalation and system crashes.
