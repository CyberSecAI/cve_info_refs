{
  "CVE-2016-2820": {
    "Description": "The Firefox Health Reports (aka FHR or about:healthreport) feature in Mozilla Firefox before 46.0 does not properly restrict the origin of events, which makes it easier for remote attackers to modify sharing preferences by leveraging access to the remote-report IFRAME element.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Firefox Health Report (FHR) feature was accepting events from any content document within the remote-report iframe, without proper origin checks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate origin validation"
    ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially change a user's sharing preferences in Firefox. By injecting malicious content into the remote-report iframe, an attacker can send commands to the FHR to change the sharing settings.",
     "Attack vectors": [
          "A separate vulnerability could allow the injection of web content in the remote-report iframe. A compromised CDN serving the FHR content could also be an attack vector.",
          "An attacker can also inject content into the remote-report iframe through other vulnerabilities that bypass security restrictions, such as XSS."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to either inject content into the remote-report iframe through some other means, or compromise the CDN serving the FHR content. They do not require user credentials, and the victim user would have to visit the specially crafted website/compromised page."
