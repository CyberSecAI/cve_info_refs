Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within PowerDNS Authoritative Server when validating the size of a crafted zone record.
*   Specifically, the server fails to correctly check if the content of a record matches the expected size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the integer overflow that occurs during the size check of a DNS record. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended size restrictions.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Due to the incorrect size check, a read past the buffer boundary can be triggered, potentially causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause the PowerDNS server to crash by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Server Crash:** The overflow and subsequent out-of-bounds read leads to a crash of the pdns server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted DNS Record:** The attack involves injecting a specially crafted DNS record into a zone that is under the attacker's control.
*   **DNS Query:**  After injecting the malicious record, the attacker then sends a DNS query to the server requesting the crafted record. This triggers the vulnerability during the record size validation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authorized User:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user capable of inserting records in a zone managed by the vulnerable server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send DNS queries to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
*   The issue is addressed in pdns versions 3.4.11, 4.0.4, pdns-recursor 3.7.4, and pdns-recursor 4.0.4.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a DNS query for the crafted record, leading to a server crash.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3764-1) also references CVE-2016-2120, along with other related vulnerabilities in pdns.
*   The issue is described as a "read past the buffer boundary" and an "integer overflow".

This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability than the initial CVE description.
