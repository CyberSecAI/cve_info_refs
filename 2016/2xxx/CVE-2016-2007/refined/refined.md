- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way `OmniInet.exe` parses `EXEC_SCRIPT` requests. It blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a malformed `EXEC_SCRIPT` request to the `OmniInet.exe` process listening on TCP port 5555.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs network access to the target system.
