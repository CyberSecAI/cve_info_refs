{
  "CVE-2016-2168": {
    "Description": "The req_check_access function in the mod_authz_svn module in the httpd server in Apache Subversion before 1.8.16 and 1.9.x before 1.9.4 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via a crafted header in a (1) MOVE or (2) COPY request, involving an authorization check.",
    "Root cause": "A flaw in the authorization logic of mod_authz_svn when handling COPY or MOVE requests with specially crafted headers, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can crash the Subversion server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network - via crafted HTTP headers in COPY or MOVE requests"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated on the targeted server. However, servers allowing anonymous reads are vulnerable without authentication."
