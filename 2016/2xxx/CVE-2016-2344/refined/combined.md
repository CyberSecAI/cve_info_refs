## Autodesk Backburner Manager contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#732760

Original Release Date: 2016-03-28 | Last Revised: 2016-03-28

---

### Overview

Autodesk Backburner 2016, version 2016.0.0.2150 and earlier, fails to properly check the length of command input which may be leveraged to create a denial of service condition or to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| [**CWE-121**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow** - CVE-2016-2344  The [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/troubleshooting/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Installation-3DSMax/files/GUID-F6732A30-821C-4547-9FAA-E46BCA13392A-htm.html) describes Backburner as network-rendering management software that supports Autodesk products. The Backburner Manager process listens on TCP/UDP port 3234 by default, though the user may configure the application to use another port. Also note that the process listens on other ports, which may also expose the vulnerability. There is no authentication scheme to restrict access to the service, and the length of command input is not checked. An unauthenticated attacker may directly send specially crafted commands to the interface to overflow the stack buffer, which may be leveraged to crash the service or to gain arbitrary code execution in the context of the user who started the service. Since the software by design permits unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands using the cmdjob utility (refer to [CVE-2007-4749](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4749)), the CVSS score below only accounts for exploitation to achieve denial of service.Note that in the original [Symantec disclosure document](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/research/SYMSA-2007-008.txt) describing CVE-2007-4749, the vendor advises users concerned by the security implications to "remove the cmdjob utility from his system." This is not a suitable workaround since the absence of the cmdjob client on the server host has no effect on a remote user's ability to run the cmdjob utility on another system or to produce the network traffic that the official cmdjob client generates. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code and create a denial of service condition in Backburner 2016. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem and recommends the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restrict access to the Backburner 2016 manager.exe service to trusted users and networks. By default, the service listens on TCP/UDP port 3234 in addition to others that should be identified by a system administrator. |

### [Autodesk, Inc](#BLUU-A52LEH) Affected

Notified:  December 09, 2015  Updated: March 28, 2016

**Statement Date:   March 25, 2016**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have reviewed the submission below and determined that its not an issue.The discovered issue is not applicable as the product port (http) is not meant to be used on an internet facing connection. Deployment of the product service is intranet only. The product is also in maintenance release only and has been for over a year. The port (http) is used to monitor running jobs. There is no sensitive data there and the discovered issue of a possible DDOS means the service would be unavailable at most (though this isn’t a internet deployed service as mentioned above.)

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The following points should be considered with respect to the above statement:

• The Backburner Manager process is not an HTTP service. It is a command line interface that can be connected to directly (e.g. telnet).
 • Backburner Manager has been observed to listen on multiple ports, though in a default configuration, port 3234 is specified.
 • The manner in which Backburner is deployed almost certainly varies by user, regardless of the intentions of the vendor. Users should be aware that it permits the execution of arbitrary code by design (CVE-2007-4749).
 • The buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2016-2344) may be leveraged to terminate the Backburner service (a denial-of-service condition, not distributed). Code execution is possible, but does not grant any additional advantage to an attacker because of CVE-2007-4749.
