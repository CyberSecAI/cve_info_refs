# Security Notice: Closing an Exponent Security Vulnerability

Thursday, January 14, 2016
Tags:
[security](http://www.exponentcms.org/news/showall_by_tags/tag/security/src/%40random4cd2029e6042b "View all items tagged with 'security'")

We've been notified of a security vulnerability which could compromise your Exponent CMS installation.  This vulnerability applies to all versions of Exponent 2.x up to v2.3.7 patch #2.  **The immediate fix is to rename the /install folder to something else, or remove/delete it.** Though we've been working hard to close Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, this one could be more permanent and seems to result from an anomaly within PHP which allows a string variable to be internally interpreted and processed as an array thereby masking the payload.

To see if your site has been infected, you'll need to view the /conf/config.php file in older versions or the /framework/conf/config.php in newer installations.  If infected, you will find an additional line at or near the bottom of that file which is not simply a 'define', but will have two commands on the same line separated by a semi-colon with the remainder of the line commented out. Normally a line in config.php would look something like:

`define("DB_ENGINE",'mysqli');`

however, an infected line would look similar to:

`define("",""); PASSTHRU($_GET[",'"]); // ');`

**The immediate fix to this type infection is to remove/delete the affected line from the config.php file**

We'll be shipping a formal fix to this vulnerability within a few days.  This patch #3 to v2.3.7 will also include the entire '/install' folder to ensure your v2.3.7 site can be upgraded.  The /install folder is needed not only for installations, but is also used for version upgrades, or for running an upgrade script from the Exponent/Super-Admin menu.

# Patch #3 Released for V2.3.7

Saturday, January 23, 2016
Tags:
[patch](http://www.exponentcms.org/news/showall_by_tags/tag/patch/src/%40random4cd2029e6042b "View all items tagged with 'patch'"), [release](http://www.exponentcms.org/news/showall_by_tags/tag/release/src/%40random4cd2029e6042b "View all items tagged with 'release'"), [bugs](http://www.exponentcms.org/news/showall_by_tags/tag/bugs/src/%40random4cd2029e6042b "View all items tagged with 'bugs'")

This patch fixes several issues in the v2.3.7 release and v2.3.7 patch #1 and patch#2.  It also provides several tweaks and even some new features. The main fix is for a [security vulnerability](/news/show/title/security-notice-closing-an-exponent-security-vulnerability) using malformed arrays.  It also provides some regression fixes to the text module inline-edit view(s). It must be noted that this patch will (again) **break any custom text module view templates using in-place editing**. This patch adds a couple new features to Twitter Bootstrap 3 based themes in the form of a new date/time picker widget, and a new photoalbum slideshow/carousel widget. There are a few other tweaks and fixes found in this patch. Unlike previous patches, this patch file also includes all the 'installation' files in the event you secured your site by deleting or renaming the /install folder. Patch #3 to v2.3.7 is found at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/exponentcms/files/exponent-2.3.7-patch-3.zip/download>**​**

**v237patch3 adds these features to v237, v237patch1, and v237patch2:**

**v237patch3 fixes these issues in v237, v237patch1, and v237patch2:**

!!! Security fix for vulnerability using malformed associative arrays

!!! Regression fix possible save/delete action permissions issue using text module inline edit view

    !!! THIS FIX BREAKS EXISTING CUSTOM TEXT SHOWALL INLINE (EDIT) VIEWS

- better implementation of setting (new) file/folder permissions (2 new optional upgrade scripts to assist)

- some faq module views and styles were broken

- simplifies .htaccess file

**v237patch3 updates these 3rd party libraries in v237, v237patch1, and v237patch2:**
