The provided content relates to CVE-2016-2242.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from an anomaly in PHP that allows a string variable to be internally interpreted and processed as an array. This allows attackers to inject malicious code by masking it within a string variable, which is then processed as an array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Malformed associative array handling that leads to remote code execution.
- Lack of proper input sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could compromise the Exponent CMS installation by allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Specifically, an attacker could insert a line of code within the `config.php` that would execute system commands via `passthru()` function.

**Attack vectors:**
- The exact attack vector isn't described, but it involves injecting a malicious string that is later processed as an array, allowing for code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the `config.php` file, likely through an exploit in the /install directory or other vulnerabilities, although this is not specified in the provided content.
