# Security Bulletin: IBM Tivoli Monitoring Buffer Overflow (CVE-2016-2946 )

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A utility shipped as part of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) Shared Libraries ("ax" component) is subject to a buffer overflow.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2946](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2946) IBM Tivoli Monitoring Agent is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. With specially crafted input, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges.

CVSS Base Score: 8.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113592> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

The Shared Libraries ("ax" component) versions 6.2.2 through 6.3.0 FP1 on UNIX and Linux are affected. The Shared Libraries are shipped as part of all ITM components including servers (e.g. portal server, monitoring server) as well as all ITM agents (e.g. OS Agents, Agentless Agents, ITCAM Agents)
