Dell SecureWorks iOS Application - MITM SSL Certificate Vulnerability
--
<http://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Dell-SecureWorks.html>

Overview

"Access your critical Dell SecureWorks security information on the go."

"With the Dell SecureWorks Mobile App you can:

* Quickly respond to security incidents on your mobile device
* Review/update/create tickets for your critical security events
* Contact the Dell SecureWorks Secure Operations Centers 24/7/365
* Get the latest threat intelligence from our award winning Counter
Threat Intelligence (CTU) team"

Issue

The Dell SecureWorks iOS application (version 2.0.6 and below) does
not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to a
secure site.

Impact

bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Usernames, passwords and sensitive information could be captured by an
attacker without the user's knowledge.
