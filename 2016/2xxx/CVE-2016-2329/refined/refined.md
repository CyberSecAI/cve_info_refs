Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2329:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `libavcodec/tiff.c` file within FFmpeg. Specifically, it stems from the improper validation of `RowsPerStrip` values and YCbCr chrominance subsampling factors when decoding TIFF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not adequately check the `RowsPerStrip` values and YCbCr chrominance subsampling factors, which allows for out-of-bounds array access.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Array Access:**  The lack of proper validation can lead to accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service due to the out-of-bounds array access, which could crash the application.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** There is a possibility of other unspecified consequences, as noted in the description, but these are not detailed. However, the CVSS v3 score suggests potential for high confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted TIFF Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted TIFF files designed to exploit the improper validation.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can trigger it by sending a malicious TIFF file over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send or provide the crafted TIFF file to the vulnerable system.
*   **User Interaction:** According to the CVSS v3 score, user interaction is required, implying the crafted TIFF file may need to be opened by the user (i.e via a vulnerable application that uses ffmpeg).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions prior to 2.8.6.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading to FFmpeg version 2.8.6 or later.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a "moderate" severity by SUSE, but the CVSS v3 score indicates high potential impact.
