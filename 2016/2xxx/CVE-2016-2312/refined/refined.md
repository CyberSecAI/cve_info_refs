Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `kscreenlocker` handles screen disconnections and reconnections. When all screens are turned off (or disconnected) while the lock screen is active, the `kscreenlocker_greet` process could exit prematurely. This exit, under normal circumstances, signals a successful unlock, thus bypassing the lock screen when the screen is turned back on. This is due to Qt's behavior where disconnecting all screens leads to the destruction of all views, and the application exiting because of it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of screen disconnections: The lock screen greeter process (`kscreenlocker_greet`) was not designed to handle scenarios where all screens are disconnected.
- Premature exit of the greeter process: When all screens are turned off, the greeter process exits, which is interpreted as a successful unlock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to a locked system: An attacker could bypass the lock screen by simply turning off and then on the display.
- Physical access required: The attacker needs physical access to the machine to toggle the monitor power.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Turning off and then on a display: This action triggers the vulnerability and bypasses the lock screen, gaining access to the logged-in session without a password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access to the target machine.
- Ability to control the power state of the monitor (or disconnect/reconnect it).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to systems running KDE Plasma versions prior to 5.5.5, and plasma-workspace versions prior to 5.5.0.
- The issue is exacerbated when using DisplayPort connections, but it can also occur in other display configurations.
- The fix involves preventing `kscreenlocker_greet` from exiting when all screens are disconnected by setting `setQuitOnLastWindowClosed(false)` in the greeter's `main.cpp`.
- Patches were provided for various branches of plasma-workspace and kscreenlocker to address the vulnerability.
- A regression was introduced by the patch, which was later addressed with a further patch.
- The fix was released in kscreenlocker 5.5.5.
