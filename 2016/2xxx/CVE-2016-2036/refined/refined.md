Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `getURL()` function within the `secfilter` kernel module of Samsung Android devices. This function is responsible for parsing URLs from HTTP requests when URL filtering is enabled.
*   The issue arises when an HTTP request with no URL is processed. Specifically, when the `findStringByTag()` function does not find a valid URL path, it leaves the `node->url` field uninitialized (NULL).  A subsequent dereference of this NULL pointer leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `getURL()` function after an attempt to parse a malformed HTTP request with no URL.
*   **Insecure URL Parsing:**  The custom URL parsing logic within the kernel module is flawed, failing to handle malformed requests properly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a kernel panic, effectively crashing the Android device. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting and sending a malformed HTTP request with no URL.
*   **User-Space Trigger:** Any user-space application can trigger the vulnerability once the URL filtering mechanism is enabled by an authorized app, highlighting that the vulnerability is not limited to the authorized app which enables the filtering functionality

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **URL Filtering Enabled:** An attacker doesn't need `SAMSUNG_GET_URL` permission to trigger the crash, but the URL filtering mechanism must be active, which requires an app with `SAMSUNG_GET_URL` permission to enable it via `ioctl()` on the `/dev/url` device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed HTTP request, which could be achieved by establishing a TCP connection and sending an HTTP request to any destination. The target does not need to reach the destination, as the parsing happens before the packet is sent.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Module:** The vulnerability resides in a custom kernel module named `secfilter` developed by Samsung.
*   **Function:** The affected function is `getURL()` in the `drivers/secfilter/urlparser.c` file.
*   **Mitigation** The vulnerability was fixed with the security patch included in the Feb 2016 Samsung update.
