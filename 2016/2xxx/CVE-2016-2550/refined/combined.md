# USN-2947-3: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerabilities

6 April 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux

Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect

system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](/security/CVE-2016-2085))

It was discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not correctly compute branch offsets

for backward jumps after ctx expansion. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-2383](/security/CVE-2016-2383))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file

descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over

a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](/security/CVE-2016-2550))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1028-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1028.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1028.36)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user\_structThe commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
be credited.
To do so, we add a reference counted struct user\_struct pointer to the
scm\_fp\_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux

Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect

system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](/security/CVE-2016-2085))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file

descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over

a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](/security/CVE-2016-2550))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Packages

* [linux-lts-wily](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-wily) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux

Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect

system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](/security/CVE-2016-2085))

It was discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not correctly compute branch offsets

for backward jumps after ctx expansion. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-2383](/security/CVE-2016-2383))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file

descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over

a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](/security/CVE-2016-2550))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provides fixes for certain Oracle products for the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) Intel processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the [Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1) MOS note (Doc ID 2347948.1).

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 238 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [January 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2338411.1)

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2018 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 27 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware. 21 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 18 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information
leak or data loss.

CVE-2013-4312

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that users can use pipes queued on local
    (Unix) sockets to allocate an unfair share of kernel memory, leading
    to denial-of-service (resource exhaustion).

    This issue was previously mitigated for the stable suite by limiting
    the total number of files queued by each user on local sockets. The
    new kernel version in both suites includes that mitigation plus
    limits on the total size of pipe buffers allocated for each user.

CVE-2015-7566

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that the visor
    driver crashes when a specially crafted USB device without bulk-out
    endpoint is detected.

CVE-2015-8767

    An SCTP denial-of-service was discovered which can be triggered by a
    local attacker during a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way
    handshake.

CVE-2015-8785

    It was discovered that local users permitted to write to a file on a
    FUSE filesystem could cause a denial of service (unkillable loop in
    the kernel).

CVE-2015-8812

    A flaw was found in the iw_cxgb3 Infiniband driver. Whenever it
    could not send a packet because the network was congested, it would
    free the packet buffer but later attempt to send the packet again.
    This use-after-free could result in a denial of service (crash or
    hang), data loss or privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-8816

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the USB hub driver.
    This may be used by a physically present user for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2015-8830

    Ben Hawkes of Google Project Zero reported that the AIO interface
    permitted reading or writing 2 GiB of data or more in a single
    chunk, which could lead to an integer overflow when applied to
    certain filesystems, socket or device types. The full security
    impact has not been evaluated.

CVE-2016-0723

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the TIOCGETD ioctl.
    A local attacker could use this flaw for denial-of-service.

CVE-2016-0774

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 in kernel versions older
    than Linux 3.16 did not correctly handle the case of a partially
    failed atomic read. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
    to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user space.

CVE-2016-2069

    Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in flushing of the TLB
    when switching tasks on an x86 system. On an SMP system this could
    possibly lead to a crash, information leak or privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2384

    Andrey Konovalov found that a crafted USB MIDI device with an
    invalid USB descriptor could trigger a double-free. This may be used
    by a physically present user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2543

    Dmitry Vyukov found that the core sound sequencer driver (snd-seq)
    lacked a necessary check for a null pointer, allowing a user
    with access to a sound sequencer device to cause a denial-of-
    service (crash).

CVE-2016-2544, CVE-2016-2546, CVE-2016-2547, CVE-2016-2548

    Dmitry Vyukov found various race conditions in the sound subsystem
    (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound devices
    could use these to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2545

    Dmitry Vyukov found a flaw in list manipulation in the sound
    subsystem (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound
    devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2549

    Dmitry Vyukov found a potential deadlock in the sound subsystem
    (ALSA)'s use of high resolution timers. A user with access to sound
    devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (hang).

CVE-2016-2550

    The original mitigation of CVE-2013-4312, limiting the total number
    of files a user could queue on local sockets, was flawed. A user
    given a local socket opened by another user, for example through the
    systemd socket activation mechanism, could make use of the other
    user's quota, again leading to a denial-of-service (resource
    exhaustion). This is fixed by accounting queued files to the sender
    rather than the socket opener.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u3. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by CVE-2015-8830.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4. CVE-2015-7566, CVE-2015-8767 and
CVE-2016-0723 were already fixed in DSA-3448-1. CVE-2016-0774 does not
affect the stable distribution.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user\_struct

```
The commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
be credited.

To do so, we add a reference counted struct user_struct pointer to the
scm_fp_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

# USN-2946-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

6 April 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux

Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect

system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](/security/CVE-2016-2085))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file

descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over

a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](/security/CVE-2016-2550))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-85-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-85.129~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-85.129~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-85-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-85.129~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-85.129~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-2948-2: Linux kernel (Utopic HWE) regression

11 April 2016

USN 2948-1 introduced a regression in the Ubuntu 14.10 Linux kernel
backported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic for Trusty

## Details

USN-2948-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu 14.10 Linux kernel

backported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. An incorrect reference counting

fix in the radeon driver introduced a regression that could cause a

system crash. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux

Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect

system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](/security/CVE-2016-2085))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file

descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over

a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](/security/CVE-2016-2550))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-3.16.0-70-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-utopic)
  -
  [3.16.0-70.90~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-utopic/3.16.0-70.90~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Subject: CVE Request: Linux: unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending
 process user_struct sockets

Hi,

A new (denial-of-service) issue was fixed in Linux introduced by the
commit 712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593[1], which was part of
commits to address CVE-2013-4312.

David Herrmann reported that the original commit "incorrectly
accounted the number of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the
original opener of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to
arbitrary deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the
maximum of open files."

This was fixed in 415e3d3e90ce9e18727e8843ae343eda5a58fad6[2].

Can you please assign a CVE for this issue?

 [1] <https://git.kernel.org/linus/712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593> (v4.5-rc1)
 [2] <https://git.kernel.org/linus/415e3d3e90ce9e18727e8843ae343eda5a58fad6> (v4.5-rc4)

Regards,
Salvatore

# USN-2947-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

6 April 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux

Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect

system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](/security/CVE-2016-2085))

It was discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not correctly compute branch offsets

for backward jumps after ctx expansion. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-2383](/security/CVE-2016-2383))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file

descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over

a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](/security/CVE-2016-2550))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-35-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-35.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-35.40)

  -
  [4.2.0-35.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-35.40)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-35-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-35.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-35.40)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-35-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-35.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-35.40)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
