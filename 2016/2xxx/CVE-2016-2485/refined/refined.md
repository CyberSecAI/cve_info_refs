Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-2485:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the processing of audio data within the `(gsm|g711)dec` codecs of Mediaserver.
- A buffer overflow occurs because the code doesn't properly check the size of the OMX (OpenMAX) buffer before using it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to insufficient size validation.
- **Insufficient Validation:** The code fails to validate the size of the OMX buffer before usage, leading to potential memory corruption when processing specially crafted audio data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege**: A successful exploit could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of an elevated system application (Mediaserver), which is a highly privileged process having access to audio/video streams and other restricted resources.
- This vulnerability can be used to gain access to elevated capabilities, such as "Signature" or "SignatureOrSystem" permissions, which are not accessible to third-party apps.
- **Remote code execution**: The provided description also indicates that Mediaserver vulnerabilities are exploitable using remote content such as MMS or browser playback of media. Although this particular vulnerability is not explicitly described as a remote code execution, the context indicates that it falls into that category,

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability after gaining initial access to the device.
- **Remote Exploitation:** Due to Mediaserver's handling of remote content, vulnerabilities in this component are reachable via attack vectors such as MMS messages, web browsing and media playback.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Malicious App:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- **Ability to Trigger the vulnerable code path**: The attacker has to craft an audio file that, when processed, triggers the buffer overflow during decoding.
- **MMS/Browser Interaction**: For remote exploitation, the attacker needs to send a crafted file or trigger a vulnerable webpage.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check for the OMX buffer size before using it in the `(gsm|g711)dec` codecs.
- This vulnerability is rated as High severity.
