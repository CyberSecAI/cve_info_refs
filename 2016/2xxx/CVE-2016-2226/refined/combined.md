| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c0)  Marcel Böhme    2016-02-05 10:41:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 37592](attachment.cgi?id=37592 "Test Case #1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=37592&action=edit "Test Case #1") Test Case #1  The attached program binary causes a buffer overflow in cplus-dem.c when it tries to demangle specially crafted function arguments in the binary. Both the buffer size as well as the buffer content are controlled from the binary.  objdump -x -C <file> nm -C <file>  Tested on the following configurations * 2.6.32-573.7.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Sep 22 22:00:00 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux * 4.1.12-boot2docker #1 SMP Tue Nov 3 06:03:36 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux * Binutils versions: 2.20 and 2.26  Best regards, - Marcel  Backlink: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19571> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c1)  Marcel Böhme    2016-02-05 10:42:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 37593](attachment.cgi?id=37593 "Test Case #2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=37593&action=edit "Test Case #2") Test Case #2 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c2)  Markus Trippelsdorf    2016-02-05 10:52:06 UTC  ``` I don't think it makes much sense to fuzz the demangler with arbitrary binary files. This isn't some daemon that runs 24/7 and is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c3)  Marcel Böhme    2016-02-05 11:18:18 UTC  ``` Hi Markus,  Indeed, it depends on the use case. I find it quite unsettling to know that common digital forensics tools, such as gdb and objdump, are vulnerable to execute arbitrary code.  How much credibility would a virus scanner have that installs a virus only because it *scanned* a malicious software?  Best regards, - Marcel ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c4)  Marcel Böhme    2016-02-05 16:07:16 UTC  ``` Here is my preliminary analysis: The function demangle_args (cplus-dem.c:4424) parses the (crafted) mangled function args from the binary. In line 4452, r is read from mangled. In line 4491, we enter a loop with r iterations. In line 4498, arg is parsed from mangled (always from the same region). In each loop iteration arg is appended to decl, such that the length of decl grows in each iteration.  The function string_appends (cplus-dem.c:4820) appends string arg to string decl. In line 4827, it uses string_need to check whether sufficient memory is allocated in decl to append arg. Then, it memcopies whatever is in arg to the end of decl.  The function string_need (cplus-dem.c:4751) checks whether sufficient memory is available to append size-of-arg more characters. If not, xrealloc decl with n=2*(length of decl + length of arg) characters. Since n is a signed int, n wraps over at some iteration. Since, realloc expects n to be unsigned, we end up allocating less memory then actually needed. In the beginning though n is too large and xrealloc simply complains. However, if you play a bit with the length of arg, you'll quickly turn that integer overflow in a buffer overflow. Later, string_appends will memcopy whatever arg contains.  In our simple test case the relevant bits in the binary are specified the binary (arbitrarily): r = 80000000, arg = "A______wwww\235\235\235_N____" of length 020.  A particularly malicious attacker could craft an executable that executes when *analysed* by objdump, nm or gdb, or any other libbfd / libiberty - based forensics tool (if the demangling option is switched on).  -- Marcel Böhme Postdoctoral Researcher TSUNAMi Security Research Lab National University of Singapore ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c5)  Marcel Böhme    2016-02-06 17:20:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 37612](attachment.cgi?id=37612 "Debug This") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=37612&action=edit "Debug This") Debug This ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c6)  Manuel López-Ibáñez    2016-02-07 01:33:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcel Böhme from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c5)) > Created [attachment 37612](attachment.cgi?id=37612 "Debug This") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=37612&action=edit "Debug This") > Debug This  Scary. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c7)  Marcel Böhme    2016-02-07 07:04:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 37620](attachment.cgi?id=37620 "Valgrind This") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=37620&action=edit "Valgrind This") Valgrind This  $ cat compileme.c #include<stdio.h> #include<stdlib.h>  const char* ____________________X00020A___R0020A__U000R03000N99999999_020A__K000(){   char *p;   p = (char *) malloc(19);   p = (char *) malloc(12);   free(p);   p = (char *) malloc(16);   return "Hello World!"; }  int main() {    printf("%s\n",____________________X00020A___R0020A__U000R03000N99999999_020A__K000());    return 0; }  $ g++ compileme.c -o temp $ sed -b s/Z68/_20/g temp > valgrindme $ chmod u+x valgrindme $ ./valgrindme Hello World! $ valgrind --leak-check=yes ./valgrindme .. $ gdb ./valgrindme .. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c8)  Marcel Böhme    2016-02-10 14:35:57 UTC  ``` Downstream: * Valgrind: <https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=359181> * GDB: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19597> * Binutils: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19571> ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c9)  Marcel Böhme    2016-03-02 08:02:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 37839](attachment.cgi?id=37839&action=diff "Proposed Patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=37839&action=edit "Proposed Patch") Proposed Patch  * Limiting the length of the mangled string to 264k characters. * Limiting the loop iterations to 256 (max. of C++ function parameters). ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c10)  Markus Trippelsdorf    2016-03-02 08:22:55 UTC  ``` Patches should be posted to: gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=69687#c11)  Manuel López-Ibáñez    2016-03-02 20:45:16 UTC  ``` The policy of GNU software is to avoid arbitrary implementation limits whenever possible.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c0)  Marcel Böhme    2016-03-31 14:40:56 UTC  ``` In the most recent version, Valgrind reports an invalid write of size 8 due to a use-after-free if the demangler is called with a certain class signature. However, the demangling succeeds in earlier versions.  How to Reproduce: binutils-2.26# valgrind binutils/cxxfilt _Q10-__9cafebabe. ==56086== Memcheck, a memory error detector ==56086== Copyright (C) 2002-2013, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al. ==56086== Using Valgrind-3.10.1 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info ==56086== Command: binutils/cxxfilt _Q10-__9cafebabe. ==56086==  ==56086== Invalid write of size 8 ==56086==    at 0x787D9B: remember_Ktype (cplus-dem.c:4300) ==56086==    by 0x787D9B: demangle_class (cplus-dem.c:2621) ==56086==    by 0x787D9B: demangle_signature (cplus-dem.c:1494) ==56086==    by 0x78DEA9: internal_cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:1204) ==56086==    by 0x75DC6A: cplus_demangle (cplus-dem.c:887) ==56086==    by 0x4063E1: demangle_it (cxxfilt.c:62) ==56086==    by 0x4059BE: main (cxxfilt.c:227) ..  The root cause: There is a variable ksize storing the amount of allocated memory for the array. ksize being zero (0) indicates that some memory must be allocated upon the first write. When more memory is needed, both ksize and the memory are doubled during reallocation. At some point the memory for the array is freed but the value of ksize remains. Since ksize is not 0, there is no indication that new memory must be allocated when there is another write to the array.  The solution: When freeing the memory of the array set ksize=0.  I am preparing a patch. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c1)  Mikhail Maltsev    2016-03-31 15:02:11 UTC  ``` Likely a dup of [PR67394](show_bug.cgi?id=67394 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - crash due to null pointer deref in demangle_signature()") ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c2)  Marcel Böhme    2016-03-31 15:36:04 UTC  ``` These are two distinct bugs. During fuzzing the btypevec bug appears more often. But it seemed less critical since only NULL is written to the freed memory: work -> btypevec[ret] = NULL;  On the other hand, the ktypevec bug allows to write arbitrary content to the freed memory: work -> ktypevec[work -> numk++] = tem; where tem is "cafebabe."  I used a more efficient version of the AFL fuzzer. Interestingly, I submitted the same patch: <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-03/msg01687.html> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=70481#c3)  Jeffrey A.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

> 1) Exploitable Buffer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

As far as we can tell, you sent a CVE request for this vulnerability
to cve-assign@...re.org (from a different email address of yours) on
2016-02-05, and we replied with a CVE ID on 2016-02-06. Is there an
additional aspect of 69687 that you are reporting now?

Our reply at that time was:

  > <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69687>

  >> Since n is a signed int, n wraps over at some iteration. Since,
  >> realloc expects n to be unsigned, we end up allocating less memory
  >> then actually needed. In the beginning though n is too large and
  >> xrealloc simply complains. However, if you play a bit with the length
  >> of arg, you'll quickly turn that integer overflow in a buffer
  >> overflow.

  Use CVE-2016-2226 for this incorrect handling of a signed int.

> 2) Invalid Write due to a Use-After-Free (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70481>

Comment 2 says "two distinct bugs."

Use CVE-2016-4487 for the btypevec bug.

Use CVE-2016-4488 for the ktypevec bug.

> 3) Invalid Write due to Integer Overflow (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70492>

Use CVE-2016-4489.

> 4) Write Access Violation (Fixed in GCC trunk)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70498>

Use CVE-2016-4490 for this issue described as "Root cause: In
cp-demangle.c sometimes length-variables are of type long ... Other
times they are of type int."

Note that this CVE ID is not about the Comment 1 "case where
consume_count returns -1" -- that comment does not belong in 70498 at
all.

> 5) Various Stack Corruptions (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70909>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00105>

Use CVE-2016-4491 for this issue caused by a lack of checking for "has
itself as ancestor more than once."

> 6) Write Access Violation (Patch under Review)
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70926>
> <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-05/threads.html#00223>

Use CVE-2016-4492 for both of the "first read the value of a length
variable len from the mangled string, then strncpy len characters from
the mangled string; more than necessary" issues.

Use CVE-2016-4493 for both of the "read the value of an array index n
from the mangled string, which can be negative due to an overflow"
issues.
