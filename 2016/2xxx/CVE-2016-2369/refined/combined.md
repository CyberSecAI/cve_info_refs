# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0137

## Pidgin MXIT CP\_SOCK\_REC\_TERM Denial of Service Vulnerability

##### June 21, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-2369

### DESCRIPTION

An NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in a denial of service vulnerability. A malicious server can send a packet starting with a NULL byte triggering the vulnerability.

### CVSS v3 SCORE

5.9 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### TESTED VERSIONS

Pidgin 2.10.11

### PRODUCT URLs

https://www.pidgin.im/

### DETAILS

The function mxit\_parse\_packet() in mxit/protocol.c is called when data is received from an MXIT server to parse the relevant stream of bytes into an MXIT packet.

When the packet is received, a new record is created in the packet to reflect the data (near line 2672):

```
rec = NULL;
field = NULL;
memset( &packet, 0x00, sizeof( struct rx_packet ) );
	rec = add_record( &packet );

```

The function add\_record does the following:

```
static struct record* add_record( struct rx_packet* p )
{
	struct record*	rec;
	rec = g_new0( struct record, 1 );
	p->records = g_realloc( p->records,
	sizeof( struct record* ) * ( p->rcount + 1 ) );
	p->records[p->rcount] = rec;
	p->rcount++;

	return rec;
}

```

This will create a record in the packet and increase the rcount variable by 1.

At lines 2679-2744 the packet is further analyzed and broken up into records and fields depending on if the separator being used is 0x0, 0x1 or 0x2.

The following code if of particular interest:

```
while ( ( i < session->rx_i ) && ( !pbreak ) ) {
	switch ( session->rx_dbuf[i] ) {
		case CP_SOCK_REC_TERM :
			/* new record */
			if ( packet.rcount == 1 ) {
				/* packet command */
				packet.cmd = atoi( packet.records[0]->fields[0]->data );
			}

```

The value CP\_SOCK\_REC\_TERM indicates that the end of a record is reached and it will retrieve the command that the packet is sending. However, if the packet starts with a NULL byte then the fields value for the record will not have been initialized resulting in a crash when trying to dereference it at line 2686.

# Pidgin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-38**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Pidgin, the worst of
which could lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/pidgin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.0** |

### Background

Pidgin is a client for a variety of instant messaging protocols.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker might send specially crafted data using the MXit
protocol, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, or in
leaking confidential information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Pidgin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/pidgin-2.11.0"

```

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [libpurple0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.10.11-0ubuntu4.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.10.11-0ubuntu4.2)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libpurple0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.10.9-0ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.10.9-0ubuntu3.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

  -
  [1:2.10.3-0ubuntu1.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.10.3-0ubuntu1.7)

After a standard system update you need to restart Pidgin to make all the

necessary changes.

Yves Younan of Cisco Talos discovered several vulnerabilities in the
MXit protocol support in pidgin, a multi-protocol instant messaging
client. A remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a
denial of service (application crash), overwrite files, information
disclosure, or potentially to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.0-0+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.11.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.
