# CAPI shouldn't allow users to create apps with routes matching CF service subdomains #568

## Description

[![@djvdorp](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827540?v=4&size=48)](/djvdorp)[djvdorp](https://github.com/djvdorp)opened [on Mar 23, 2016](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/issues/568#issue-142965271)

Today we stumbled upon a very interesting bug within CAPI, which I spoke about with [@nebhale](https://github.com/nebhale) on the CloudFoundry (Open Source) Slack.

We were experiencing HTTP 404 errors approximately ~50% of the time when connecting to the UAA via the CF CLI. We also had similar errors with one of our internal services using the [cf-java-client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client), which gave us errors such as `Error requesting access token.`

Turns out that one of our users has created an app with route `login.ourdomain.ext`, and that caused this behaviour. Since you can have multiple apps with the same domain bound on it, CF is nicely load-balancing traffic to the 'real' `login.ourdomain.ext` (the UAA) and the user's app, which makes this fail the ~50% of the time my CF CLI or `cf-java-client` hits the user's app instead of the actual UAA.

In our case, the user was not a malicious user, but it would be pretty straight forward to inject a “Yes Always” application that listens on the same route as the UAA, which would then catch/receive UAA (OAuth) tokens.

In the case of the `cf-java-client` (and also the CF CLI) I think it makes sense they don't block this kind of behaviour, as they will just act as a pure passthrough for anything you request. However, I believe that CF should block the ability to use the same route as the UAA though for security reasons.

In a default (stock) CF-release installation, we believe this should (probably) at least be blocked for these CF service subdomains, if this has not already been done:

* api.ourdomain.ext
* uaa.ourdomain.ext / login.ourdomain.ext
* hm9000.ourdomain.ext
* loggregator.ourdomain.ext
* doppler.ourdomain.ext

We think that this might be a CAPI (security) issue. [@nebhale](https://github.com/nebhale) will also ask [@jbayer](https://github.com/jbayer) about this in person.
