  "CVE-2016-2774": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ISC DHCP server does not effectively limit the number of simultaneous open TCP connections to the ports the server uses for inter-process communications and control (OMAPI and failover ports).",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Resource consumption vulnerability due to lack of limit on open TCP connections.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can interfere with DHCP server operation by opening a large number of TCP connections, leading to denial of service. This could result in the server exiting unexpectedly, becoming unresponsive, or exhausting system sockets.",
      "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker can open multiple TCP connections to the DHCP server's OMAPI or failover ports.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the DHCP server and the ability to establish TCP connections."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DHCP server does not restrict the number of concurrent TCP sessions on OMAPI port.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of restriction on the number of open TCP connections.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "Opening many concurrent TCP connections to the OMAPI port.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote network access."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DHCP server does not effectively limit the number of simultaneous open TCP connections to OMAPI and failover ports.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of a limit on the number of open TCP connections.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause dhcpd to exit unexpectedly, stop responding to requests, or exhaust system sockets.",
       "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker able to establish TCP connections to one of the OMAPI or failover ports.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote network access."
