  "CVE-2016-2545": {
    "description": "The snd_timer_interrupt function in sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.1 does not properly maintain a certain linked list, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (race condition and system crash) via a crafted ioctl call.",

When snd_timer_stop() is called later, it attempts to remove the object from the list again, resulting in a double unlink.",
