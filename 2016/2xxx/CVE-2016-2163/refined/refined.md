Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating events, specifically within the event description field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code within event descriptions. This code is then stored and executed when users view the event details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers when they view the event details.
- **Potential for account compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions depending on the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to create an event with a malicious URL (e.g. `javascript:alert('xss')`) in the event description field.
- The malicious code is executed when a user clicks on the crafted link present in the event details.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create events within the application.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text also indicates that the actual link is not visible to the end user, increasing the likelihood of successful exploitation.
- The vulnerability affects Apache OpenMeetings versions from 1.9.x before 3.1.1.
