Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-2200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Insufficient Control Flow Management:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate handling of control flow within the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU when processing specially crafted packets on port 102/TCP (ISO/TSAP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management):** This is the primary weakness, where the system does not properly manage the sequence of operations.
*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**: The Siemens advisory identifies improper input validation as the CWE associated to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition.
*   **CPU Stop Mode:** The affected CPU automatically restarts and enters STOP mode.
*   **Manual Recovery:** Manual intervention is required to restore the CPU to RUN mode.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited via network by sending specially crafted packets to port 102/TCP (ISO/TSAP).
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the affected device on port 102/TCP.
*   **Low Skill Level:** An attacker with low technical skill could exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   **CVSS v3 Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 with vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
*   **Affected Products:** Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family, versions prior to Version 1.8.3
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to firmware version 1.8.3.
*   **Exploit Availability:** No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

The Siemens advisory provides additional information, including the fact that the vulnerability was discovered and coordinated by Lexfo and the CVSS 3.1 vector which includes Exploitability and Remediation Level.
