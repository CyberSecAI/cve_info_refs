# Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-040-02

## OVERVIEW

Siemens has identified two vulnerabilities in the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family. Siemens has produced a firmware update to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU versions are affected:

* Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family, versions prior to Version 1.8.3

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a denial-of-service condition or a replay attack on the affected devices.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Siemens is a multinational company headquartered in Munich, Germany.

The affected products, the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family, are designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments. According to Siemens, the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture, and Chemical. Siemens estimates that these products are used worldwide.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### INSUFFICIENT CONTROL FLOW MANAGEMENTCWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/691.html, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.

Specially crafted packets sent to Port 102/TCP (ISO/TSAP) could cause a denial-of-service condition on affected devices. The CPU will automatically restart and remain in STOP mode. To recover from this condition, the CPU needs to be manually put into RUN mode again.

CVE-2016-2200NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2200, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.

### PREDICTABILITY PROBLEMSCWE-340: Predictability Problems, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/340.html, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.

The replay protection efficiency at Port 102/TCP (ISO/TSAP) of the affected devices could be reduced by remote attackers under certain conditions.

CVE-2016-2201NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2201, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.7 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N, web site last accessed February 9, 2016.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with low skill would be able to exploit one of these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Siemens has released SIMATIC S7-1500 firmware Version 1.8.3, which addresses the identified vulnerabilities and recommends that users update to the new firmware version, which is available at the following URL:

<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/de/en/view/109478459>.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends that users protect network access to SIMATIC S7-1500 CPUs. Siemens advises users to configure the host environment according to operational guidelines, provided in the following URL:

<https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>.

Siemens security advisory, SSA-253230, is available at the following URL:

<https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>.

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any speciﬁc mitigations or workarounds.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

SSA-253230

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-2200

Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp (ISO/TSAP) could cause a Denial-of-Service condition
on the affected devices. The CPU will automatically restart and remain in STOP mode. To recover
from this condition the CPU needs to be manually put into RUN mode again.
