Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Kernel Mode Driver Escape interface layer of NVIDIA Windows GPU drivers, which allows the use of an untrusted pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Usage of an untrusted pointer in the kernel driver's escape interface. This can lead to the access of uninitialized or out-of-bounds memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can result in:
    - Information disclosure.
    - System crashes.
    - Denial of service.
    - Potential escalation of privilege.
- Increased risk of malicious code accessing privileged resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all NVIDIA GPU products on Windows, not specific to any GPU class.
-  The exploit is confirmed to be functional.
- The provided CVSS metrics:
    - Base Score: 7.2
    - Exploitability Sub-score: 3.9
    - Impact Sub-score: 10
    - Temporal Score: 6.0
    - Access Vector: Local
    - Access Complexity: Low
    - Authentication: None
    - Confidentiality Impact: Complete
