- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software uses outdated and insecure cryptographic algorithms for hashing passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of outdated hashing algorithms like MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, ECB, RC4, export ciphers, SSLv2, SSLv3, and DH using keys less than 1024 bits.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user could potentially obtain and decrypt user credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system is required.
