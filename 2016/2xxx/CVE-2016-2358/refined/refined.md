Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-2358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Milesight IP cameras have hard-coded default credentials. Specifically, they come with three default users, and also include seven additional users with blank usernames and blank passwords. These blank user accounts have the highest authority level (authority bit set to zero).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded default credentials:** The existence of multiple user accounts with empty usernames and passwords by default creates a significant security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Control of Camera:** Attackers can gain full control of the camera without requiring a username or password by utilizing these blank user accounts if they can directly interact with the device's user database.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The blank user accounts bypass the authentication mechanism and provide privileged access to the camera.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** While the web interface has a JavaScript check to prevent creating users with blank usernames/passwords, direct access to the underlying system or camera configuration allows exploitation of the blank user accounts by modifying the user database directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **System-Level Access:** Attackers need to interact directly with the camera's system or configuration file to access and utilize the blank user accounts. This requires bypassing the web interface.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers may need network access to reach the camera's web interface, or may need to be on the local network to access the camera directly.
