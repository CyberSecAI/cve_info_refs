    "description": "The graphite2::TtfUtil::CmapSubtable12Lookup function in TtfUtil.cpp in Graphite 2 before 1.3.6, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 45.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.7, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Graphite smart font.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer over-read in the graphite2::TtfUtil::CmapSubtable12Lookup function within the Graphite 2 library.",
