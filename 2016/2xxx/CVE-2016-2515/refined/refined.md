{
  "CVE-2016-2515": {
    "description": "The nodejs-hawk library is vulnerable to a minor denial of service. By providing long headers or URIs, an attacker can cause the application to perform excessive string matching operations, leading to a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation and length limitations on the processing of headers and URIs within the nodejs-hawk library. Specifically, the library uses regular expressions to match patterns in the input, and excessively long input strings cause the regex engine to consume excessive resources.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Lack of length limitations",
        "Inefficient regex processing"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (DoS). The targeted application would become unresponsive due to the excessive resource consumption during string matching operations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with long headers",
      "Sending specially crafted requests with long URIs containing a bewit parameter"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application. No other special capabilities or privileges are needed."
