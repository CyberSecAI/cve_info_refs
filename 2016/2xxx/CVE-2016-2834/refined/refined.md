Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2834:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references "CVE-2016-2834" in multiple sources, including SUSE and Red Hat bug trackers, and the SUSE CVE page itself. The descriptions align with the official CVE description indicating memory safety issues in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS).

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Memory safety bugs in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS). Specifically, multiple buffer handling flaws in how NSS processes cryptographic data from the network were identified. Also, a missing NULL check in `PK11_SignWithSymKey` / `ssl3_ComputeRecordMACConstantTime`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Memory corruption vulnerabilities due to improper handling of cryptographic data.
    *   Use-after-free issues.
    *   Out-of-bounds write issues
    *   Missing null check leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
    *   Integer division miscalculation leading to a weakening of cryptography.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service (application crash).
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application using NSS.
    *   Possible information disclosure.
    *   Potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers sending crafted network traffic.
    *   Exploitation via a malicious website and crafted web content (WebGL, Java applets).
    *   Exploitation by providing malicious certificates for parsing.
    *   Exploitation via maliciously crafted Diffie-Hellman keys during TLS handshake.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send crafted network traffic to a server using NSS.
    *   Ability to trick a user into visiting a malicious website with crafted content (e.g. WebGL/Java).
    *   No authentication required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before version 3.23
*   Affects Mozilla Firefox before version 47.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.2

**Additional Notes:**

*   The SUSE vulnerability page also includes CVSS v2 and v3 scores that differ, providing some nuance on attack complexity.
*   SUSE notes a lower CVSS score, possibly due to their interpretation of the attack surface or mitigation. The upstream CVSS scoring is higher.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in NSS 3.23.
*   The Suse bugzilla entry includes many comments related to fixing the issue within their environment.
*   The RedHat bugzilla entry suggests that there were also issues with a missing null check in `PK11_SignWithSymKey` / `ssl3_ComputeRecordMACConstantTime`, which could also cause a server crash if the attacker was able to exploit the issue.
*   The mozilla bugzilla entries provides additional context on how the bug was identified along with the commits that fixed the bug in NSS.
