{
  "CVE-2016-2782": {
    "description": "The treo_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that lacks a (1) bulk-in or (2) interrupt-in endpoint",
    "root_cause": "The treo_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c does not properly validate the existence of bulk-in or interrupt-in endpoints in a USB device descriptor, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physically proximate attacker",
	  "Crafted USB device"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the vulnerable system to insert a crafted USB device."
