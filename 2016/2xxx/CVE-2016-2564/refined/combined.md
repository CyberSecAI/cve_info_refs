* Released 03/21/2016
* Current release: No
* Beta release: No
* Soft release: No

This release fixes reported issues from clients in our bug tracker and support tickets and adds refinement to existing features.

**New or Changed Features**

* When your link auto-embeds in a post such as with an image, YouTube video, Twitter link, etc. an option will now display to revert the embed back to a plain text link if you do not want the embed.
* New setting to disable embedding.
* Facebook/Twitter integration improvements
* If you are an administrator and encounter a system error, additional debug output will now display. Regular members will see the normal error message.
* Custom Fields for Support Requests in Commerce now show on the front-end.
* If an advertisement is set up with a main image, but not smaller images for tablets/mobiles, the ad would not show at all on tablets/mobiles. This has changed so the main image will display on all devices unless smaller images are provided.
* Topics scheduled to automatically lock or unlock will now reflect this in the topic listing and when viewing the topic.
* Placing a link to a Facebook status will embed when possible.
* When viewing a report, the container (for example, the forum) the content is from is displayed.
* Three character searches are now allowed in the Admin CP Live Search.
* The Account Settings page now uses vertical rather than horizontal tabs to prevent overflow.
* If Gravatar is enabled, and a user has not defined an profile photo, then their email address will be used to fetch from Gravatar unless explicitly set not to.
* Gfycat embeds now use their oEmbed endpoint rather than their JS API.
* Using Amazon CloudFront as https provider will now be recognized as valid secure connection.
* The member REST API endpoint will now return custom fields.
* The Developer Center for Plugins now shows the filename in the list of hooks, and when editing a hook, a breadcrumb includes a link back to the list.
* Inline notifications can now be dismissed
* Efficiency improvements to the search index
* You can now close a poll independently of the topic

**Important Fixes**

In addition to dozens of smaller fixes this release includes fixes for the follow items that impacted many clients:

* Several security enhancements.
* The posting parser has been made more efficient.
* Some BBCode does not parse correctly in version 4 and we have applied some fixes for this. In general BBCode is deprecated so we only provide basic support.
* Sitemaps could sometimes be blank if there was no content in a specific section.
* Certain URLs from version 3 were not redirecting properly to the new version 4 format.
* The timezone detection is now more robust and will more gracefully fail if it cannot determine a visitor's timezone.
* Permission matrices have been reworked to send less data to prevent exceeding server limitations.
* Decimal handling has been reworked in Commerce for more precise calculations.
* The database class now handles InnoDB deadlocks more gracefully, and some queries have been changed to reduce the likeliness of deadlocks.
* Performance improvements to areas which perform large updates on the members table (for example, when editing permissions).
* Pages 'number' custom fields previously had an upper limit for submitted values around 2 billion.
* Multiple fixes for tag searching

---

This is a security release and we recommend all clients upgrade as soon as possible.

**Security Enhancements:**

1. Some potential issues have been brought to our attention with MD5 checks within the suite, including:
   1. In very specific situations, it can be possible to trick certain MD5 checks in to passing when the supplied MD5 hash does not actually match.
   2. Due to the way PHP compares strings, it is theoretically be possible under very controlled conditions to brute-force certain MD5 checks by measuring the response time.
   3. When logging out or changing one's password, the key used to automatically authorize a user on subsequent visits was not appropriately reset, meaning if someone had access to a machine you had previously logged in on (but not logged in again since you logged out), it may have been possible to reclaim the session.
   4. In addition to the above, we have also added additional entropy to the generation of certain hashes.

   While these issues are mostly theoretical in nature, they have been addressed in 4.1.9. We would like to thank [Ian Carroll](https://twitter.com/iangcarroll) for bringing these issues to our attention. We do not use MD5 hashing as part of our password checking so none of these issues apply to the method used for password encryption.
2. We have resolved an XSS vulnerability. Though we employ techniques to limit the damage possible with XSS vulnerabilities, they can be used to cause annoyance and for social engineering attacks. We would like to thank [LinusMediaGroup](https://linustechtips.com/main/) for bringing this issue to our attention.
3. We have added *noopener* and *noreferrer* to the *rel* attribute on outgoing links to alleviate certain types of social engineering attacks.
4. We have resolved an issue where under certain circumstances users could delete attachments without permission. We would like to thank <https://www.malwarebytes.org/> for bringing this issue to our attention.

**Activity Stream Improvements**

The activity stream has a new toggle and filter bar that replaces the "Edit Form" link. It is now faster and easier to customize existing streams and to change the filtering options without having to create new streams.

**Example of "un-embed" option**

**Facebook/Twitter integration improvements**

* If signed in with Facebook or Twitter, when posting a status update, a checkbox to share on these services appears instead of the old setting to export statuses in the account settings panel. This change ensures IPS4 conforms with Facebook's Terms & Conditions and will pass Facebook's App Review.
* When setting up Facebook integration, a new setting allows disabling status imports so you do not need to go through Facebook's App Review if you only want to allow users to sign in with Facebook and not integrate with status updates.
* When setting up Facebook or Twitter integration, the setting to allow automatic sharing is shown in addition to in the sharing settings so it is easier to enable this feature.
* Facebook integration has been updated to use their latest API endpoints.

A new guide will be available after 4.1.9's release to explain in detail how to go through Facebook's App Review process

# Summary

I discovered a potential issue with how Invision Power Board generates its session cookies, which could lead to the compromise of user sessions or the cron key. It was reported and assigned CVE-2016–2564 on 02/25/2016, fixed on 2/26/2016, and the update with the fix was released on 3/21/2016 in version 4.1.9. As far as I am aware, it was present in all 4.0 releases and all releases prior to 4.1.9.

4.1.9 fixed a few other security issues reported by me in the suite, including:

* Timing-unsafe comparison of the cron key used in the web-exposed cron runner.
* A type conversion issue when comparing MD5 hashes in the web-exposed cron runner, when the auto-generated cron key was a [“magic hash”](https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/magic-hashes/).
* It was impossible to re-generate the session cookie for a given user, even if the password was changed or all sessions were logged out of.
* The generic encryption class uses `md5(sql\_password . sql\_database\_name)` for deriving an AES key, as well as for the IPS Connect master key. **This was not resolved.**

# Exploitation

Invision Power Board takes the MD5 hash of the result of `uniqid()` , and uses this for various random keys. Most critically, the session key used to identify a user from the cookie uses this method. As the documentation for `uniqid()` warns, “This function does not generate cryptographically secure values, and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.”

`uniqid()` is worse than the manual makes it out to be. An example return value is `58fc30c53db63` . Already, this is only <7 bytes of entropy. But it becomes worse, because without the `more_entropy` flag set, PHP only uses the current time to generate the return value, as seen in the PHP source code:

```
sec = (int) tv.tv_sec;
usec = (int) (tv.tv_usec % 0x100000);if (more_entropy) {
    uniqid = strpprintf(0, "%s%08x%05x%.8F", prefix, sec, usec, php_combined_lcg() * 10);
 } else {
    uniqid = strpprintf(0, "%s%08x%05x", prefix, sec, usec);
}
```

The first four bytes are the current UNIX timestamp, and the last 20 bits are derived from the current time in microseconds.

This gives a bit less than 2²⁰, or one million, possible results per given second. If you are able to predict when a new session key is generated for a user, you can guess their key with a decent number of requests, depending on how accurate your guess is. On a popular forum, you may not even need to target a specific user, as the number of users logging in at one time may be large enough.

Someone with the ability to sniff the timing of encrypted traffic may be able to perform this attack with a much lower number of requests.

# Resolution

Invision Power Board chose to simply flip the `more_entropy` flag. This is still dangerous, but much harder to exploit. As seen above, this utilizes PHP’s internal LCG, which is an insecure RNG, but many more guesses are required, and are likely remotely impractical.

A better resolution would be to use `random_bytes(32)` , and ship the [permissively licensed polyfill](https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat) for it, written by [Scott Arciszewski](https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder). They did not provide a reason for choosing not to use this.

It is worth noting that something may have changed in terms of their resolution between March of 2016 and today, but since I have not paid $35 to renew my license, I am incapable of checking.
