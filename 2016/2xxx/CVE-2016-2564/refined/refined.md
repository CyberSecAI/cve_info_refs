{
  "CVE-2016-2564": {
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in Invision Power Board (IPB) where the session key generation is predictable due to the usage of `uniqid()` without the `more_entropy` flag, leading to potential session hijacking.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of `uniqid()` function without the `more_entropy` parameter, which results in predictable session key generation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Predictable session key generation.",
        "Use of MD5 hashes with limited entropy.",
        "Insecure random number generator (RNG) usage by relying on `uniqid()` without more_entropy"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker could potentially hijack user sessions by predicting session keys, possibly gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially the cron key.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network sniffing to observe encrypted traffic timing and session key generation.",
        "Brute-forcing session keys based on predictable patterns within `uniqid()` output."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to predict when a session key is generated for a user.",
        "Network access to intercept or observe traffic to and from the vulnerable server",
		"Ability to make multiple requests to attempt to hijack a session."
      ]
    },
    "additional_details": {
      "resolution": "The issue was addressed by enabling the `more_entropy` flag in `uniqid()`, which, while not ideal, significantly increases the difficulty of predicting session keys. A better solution would have been to use `random_bytes(32)`",
      "affected_versions": "All Invision Power Board 4.0 releases and all releases prior to 4.1.9."
    }
