- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input leading to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send malformed HTTP requests by persuading an authenticated user to visit a malicious website. This can lead to cross-site scripting attacks, Web cache poisoning, and other malicious activities, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker persuades an authenticated user to visit a malicious website, which then sends a malformed HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious website. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP request. The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable system or network.
