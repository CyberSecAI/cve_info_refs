Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2826:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way the Mozilla Windows updater handles file extraction from MAR archives. Specifically, the files extracted by the updater are not locked for writing, which allows other processes to overwrite them while the updater is running.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  *   **Unprotected File Extraction:** The core issue is that extracted files are not protected against modification by other processes. This creates a race condition where a malicious program can interfere with the update process.
  *  **Junction Circumvention:**  The updater's path validation doesn't properly handle junctions, allowing an attacker to use junctions to access and modify files outside the intended update directory. This bypasses the intended path restrictions of the updater.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  *   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the system by manipulating the update process. This allows to replace legitimate files with malicious ones.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If the overwritten files are later invoked by other Windows components with higher privileges, the attacker could achieve privilege escalation, gaining elevated control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
  *   **Local Malicious Program:** An attacker needs a malicious program running on the victim's machine.
  *   **Windows Updater Invocation:**  The attacker's program invokes the Mozilla Windows updater.
  *   **Race Condition:** The malicious program exploits the race condition during file extraction by the updater to overwrite files.
    *   **Junction Creation:** The attacker utilizes junctions to overwrite files in arbitrary locations, including protected areas like `c:\windows`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   *   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This can be achieved through various means, such as social engineering, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or having prior access.
   *   **No Administrative Privileges Required initially** The attack does not require admin rights to start, only to write to the protected locations.

**Additional Details:**
   * The provided Bugzilla entry ([Bug 1237219](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1237219)) includes a detailed description of the exploit, the proof of concept, and the source code used to demonstrate the vulnerability.
   * The fix for this vulnerability involves locking the patch file during the update process to prevent other processes from modifying it.

This detailed information is consistent with the official description of CVE-2016-2826 and provides more in-depth technical details.
