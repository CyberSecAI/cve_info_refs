  "response": {
    "match": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default number of iterations for the `PBKDF2PasswordHasher` and its subclasses has increased in each major version of Django since 1.6. This creates a timing difference during login requests between users with passwords encoded with older iterations and non-existent users. The `BasePasswordHasher.harden_runtime()` method was introduced to bridge this timing gap.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Timing attack due to variations in password hashing work factors",
      "User enumeration through timing differences"

      "Remote attack via login requests"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the vulnerable application. No specific user privileges are required."
