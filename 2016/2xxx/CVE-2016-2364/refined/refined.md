Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-2364:

**Root Cause:**
The HUDweb plugin for Google Chrome contains a Thawte-signed SSL certificate and private key that is hard-coded and shared across all installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The private key is embedded within the plugin instead of being generated or managed securely. This is a cryptographic weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded private key can conduct:
    - Impersonation attacks
    - Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
    - Passive decryption attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation relies on the attacker having possession of the shared, hard-coded private key.
- This could be achieved by decompiling or otherwise extracting the key from the HUDweb plugin, which is publicly available.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain the hard-coded private key.
- Once they have the key, they can use it to compromise communication channels secured with the compromised certificate.

**Additional Notes:**
- A partial fix was released on May 5, 2016, but it still used hard-coded cryptographic material.
- A complete fix was released on December 20, 2016 with HUDweb 1.4.4.
- The vulnerability is specific to the HUDweb plugin of Fonality software.
