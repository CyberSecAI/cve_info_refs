{
  "CVE-2016-2069": {
    "Description": "Race condition in arch/x86/mm/tlb.c in the Linux kernel .4.1 allowed local users to gain privileges by triggering access to a paging structure by a different CPU.",
    "Root cause": "The Linux kernel had a race condition in the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) flush logic when invalidating a paging structure not currently in use. Another CPU could race to use that paging structure which could be vulnerable if writeable and reused.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Improper synchronization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users could potentially gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash/information leak) if a writable virtual->physical translation is reused for something critical.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "crafted application/code"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user with the ability to execute code."
  }
