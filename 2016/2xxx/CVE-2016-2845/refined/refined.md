    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to bypass CSP restrictions and obtain sensitive information.",

     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious website that exploits the CSP vulnerability with a service worker.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is in the browser's implementation of CSP, specifically in how it handles URLs when a ServiceWorker is involved. The fix involves ensuring that CSP ignores the URL's path component in the case of a ServiceWorker fetch."
