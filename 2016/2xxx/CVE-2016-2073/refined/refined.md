Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `htmlParseNameComplex()` function within `libxml2`'s HTML parser. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read occurs when the function attempts to access memory using an offset calculated as `ctxt->input->cur - len`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability. When parsing specially crafted HTML documents, the `htmlParseNameComplex` function calculates an incorrect memory address, leading to a read operation outside the allocated buffer. This happens because the calculated offset `ctxt->input->cur - len` goes beyond the beginning of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service, where the application using `libxml2` crashes due to the out-of-bounds read.
- **Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources suggest that arbitrary code execution might be possible, although the primary effect is a crash and DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious XML/HTML documents:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted XML or HTML file. The attacker needs to provide a file with a specific structure that causes the faulty offset calculation within the `htmlParseNameComplex()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable system/application with a crafted malicious XML or HTML document.
- The system/application needs to be using the vulnerable `libxml2` library to parse the crafted input.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `HTMLparser.c` line 2517: `return(xmlDictLookup(ctxt->dict, ctxt->input->cur - len, len));`
- The vulnerability can be triggered by specific malformed HTML input, especially related to the doctype or entity processing.
- Various reports show crashes and errors triggered in different contexts using `xmllint` or other applications utilizing `libxml2` as a parsing library.
- The vulnerability can be triggered in different applications including `ssconvert`,  `xmllint` and other apps that use libxml2 for HTML parsing.
- The bug report on GNOME bugzilla ([Bug 749115](show_bug.cgi?id=749115)) was marked as a duplicate of [Bug 758605](show_bug.cgi?id=758605), which is associated with CVE-2016-1839. This suggests a related root cause with slightly different attack triggers, although they were determined to be separate vulnerabilities.

The provided information gives a good understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, attack vectors, and attacker capabilities.
