- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FTP service on Huawei SmartAX MT882 ADSL modem crashes when a long directory name is created using the MKD command followed by another command that works with files or directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the FTP service due to a lack of proper input validation or handling of long directory names.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the FTP service and suspending operation of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted FTP commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the FTP service (port 21) and have valid login credentials (default username 'admin' and password 'tomenague').
