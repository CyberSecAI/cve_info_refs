  "CVE-2016-2828": {
    "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox before 47.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via WebGL content that triggers texture access after destruction of the texture's recycle pool.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of texture resources in WebGL, specifically when texture access occurs after the texture's recycle pool has been destroyed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by exploiting this use-after-free vulnerability. This could lead to system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Crafted WebGL Content"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious website that contains specific WebGL content to trigger the vulnerability. No user authentication or specific privileges are required to launch an attack.",
    "notes": "This is a moderate severity issue. SUSE rates this as a 6.8 on the CVSS v2 scale with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P and as a 8.8 on the CVSS v3 scale with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"
