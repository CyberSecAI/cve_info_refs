Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108
                 CVE-2016-2109 CVE-2016-2176

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer
toolkit.

CVE-2016-2105

    Guido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function
    EVP_EncodeUpdate(), used for Base64 encoding, if an attacker can
    supply a large amount of data. This could lead to a heap corruption.

CVE-2016-2106

    Guido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function
    EVP_EncryptUpdate() if an attacker can supply a large amount of data.
    This could lead to a heap corruption.

CVE-2016-2107

    Juraj Somorovsky discovered a padding oracle in the AES CBC cipher
    implementation based on the AES-NI instruction set. This could allow
    an attacker to decrypt TLS traffic encrypted with one of the cipher
    suites based on AES CBC.

CVE-2016-2108

    David Benjamin from Google discovered that two separate bugs in the
    ASN.1 encoder, related to handling of negative zero integer values
    and large universal tags, could lead to an out-of-bounds write.

CVE-2016-2109

    Brian Carpenter discovered that when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO
    using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio(), a short invalid encoding can
    casuse allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming
    excessive resources or exhausting memory.

CVE-2016-2176

    Guido Vranken discovered that ASN.1 Strings that are over 1024 bytes
    can cause an overread in applications using the X509_NAME_oneline()
    function on EBCDIC systems. This could result in arbitrary stack data
    being returned in the buffer.

Additional information about these issues can be found in the OpenSSL
security advisory at <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt>

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2h-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0996)

## Topic

An update for openssl is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* Two integer overflow flaws, leading to buffer overflows, were found in the way the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() and EVP\_EncryptUpdate() functions of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when the connection used the AES CBC cipher suite and the server supported AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a padding oracle. (CVE-2016-2107)
* Several flaws were found in the way BIO\_\*printf functions were implemented in OpenSSL. Applications which passed large amounts of untrusted data through these functions could crash or potentially execute code with the permissions of the user running such an application. (CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-2842)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data. (CVE-2016-2109)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108, CVE-2016-2842, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2107, and CVE-2016-0799. Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Böck, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108; Guido Vranken as the original reporter of CVE-2016-2842, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, and CVE-2016-0799; and Juraj Somorovsky as the original reporter of CVE-2016-2107.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security patch levels of 2017-11-05 or later address all issues associated with
the 2017-11-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels. To learn how
to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](//support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

**2. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**3. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**4. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](//developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**5. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and the
Android Security Bulletins?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in the Android Security Bulletins
are required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities, such as those documented in this
bulletin, are not required for declaring a security patch level.

#### Description

The ASN.1 implementation in OpenSSL before 1.0.1o and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer underflow and memory corruption) via an ANY field in crafted serialized data, aka the "negative zero" issue.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Note that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800).  Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below).  Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if they've not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been deployed.  Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers.  OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN:  SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time.  Builds that are not configured with "enable-ssl2" will not support SSLv2.  Even if "enable-ssl2" is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23_method() will need to explicitly call either of:     SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);    or    SSL_clear_options(ssl, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);  as appropriate.  Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available.  In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL.  Builds that are not configured with "enable-weak-ssl-ciphers" will not provide any "EXPORT" or "LOW" strength ciphers.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on December 29th 2015 by Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel. The fix was developed by Viktor Dukhovni and Matt Caswell of OpenSSL.   SUSE Note: this also affects openssl 0.9.7 and 0.9.8. ``` [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=968046#c28)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-03-01 15:00:29 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (968046) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/363587> 13.2 / openssl ``` [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=968046#c29)  Cristian Rodríguez   2016-03-01 16:23:35 UTC  ``` openssl is built without sslv2 support since april 11, 2014..any product released after that date needs no patch. ``` [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=968046#c30)  Vítězslav Čížek   2016-03-01 16:45:17 UTC  ``` All affected openssl packages are now submitted.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

# CVE-2016-0702

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-0701.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-0703.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-0702 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0702)

#### Description

The MOD\_EXP\_CTIME\_COPY\_FROM\_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn\_exp.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not properly consider cache-bank access times during modular exponentiation, which makes it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a "CacheBleed" attack.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 310 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [July 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2282980.1).

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use  [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html) .

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible** . Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2017 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2261562.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2261562.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 32 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 28 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 276 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2136219.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2136219.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 13 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
2. Applies to installation process on client deployment of Java.
3. Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1 security update on RHEL 7

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1648)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1 for
RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
(mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
Native library.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0,
and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1
Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
available shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/>

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1. The JBoss server
process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP

requests to initialize the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts,
which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations
to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could
possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script
to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
(CVE-2016-5387)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of
input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application
using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts
of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an
application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2106)

* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http

server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service
messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting
CVE-2016-5387; the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2105 and
CVE-2016-2106; and Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110.
Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-2105 and CVE-2016-2106.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server
installation (including all applications and configuration files).

Note: Do not install Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2 on a host which has Red Hat
JBoss Web Server 1 installed.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes
described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library
must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.1 Release Notes for a list of non security related fixes..

FreeBSD-SA-16:17.openssl Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities
Category: contrib
Module: openssl
Announced: 2016-05-04
Credits: OpenSSL Project
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2016-05-03 18:54:20 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE)
2016-05-04 15:25:47 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p2)
2016-05-04 15:26:23 UTC (releng/10.2, 10.2-RELEASE-p16)
2016-05-04 15:27:09 UTC (releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p33)
2016-05-04 06:53:02 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-STABLE)
2016-05-04 15:27:09 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p41)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2109,
CVE-2016-2176
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
The padding check in AES-NI CBC MAC was rewritten to be in constant time
by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against
either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was
enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes. [CVE-2016-2107]
An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for
Base64 encoding of binary data. [CVE-2016-2105]
An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function, however it is
believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem.
[CVE-2016-2106]
When ASN.1 data is read from a BIO using functions such as d2i\_CMS\_bio()
a short invalid encoding can casuse allocation of large amounts of memory
potentially consuming excessive resources or exhausting memory.
[CVE-2016-2109]
ASN1 Strings that are over 1024 bytes can cause an overread in applications
using the X509\_NAME\_oneline() function on EBCDIC systems. [CVE-2016-2176]
FreeBSD does not run on any EBCDIC systems and therefore is not affected.
III. Impact
A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic
when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support
AES-NI. [CVE-2016-2107]
If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a
length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. [CVE-2016-2105]
Any application parsing untrusted data through d2i BIO functions are vulnerable
to memory exhaustion attack. [CVE-2016-2109] TLS applications are not affected.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 10.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:17/openssl-10.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:17/openssl-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:17/openssl-9.patc
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:17/openssl-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/9/ r299053
releng/9.3/ r299068

# [R7] LCE 4.8.1 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

The Log Correlation Engine (LCE) is potentially impacted by several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (20160503), libpcre / PCRE, Libxml2, Handlebars, libcurl, and jQuery that were recently disclosed and fixed. Note that due to the time involved in doing a full analysis of each issue, Tenable has opted to upgrade the included versions of each library as a precaution, and to save time. These vulnerabilities **may** impact LCE and include:

* OpenSSL ASN.1 Encoder Negative Zero Value Handling Remote Memory Corruption
* OpenSSL crypto/evp/encode.c EVP\_EncodeUpdate() Function Heap Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL AES-NI CBC MAC Check Padding Oracle MitM Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL crypto/evp/evp\_enc.c EVP\_EncryptUpdate() Function Heap Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL crypto/x509/x509\_obj.c X509\_NAME\_oneline() Function ASN1 Strings Handling Out-of-bounds Read Memory Disclosure
* OpenSSL crypto/asn1/a\_d2i\_fp.c ASN.1 BIO Length Field Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) pcre\_compile.c (\*ACCEPT) Verb Handling Buffer Overflow
* Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) pcretest.c pchars() Function Out-of-bounds Read Weakness
* Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) pcre\_compile.c compile\_branch() Function Invalid Pattern Fragment Handling Stack Corruption
* Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) pcretest.c Out-of-bounds Read Weakness
* Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) pcre\_compile.c pcre\_compile2() Function Duplicate Named Group Nested Back Reference Handling Heap Buffer Overflow
* Libxml2 parser.c xmlParseElementDecl() / xmlParseConditionalSections() Functions Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* Libxml2 Multiple Functionality Format Strings
* Libxml2 HTMLparser.c htmlParseNameComplex() Function HTML File Encoding Detection Failure
* Libxml2 parser.c xmlStringLenDecodeEntities() Function Unspecified XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Issue
* Libxml2 xmlregexp.c xmlFAParseCharRange() Function Heap Buffer Overflow
* Libxml2 parser.c xmlParseStartTag2() Function Heap Use-after-free
* Libxml2 parser.c xmlParseNCNameComplex() Function Heap Use-after-free
* Libxml2 xmlstring.c xmlStrncatNew() Function Heap Buffer Overflow
* Libxml2 HTMLparser.c htmlParseSystemLiteral() / htmlParsePubidLiteral() Functions Heap Buffer Overflow
* Libxml2 xmlsave.c xmlBufAttrSerializeTxtContent() Function Recover Mode XML Content Handling Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* Libxml2 parser.c Multiple Function Recursive xmlStringDecodeEntities() Call Handling Stack Overflow DoS
* Libxml2 uri.c xmlParse3986Port() Function Port Argument Handling Integer Overflow Unspecified Issue
* Libxml2 HTMLparser.c htmlParseName() / htmlParseNameComplex() Functions Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* Libxml2 parser.c xmlParserEntityCheck() Function Recovery Mode XML Content Parsing Recursion DoS
* Libxml2 parser.c xmlParseEndTag2() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* Libxml2 parserInternals.c xmlNextChar() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* Handlebars lib/handlebars/utils.js Template Unquoted Attributes Improper Escaping XSS Weakness
* cURL / libcurl lib/multi.c close\_all\_connections() Function Easy Handle Handling Use-after-free Issue
* cURL / libcurl lib/vtls/vtls.c TLS Session Resumption Client Certificate Validation Bypass
* cURL / libcurl lib/vtls/vtls.c Curl\_ssl\_config\_matches() Function TLS Connection Reuse Cross-realm Information Disclosure
* jQuery Core ajax/script.js Third-party Text Handling XSS

Tenable's Log Correlation Engine (LCE) was found to be impacted by an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad and discovered internally. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

[R5 Update] LCE was also found to be vulnerable to a second authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found internally by Rich Walchuck and was inadvertently left out of the advisory at publication. This is designated as LCE-4806 for tracking purposes.

# USN-2959-1: OpenSSL vulnerabilities

3 May 2016

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala, Hanno Böck, and David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL

incorrectly handled memory when decoding ASN.1 structures. A remote

attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2108](/security/CVE-2016-2108))

Juraj Somorovsky discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed padding when

the connection uses the AES CBC cipher and the server supports AES-NI. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle

attack and decrypt traffic. ([CVE-2016-2107](/security/CVE-2016-2107))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of

input data to the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use

this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2105](/security/CVE-2016-2105))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of

input data to the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use

this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2106](/security/CVE-2016-2106))

Brian Carpenter discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when

ASN.1 data is read from a BIO. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-2109](/security/CVE-2016-2109))

As a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to

reject DH key sizes below 1024 bits, preventing a possible downgrade

attack.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provides fixes for certain Oracle products for the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) Intel processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the [Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1) MOS note (Doc ID 2347948.1).

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 238 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [January 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2338411.1)

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2018 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 18 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [3rd May 2016]
========================================
Memory corruption in the ASN.1 encoder (CVE-2016-2108)
======================================================
Severity: High
This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug
causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released
as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact
of the bug was not known at the time.
In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero
represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow
with an out-of-bounds write in i2c\_ASN1\_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does
not normally create "negative zeroes" when parsing ASN.1 input, and
therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug.
However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser
(specifically, d2i\_ASN1\_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag
as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any
common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY
structures.
Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures
containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may
be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to
cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some
malloc implementations.
Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to
be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509
certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with
valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the
bug. Specifically, since OpenSSL's default TLS X509 chain verification
code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes
could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted
Certification Authorities.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2c
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1o
This vulnerability is a combination of two bugs, neither of which
individually has security impact. The first bug (mishandling of
negative zero integers) was reported to OpenSSL by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala
(Red Hat) and independently by Hanno BÃ¶ck in April 2015. The second
issue (mishandling of large universal tags) was found using libFuzzer,
and reported on the public issue tracker on March 1st 2016. The fact
that these two issues combined present a security vulnerability was
reported by David Benjamin (Google) on March 31st 2016. The fixes were
developed by Steve Henson of the OpenSSL development team, and David
Benjamin. The OpenSSL team would also like to thank Mark Brand and
Ian Beer from the Google Project Zero team for their careful analysis
of the impact.
The fix for the "negative zero" memory corruption bug can be
identified by commits
3661bb4e7934668bd99ca777ea8b30eedfafa871 (1.0.2)
and
32d3b0f52f77ce86d53f38685336668d47c5bdfe (1.0.1)
Padding oracle in AES-NI CBC MAC check (CVE-2016-2107)
======================================================
Severity: High
A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic
when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support
AES-NI.
This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding
attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in
constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and
compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer
checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding
bytes.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 13th of April 2016 by Juraj
Somorovsky using TLS-Attacker. The fix was developed by Kurt Roeckx
of the OpenSSL development team.
EVP\_EncodeUpdate overflow (CVE-2016-2105)
=========================================
Severity: Low
An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for
Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large
amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap
corruption.
Internally to OpenSSL the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the
PEM\_write\_bio\* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL
command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable
because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible.
User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted
data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the
PEM\_write\_bio\* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit
message. This is no longer believed to be the case).
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 3rd March 2016 by Guido Vranken. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
EVP\_EncryptUpdate overflow (CVE-2016-2106)
==========================================
Severity: Low
An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is
able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to
EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow
resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal
usage of the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms.
The first form is where the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first
called function after an EVP\_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call
must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP\_EncryptUpdate()
can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no
possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it
is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem.
It should be noted that EVP\_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() in
certain code paths. Also EVP\_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for
EVP\_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too
and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow
could occur.
This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this
function directly.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 3rd March 2016 by Guido Vranken. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
ASN.1 BIO excessive memory allocation (CVE-2016-2109)
=====================================================
Severity: Low
When ASN.1 data is read from a BIO using functions such as d2i\_CMS\_bio()
a short invalid encoding can casuse allocation of large amounts of memory
potentially consuming excessive resources or exhausting memory.
Any application parsing untrusted data through d2i BIO functions is affected.
The memory based functions such as d2i\_X509() are \*not\* affected. Since the
memory based functions are used by the TLS library, TLS applications are not
affected.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 4th April 2016 by Brian Carpenter.
The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL development team.
EBCDIC overread (CVE-2016-2176)
===============================
Severity: Low
ASN1 Strings that are over 1024 bytes can cause an overread in applications
using the X509\_NAME\_oneline() function on EBCDIC systems. This could result in
arbitrary stack data being returned in the buffer.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 5th March 2016 by Guido Vranken. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Note
====
As per our previous announcements and our Release Strategy
(https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html), support for OpenSSL

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the worst of
which allows attackers to conduct a time based side-channel attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.2j** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.2j** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. Please review
the CVE identifiers and the International Association for Cryptologic
Research’s (IACR) paper, “Make Sure DSA Signing Exponentiations
Really are Constant-Time” for further details.

### Impact

Remote attackers could cause a Denial of Service condition or have other
unspecified impacts. Additionally, a time based side-channel attack may
allow a local attacker to recover a private DSA key.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.2j"

```

# Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle VM Server for x86 Security Advisories (OVMSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6109

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display,
a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate
the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional ﬁles being transferred. This
affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6110

In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-0799 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0799)

#### Description

The fmtstr function in crypto/bio/b\_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g improperly calculates string lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (overflow and out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-2842.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 14:04:59 UTC  ``` Quoting form the draft of OpenSSL upstream advisory:  EVP_EncodeUpdate overflow ([CVE-2016-2105](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2105)) =========================================  Severity: Low  An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.  Internally to OpenSSL the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM_write_bio* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM_write_bio* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 3rd March 2016 by Guido Vranken. The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 14:05:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the OpenSSL project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 14:06:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1151923](attachment.cgi?id=1151923&action=diff "OpenSSL upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1151923&action=edit "OpenSSL upstream fix") OpenSSL upstream fix   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c5)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:19:29 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c6)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:28:36 UTC  ```  Created openssl101e tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1332590](show_bug.cgi?id=1332590 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 openssl101e: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c7)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:28:42 UTC  ```  Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332588](show_bug.cgi?id=1332588 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c8)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:28:48 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332589](show_bug.cgi?id=1332589 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 mingw-openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1332591](show_bug.cgi?id=1332591 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 mingw-openssl: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-04 13:28:25 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5b814481f3573fa9677f3a31ee51322e2a22ee6a>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1331441#c11)  Fedora Update System    2016-05-04 18:51:30 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.2h-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

+ 18 October 2016
+ 17 January 2017
+ 18 April 2017
+ 18 July 2017

# Welcome to Red Hat Bugzilla

Thank you for visiting Red Hat Bugzilla. Red Hat Bugzilla is the Red Hat bug-tracking
system and is used to submit and review defects that have been found in Red
Hat distributions. Red Hat Bugzilla is not an avenue for
technical assistance or support, but simply a bug tracking system. If you submit a
defect, please provide detailed information in your submission after you
have queried Red Hat Bugzilla to ensure the defect has not been reported yet.
Defects will go directly to the engineer responsible for the component you
filed the defect against. Engineers have many responsibilities and will get to
your defect in due time.

If you are a Red Hat customer with an active subscription, please
visit the  [Red Hat Customer Portal](http://access.redhat.com)
for assistance with your issue.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2420273.1).

Many industry experts anticipate that exploits leveraging known flaws in modern processor designs will continue to be disclosed for the foreseeable future (i.e., “Spectre” variants). For information related to these issues, please refer to:

* the January 2018 Critical Patch Update (and later) Advisories,
* the "Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754)" ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)), and
* "Information about processor vulnerabilities CVE-2018-3640 ("Spectre v3a") and CVE-2018-3639 ("Spectre v4")" ([Doc ID 2399123.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2399123.1)).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 44 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  38 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2394520.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2394520.1).

The vulnerability is due to the way the affected software encodes certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted certificate to the targeted system. An exploit could cause the affected software to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a targeted user running an application that is using the OpenSSL library. If the user has elevated privileges, a successful exploit could result in a complete system compromise.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2108.      **OpenSSL AES CBC Cipher Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to decrypt and access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient padding checks by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a padding oracle attack if the attacker is in a man-in-the-middle position between a targeted system and a Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server supporting Advanced Encryption Standards New Instructions (AES-NI) and the connection uses an AES Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) cipher. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive information in encrypted packets, which could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2107.      **OpenSSL EVP\_EncryptUpdate Function Overflow Heap Corruption Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.      The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting large amounts of specially crafted data to the *EVP\_EncryptUpdate()* function of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or cause a DoS condition on a targeted system.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2106.      **OpenSSL EVP\_EncodeUpdate Function Overflow Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the *EVP\_EncodeUpdate()* function in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checks by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting large amounts of data to an application that uses the OpenSSL library on a targeted system. A successful exploit could trigger an overflow condition that results in heap corruption. The attacker could use the heap corruption to cause the application to crash or to execute arbitrary code in the security context of the user who is running the application. If the user is running the application with elevated privileges, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with those privileges and compromise the system completely.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2105.      **OpenSSL d2i\_CMS\_bio Function Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.      The vulnerability is due to memory exhaustion while processing certain data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ASN.1 data to a targeted system. An exploit could cause the consumption of excessive memory resources, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2109.      **OpenSSL ASN.1 Strings X509\_NAME\_oneline Function Overread Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.      The vulnerability is due to improper memory processes by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ASN.1 string greater than 1004 bytes to the *X509\_NAME\_oneline()* function of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause a memory overread condition and gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2176.  Workarounds  * Any workarounds, when available, will be documented in the Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>      Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 18:02:27 UTC  ``` Quoting form the draft of OpenSSL upstream advisory:  EVP_EncryptUpdate overflow ([CVE-2016-2106](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2106)) ==========================================  Severity: Low  An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur.  This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1t  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 3rd March 2016 by Guido Vranken. The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 18:02:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the OpenSSL project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2016-04-28 18:04:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1152021](attachment.cgi?id=1152021&action=diff "OpenSSL upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1152021&action=edit "OpenSSL upstream fix") OpenSSL upstream fix   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c5)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:19:34 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c6)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:28:54 UTC  ```  Created openssl101e tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1332590](show_bug.cgi?id=1332590 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 openssl101e: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c7)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:29:01 UTC  ```  Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332588](show_bug.cgi?id=1332588 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c8)  Martin Prpič    2016-05-03 14:29:07 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332589](show_bug.cgi?id=1332589 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 mingw-openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1332591](show_bug.cgi?id=1332591 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 mingw-openssl: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2016-05-04 12:55:22 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=3f3582139fbb259a1c3cbb0a25236500a409bf26>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1331536#c11)  Fedora Update System    2016-05-04 18:51:23 UTC  ``` openssl-1.0.2h-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* Two integer overflow flaws, leading to buffer overflows, were found in the way the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() and EVP\_EncryptUpdate() functions of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when the connection used the AES CBC cipher suite and the server supported AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a padding oracle. (CVE-2016-2107)
* Several flaws were found in the way BIO\_\*printf functions were implemented in OpenSSL. Applications which passed large amounts of untrusted data through these functions could crash or potentially execute code with the permissions of the user running such an application. (CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-2842)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data. (CVE-2016-2109)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108, CVE-2016-2842, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2107, and CVE-2016-0799.

# CVE-2016-2107

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-2106.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-2108.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-2107 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107)

#### Description

The AES-NI implementation in OpenSSL before 1.0.1t and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2h does not consider memory allocation during a certain padding check, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information via a padding-oracle attack against an AES CBC session. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-0169.

Important: Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1 security update on RHEL 6

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1649)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1 for
RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
(mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
Native library.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0,
and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1
Release Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the
most significant of these changes.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1. The JBoss server
process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP

requests to initialize the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts,
which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations
to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could
possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script
to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
(CVE-2016-5387)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of
input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application
using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105)

* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the

way the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts
of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an
application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2106)

* It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http

server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod\_cluster via service
messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting
CVE-2016-5387; the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2105 and
CVE-2016-2106; and Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110.
Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-2105 and CVE-2016-2106.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server
installation (including all applications and configuration files).

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes
described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library
must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.1 Release Notes for a
list of non security related fixes.

The AES-NI implementation in OpenSSL before 1.0.1t and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2h does not consider memory allocation during a certain padding check, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information via a padding-oracle attack against an AES CBC session. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-0169.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2073)

## Topic

An update for openssl is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* Two integer overflow flaws, leading to buffer overflows, were found in the way the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() and EVP\_EncryptUpdate() functions of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when the connection used the AES CBC cipher suite and the server supported AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a padding oracle. (CVE-2016-2107)
* Several flaws were found in the way BIO\_\*printf functions were implemented in OpenSSL. Applications which passed large amounts of untrusted data through these functions could crash or potentially execute code with the permissions of the user running such an application. (CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-2842)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data. (CVE-2016-2109)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108, CVE-2016-2842, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2107, and CVE-2016-0799. Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Böck, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108; Guido Vranken as the original reporter of CVE-2016-2842, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, and CVE-2016-0799; and Juraj Somorovsky as the original reporter of CVE-2016-2107.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

# CVE-2016-0800

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-0799.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-0821.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-0800 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0800)

#### Description

The SSLv2 protocol, as used in OpenSSL before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g and other products, requires a server to send a ServerVerify message before establishing that a client possesses certain plaintext RSA data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, aka a "DROWN" attack.
