Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2837:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow in the ClearKey Content Decryption Module (CDM). The vulnerability exists due to incorrect bounds checking within the ClearKeyDecryptor::Decrypt function in the gmp-clearkey plugin when copying data into a buffer. Specifically, the size of the copy operation is not validated against the destination buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability allows writing past the end of an allocated buffer on the heap.
*   **Incorrect bounds checking:** The code fails to properly validate the size of data being copied, allowing a crafted input to overflow the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The most direct impact is a crash in the plugin process, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** If combined with a separate vulnerability that enables escaping the Gecko Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox, this buffer overflow could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the process. However, this is not a certainty as the overflow occurs in a sandboxed process, which can hinder further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious video content:** A malformed video file can trigger the overflow by controlling the size parameters of the data being copied. The user must open or access the malicious video content, usually through a website.
*   **Web content:** Malicious web pages can exploit this flaw through the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker needs to deliver the crafted video content to a user to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User interaction:** The victim must interact with a malicious website or video file.
*   **Control over data sizes:** The attacker needs control over the size parameters of the encrypted data being processed by the ClearKey CDM.
*   **Potential sandbox bypass:** To achieve arbitrary code execution, the attacker also needs a separate vulnerability to escape the GMP sandbox.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by an anonymous security researcher working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   The vulnerability affects the clearkey plugin.
*   The issue was fixed in Firefox 48 and Firefox ESR 45.3.
*   The vulnerability is present in GMP (Gecko Media Plugin) component.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to accommodate the copied data, preventing the overflow.

**Summary**

CVE-2016-2837 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the ClearKey CDM of Mozilla Firefox and Firefox ESR. It can be triggered by a malformed video, leading to DoS or possibly code execution, if combined with a sandbox escape. The attacker needs user interaction to trigger the vulnerability via malicious web content or video.
