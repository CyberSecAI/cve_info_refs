- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WHIP protocol parser in the Huawei SmartAX MT882 ADSL Modem improperly calculates the size of the second packet based on the first byte of the first packet, leading to an out-of-bounds write on the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow (potential, not fully probed).
    - Incorrect size calculation of the second packet received, leading to writing past the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) by sending specially crafted packets to port 8701, causing the device to become inoperable.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based.
    - Exploitation involves sending two packets to the device's TCP port 8701. The first packet (4 bytes) determines the length of the second packet, leading to the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Remote attacker capable of sending network packets to the device.
    - No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
