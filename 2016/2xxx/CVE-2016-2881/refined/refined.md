- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Reliance on modifiable input for security protection. This input is trusted, which an untrusted actor can manipulate.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Bypassing the intended protection mechanism. The specific impact is not detailed.
- **Attack vectors**:  Modification of a specific input by an untrusted actor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to modify the input used by the protection mechanism, i.e., the attacker must have access to modify this specific input.
