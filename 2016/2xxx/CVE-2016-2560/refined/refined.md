  "cveId": "CVE-2016-2560",
  "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.15, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.5, and 4.5.x before 4.5.5.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) a crafted Host HTTP header, related to libraries/Config.class.php; (2) crafted JSON data, related to file_echo.php; (3) a crafted SQL query, related to js/functions.js; (4) the initial parameter to libraries/server_privileges.lib.php in the user accounts page; or (5) the it parameter to libraries/controllers/TableSearchController.class.php in the zoom search page.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "source": "github.com_d5887cd4_20250125_183451.html",
      "rootCause": "The code for inline editing of SQL queries in js/functions.js does not properly escape user input before injecting it into the HTML document. Specifically, it uses `$inner_sql.html()` which is vulnerable to XSS.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, leading to potential execution of arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser.",
      "attackVectors": [
         "By crafting a malicious SQL query that contains JavaScript code, an attacker can inject this into a page, specifically when the code is displayed as part of inline editing.",
         "An attacker can modify a SQL query such that the resulting HTML output contains malicious Javascript code."

      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to modify or submit a SQL query that is then rendered on the page."
    },
    {
      "source": "github.com_74500166_20250125_183453.html",
      "rootCause": "The `PMA_getUsersOverview` function in `libraries/server_privileges.lib.php` doesn't escape the `initial` parameter from the GET request before using it in HTML output.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the user accounts page through the `initial` parameter, potentially hijacking user sessions or performing other malicious actions.",
       "attackVectors": [
         "By crafting a URL with a malicious value for the `initial` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user accounts page when a user accesses the modified link."

      {
      "source": "github.com_6bd5bf46_20250125_183454.html",
      "rootCause": "The `file_echo.php` file was not setting the correct Content-Type header for JSON data. This could lead to browsers attempting to auto-detect the content type, which might introduce unexpected behavior or security issues.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Content-Type Header"

       "impact": "While not directly exploitable as XSS itself, this improper header could lead to browsers misinterpreting the content and potentially introducing security vulnerabilities, if combined with other issues.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "An attacker could potentially exploit this issue by sending a request to `file_echo.php` with a crafted `monitorconfig` or `import` parameter, which then leads to the browser misinterpreting the JSON content."
