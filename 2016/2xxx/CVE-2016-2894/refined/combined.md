# IT13686: ACL LOST AFTER RETRIEVE OF A SYMBOLIC LINK IF LINK CROSSES FILESYSTEM BOUNDARY CAN RESULT IN AN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

## A fix is available

[IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client 6.3.2.x interim fix downloads - EOL](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/580843)

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

##

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  The ACL associated with a file or directory object may be lost
  after an archive/retrieve if all the following conditions are
  true:

  . The archive is performed from a source filesystem, and in this
     filesystem tree there is a symbolic link pointing to another
     filesystem
  . The source and target filesystems are of different types
     (example  GPFS and EXT3  )
  . The archive is performed with default client option
     "archsymlinkasfile yes"
  . At least one object at the target of the link has some special
     ACL set.

  During retrieve, the target of the link is retrieved in the
  source filesystem as directory and files because of the
  "archsymlinkasfile yes" option, but the ACLs are lost.
  This does not affect filesystems types which use same system
  call to access ACL.  For example JFS and JFS2.

  As a result of this issue, when performing an archive and
  retrieve operation using a symbolic link, the IBM Tivoli Storage
  Manager client could allow a local user to access files they are
  otherwise not allowed to access.

  Tivoli Storage Manager Client Versions Affected: 6.3  , 6.4 ,
  7.1 on All Unix platforms,

  Initial Impact: Medium

  Additional Keywords:  TSM archsymlinkasfile ANS2042W

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  - Archive the source filesystem using archsymlinkasfile=no  and
    also archive the target of the link in the same or another
    archive operation.
  - During retrieve the two filesystems  will need to be
    retrieved.

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  ****************************************************************
  * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *

  * running on Linux, AIX, HPUX and Solaris                      *
  ****************************************************************

  ****************************************************************
  * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
  * Apply fixing level when available. This problem is currently *
  * projected to be fixed in level 7.1.6.                        *
  * Note that this information is subject to change at the       *
  * discretion of IBM.                                           *
  ****************************************************************
  *

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  The archive operation will save ACL in case the file system
  border is crossed and the option archsymlinkasfile is set.

  ```

## Temporary fix

* ```
  A fix for this problem is currently targeted for interim fix
  packages 6.4.3.3 and 6.3.2.6. Note that until these interim
  fixes are actually available, this information is subject to
  change at the discretion of IBM.
