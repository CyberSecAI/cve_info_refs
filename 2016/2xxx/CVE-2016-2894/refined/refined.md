Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from how the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (IBM Spectrum Protect) client handles symbolic links during archive and retrieve operations when the symbolic link crosses file system boundaries, and the `archsymlinkasfile` client option is set to `yes`. When a symbolic link points to a different file system, the ACLs (Access Control Lists) of the target files/directories are not correctly preserved during a retrieve operation if the source and target filesystems are of different types (e.g. GPFS and EXT3). This occurs when the symbolic link is treated as if it were a file and its contents are archived.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect ACL handling:** The client fails to properly restore ACLs for files and directories pointed to by symbolic links that cross file system boundaries when using the 'archsymlinkasfile=yes' option.
*   **Loss of Access Control:** The ACLs associated with files are lost after a retrieve operation, potentially granting unauthorized access to other local users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A local user could gain access to files and directories they would otherwise be restricted from accessing. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** A local user with access to the machine running the vulnerable IBM Tivoli Storage Manager client can exploit this.
*   **Symbolic link manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specific symbolic link structure where the link crosses filesystems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local user privileges:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system where the vulnerable client is installed.
*   **Knowledge of file system structure:** The attacker would need to understand the file system structure and be able to create symbolic links that point to files in different file systems where they want to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Archive and Retrieve operations:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate archive and retrieve operations using the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager client.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue occurs when the `archsymlinkasfile` client option is set to `yes` (default), which causes the client to treat symbolic links as regular files, and to archive the target of the link.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Client (IBM Spectrum Protect), including versions 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 7.1 on AIX, HP-UX, Linux and Solaris.
*   A fix for this issue involves ensuring that ACLs are preserved during archive operations when the file system border is crossed and the `archsymlinkasfile` option is set.
*   A temporary workaround involves archiving the symbolic link with `archsymlinkasfile=no` and also archiving the target of the link in the same or another operation. During restore, the two filesystems will need to be retrieved.
