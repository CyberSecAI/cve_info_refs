{
  "CVE-2016-2047": {
    "Description": "The ssl_verify_server_cert function in sql-common/client.c in MariaDB before 5.5.47, 10.0.x before 10.0.23, and 10.1.x before 10.1.10; Oracle MySQL 5.5.48 and earlier, 5.6.29 and earlier, and 5.7.11 and earlier; and Percona Server do not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a \"/CN=\" string in a field in a certificate, as demonstrated by \"/OU=/CN=bar.com/CN=foo.com.\"",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect parsing of server certificate data due to improper use of X509_NAME_oneline(), which does not sanitize or limit what is considered part of the CN. Specifically the client-side hostname verification using the `/CN=` string.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper certificate validation",
      "Use of insecure string parsing function"
    ],
    "Impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can spoof SSL servers by providing a certificate with a crafted `/CN=` string and trick the client into accepting it, thus bypassing hostname verification.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based man-in-the-middle attack. Attacker intercepts the connection between a MariaDB client and server and replaces the server certificate.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between a client and server to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. Ability to generate a malicious certificate with a carefully constructed /CN= string."
