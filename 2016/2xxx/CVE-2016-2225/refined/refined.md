{
  "CVE-2016-2225": {
    "Description": "The __read_etc_hosts_r function in libc/inet/resolv.c in uClibc-ng before 1.0.12 allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted packet.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A crafted DNS packet can cause the parser to terminate early, leading to an uninitialized buffer being passed to strdup().",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper handling of crafted DNS packets",
      "Uninitialized buffer usage",
      "Early termination of parsing"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to an infinite loop when parsing compressed DNS items or premature termination of the parser.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote DNS servers sending crafted packets"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to send crafted DNS packets to a vulnerable system"
  }
