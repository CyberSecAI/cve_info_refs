Vendor description:
-------------------
"Securely connecting your small business to the outside world is as important
as connecting your internal network devices to one another. Cisco Small
Business RV Series Routers offer virtual private networking (VPN) technology
so your remote workers can connect to your network through a secure Internet
pathway."

Source: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/index.html>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
We want to thank Cisco for the very quick and professional response and great
coordination. Customers are urged to update the firmware of their devices.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH on an emulated device at least.

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.19 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7547, "getaddrinfo() buffer overflow")
was verified by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.23.2 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Vulnerabilities - IoT Inspector Report
Further information can be found in IoT Inspector report:
<https://r.sec-consult.com/ciscoiot>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The following hardcoded hashes were found in the 'shadow' file of the firmware:
root:$1$hPNSjUZA$7eKqEpqVYltt9xJ6f0OGf0:15533:0:99999:7:::
debug-admin:$1$.AAm0iJ4$na9wZwly9pSrdS8MhcGKw/:15541:0:99999:7:::
[...]

The undocumented user 'debug-admin' is also contained in this file.

Starting the dropbear daemon as background process on emulated firmware:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# dropbear -E
# [1109] <timestamp> Running in background
#
# [1112] <timestamp> Child connection from <IP>:52718
[1112] <timestamp> /var must be owned by user or root, and not writable by others
[1112] <timestamp> Password auth succeeded for 'debug-admin' from <IP>:52718
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log on via another host connected to the same network. For this PoC the
password of the debug-admin was changed in the 'shadow' file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost medusa]# ssh debug-admin@<IP> /bin/ash -i
debug-admin@<IP>'s password:
/bin/ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

/tmp $
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'debug-admin' user has the same privileges like 'root'. This can be
determined from the corresponding sudoers file in the firmware:
[...]
## User privilege specification
##
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
debug-admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
[...]

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.19 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402, CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472,
CVE-2015-5277, CVE-2015-8778, CVE-2015-8779, CVE-2017-1000366 and more.

The getaddrinfo() buffer overflow vulnerability was checked with the help of
the exploit code from <https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

# python cve-2015-7547-poc.py &
[1] 961
# chroot /medusa_rootfs/ bin/ash

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.23.2 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147, CVE-2018-20679,
CVE-2017-16544 and CVE-2019-5747.
The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device:

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Details

Tyler Hicks discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled symlinks inside tar

archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted tar archive, a remote attacker could overwrite arbitrary

files outside of the current directory. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-5325](/security/CVE-2011-5325))

Mathias Krause discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled kernel module

loading restrictions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

bypass intended restrictions. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-9645](/security/CVE-2014-9645))

It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain ZIP archives. If

Subject: two udhcpc (busybox) issues

This is probably only relevant for the embedded space. Sharing two issues I
found in busybox' dhcp client implementation:

CVE-2016-2147 / OOB heap write due to integer underflow
<https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=d474ffc68290e0a83651c4432eeabfa62cd51e87>

CVE-2016-2148 / heap overflow in OPTION_6RD parsing
<https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=352f79acbd759c14399e39baef21fc4ffe180ac2>

Cheers,
Nico

You can work around it by reverting this   [patch](https://busybox.net/0001-mdev-create-devices-from-sys-dev.patch)   in 1.26.x BusyBox sources.

For example, there is no /bin directory (and therefore ubiquitous #!/bin/sh   scripts won't work). Instead, there is /system/bin.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S (SM-T700 model) and I made it compile Busybox as follows:   + "Rooted" the tablet (acquired root access). This step is device-specific.   + Installed the SuperSU application.   + Installed the [Termux](https://termux.com/) application -     it provides a small repository of essential tools: gcc-based toolchain,     git, ncurses, etc.   + Ran its terminal, installed packages I needed, pulled Busybox git tree.   + Created a /bin symlink to /system/bin, to make #!/bin/sh scripts work     (the build fails otherwise).   + Now the usual "make defconfig", "make menuconfig", "make" work.  Some parts won't compile (not all kernel headers are present, libc API   different or incomplete, etc). The maximal config which did compile   is now in the git tree, in configs/android\_502\_defconfig.   The toolchain provided by Termux is based on Android's Bionic libc   and Bionic has some design problems. An annoying one is that off\_t is   32-bit, struct\_stat::st\_size is not off\_t (this violates standard   expectations), therefore CONFIG\_LFS=y does not build, and CONFIG\_LFS=n   builds with warnings (printf'ing st->st\_size with wrong specifier). * **24 March 2016 -- BusyBox 1.24.2 (stable)** [BusyBox 1.24.2](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.24.2.tar.bz2).   ([git](https://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/?h=1_24_stable),   [patches](https://busybox.net/downloads/fixes-1.24.2/),   [how to add a patch](https://busybox.net/fix.html))  Bug fix release. 1.24.2 has fixes for   build system (static build with glibc fixed),   truncate, gunzip and unzip. * **24 October 2015 -- BusyBox 1.24.1 (stable)** [BusyBox 1.24.1](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.24.1.tar.bz2).   ([git](https://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/?h=1_24_stable),   [patches](https://busybox.net/downloads/fixes-1.24.1/),   [how to add a patch](https://busybox.net/fix.html))  Bug fix release. 1.24.1 has fixes for   ftpd (DIR parameter works for non-root too),   httpd (heap overflow fix),   sort (fix for a a problem affecting glibc build).   Build system has a fix for the lost link-time optimizations. In 1.24.0 announcement,   you might have noticed that sizes unexpectedly grew relative to 1.23.2. Now it is fixed:   ```         text    data     bss     dec     hex filename    860126     486    7272  867884   d3e2c busybox-1.23.2    869074     516    7364  876954   d619a busybox-1.24.0 (buggy link script)    858906     486    7180  866572   d390c busybox-1.24.0 (fixed link script)    858941     486    7180  866607   d392f busybox-1.24.1   ```  Check out a new applet, "uevent". It is a netlink listener. It provides   alternative to having mdev as kernel hotplug helper. Instead of setting up   the former via "echo /sbin/mdev >/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug", start "uevent mdev"   early during boot. "uevent" will run "mdev" for each hotplug event, waiting   for each child to terminate before starting a next one.  The former method does not require a long-lived listener process,   but it is racy: many copies of mdev can run in parallel. * **12 October 2015 -- BusyBox 1.24.0 (unstable)** [BusyBox 1.24.0](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.24.0.tar.bz2).   ([git](https://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/?h=1_24_stable),   [patches](https://busybox.net/downloads/fixes-1.24.0/),   [how to add a patch](https://busybox.net/fix.html))  Sizes of busybox-1.23.2 and busybox-1.24.0 (with equivalent config, static uclibc build):   ```         text    data     bss     dec     hex filename    860126     486    7272  867884   d3e2c busybox-1.23.2    869074     516    7364  876954   d619a busybox-1.24.0   ```  I would like to feature some less-known useful tools in Busybox.   Let me talk about "nmeter" applet. I find myself using it   surprisingly often. For example, it helped me to correctly parallelize   a very large multiple kernel build job (~30000 kernel builds)   so that all CPUs are loaded, but machine isn't evicting file cache   because it has too many jobs for installed RAM. When dealing with a machine which seems to be sluggish, it takes some time   to pinpoint the cause. It can be lack of free memory. It can be excessive   CPU load. It can be misbehaving (slow) storage or network.   nmeter allows to monitor many such parameters and presents them in a   compact one-line form. This lets you see the time evolution as well.   Here is an example:  ```      # nmeter '%t %c x %x m %[mf] f%p p %[pn] b %b net%[neth0]'   20:51:22 .......... x  837 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net    0    0   20:51:23 .......... x 1195 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net  128    0   20:51:24 .......... x 1687 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:25 .......... x 1829 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net  875   70   20:51:26 U......... x 1567 m 2.2g f   6 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:27 U......... x 1451 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:28 .......... x 1332 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:29 .......... x 1698 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:30 .......... x 1640 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:31 .......... x 1397 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:32 .......... x 1244 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0 4096 net   64    0   20:51:33 U......... x 1660 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net  128    0   20:51:34 U......... x 1793 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:35 .......... x 1583 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   20:51:36 .......... x 1308 m 2.2g f   0 p  377 b    0    0 net   64    0   ```  If CPU load is high, the CPU bar will immediately show this.   %x column shows context switches per second, allowing to detect cases   where processes are waking and waiting on each other excessively.   %[mf] is free memory, and it is smart enough to show actual usable memory:   unlike many other tools, it considers buffer cache as free memory.   %p and %[pn] columns show forks and number of processes, they let you   detect a case where a daemon is respawning continuously.   Two %b numbers are block IO read and write rates. %[neth0] is network IO   rate on the specified interface. More specifiers exist - please read   "nmeter --help" output.  With -d MSEC option and small values of MSEC, this tool allows to see a   detailed view of bursty activity. Sometimes you can literally see every   network packet arriving. To make this possible, this tool is written   so that it reads the minimum of informaion it needs from /proc.   In this example, we can see how a packet arrived to eth0, complete with   its IRQ#30 firing: ```   # nmeter -d10 '%4t irq%30i net%[neth0]'   21:07:58.2301 irq   0 net    0    0   21:07:58.2401 irq   0 net    0    0   21:07:58.2502 irq   0 net    0    0   21:07:58.2601 irq   1 net   64    0   21:07:58.2701 irq   0 net    0    0   21:07:58.2802 irq   0 net    0    0   21:07:58.2902 irq   0 net    0    0   ```  As you see, each update takes about 0.2 millisecond of processing   time. You can run even -d1, if you want. -d0 also works, it is a mode   where updates are continuous. On the other hand, with large update interval,   you can run this tool continuously on a server machine and save its output,   to be able to investigate mysterious drops in performance at a time when   there was no operator present. If you have an oopsing server, it is useful   to have another nmeter instance's output to be constantly printed to   its console, if you want to see what was going on just before oops.   "Is my server occasionally dies in an IRQ storm?" situation.

=======================================================================
              title: Multiple Vulnerabilities
            product: ZTE mobile Hotspot MS910S
 vulnerable version: DL_MF910S_CN_EUV1.00.01
      fixed version: -
         CVE number: CVE-2019-3422
             impact: High

Vendor description:
-------------------
"ZTE Corporation is a global leader in telecommunications and information
technology. Founded in 1985 and listed on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock
Exchanges, the company has been committed to providing integrated end-to-end
innovations to deliver excellence and value to consumers, carriers, businesses
and public sector customers from over 160 countries around the world to enable
increased connectivity and productivity."

Source: <https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/corporate_information>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor recommends to change the hardware and use a newer product.

SEC Consult recommends to remove the device from productive environments.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The hard-coded administrator password was found in the ZTE mobile hotspot
MS910S firmware version "CN_EUV1.00.01", which is available at.
<http://devicedownload.zte.com.cn/support/product/201701161506340/soft/20170116151106465.zip>

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.15.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scalable firmware run-time.

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
An unusual "telnetd" port was identified on an emulated device which led to the
assumption that a backdoor can be opened via the GoAhead web-server.
This conclusion was done because of a blog post from another researcher:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

By partially reverse engineering the binaries of the GoAhead webserver, the
functionality described in the corresponding blog post can be underpinned.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The firmware file (ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin) is using the JFFS2 filesystem which
was extracted. The hardcoded password can be found in the /etc/shadow file
within the firmware:

/_DL_MF910S_CN_EUV1.00.01.exe.extracted/Data/version/_ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin.extracted/jffs2-root/fs_1/etc/shadow

The file content is shown below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
Admin:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
bin::10933:0:99999:7:::
daemon::10933:0:99999:7:::
adm::10933:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
sync:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
shutdown:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
halt:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
uucp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
operator:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
nobody::10933:0:99999:7:::
ap71::10933:0:99999:7:::
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the user "root" and "admin" are using the same weak hardcoded password
"5up".

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was crea-
ted to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
Starting the telnet daemon on the emulated device leads to a listener on a very
unusual port:
[...]
# telnetd
#netstat -tulen
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4719            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
[...]

Because this seems to be not configured on the system by any file, the BusyBox
binary was inspected.

The pseudocode snippet of BusyBox' telnetd function that was generated by Hex-
Rays ARM Decompiler, indicated that this port was hard-coded:
<snip>
dword_788DC = (int)"/bin/login";
  dword_788E0 = (int)"/etc/issue.net";
  v3 = sub_5DBFC(a2, "f:l:Kip:b:F", &dword_788E0, &dword_788DC, &v76, &v75);
  v4 = v3 & 8;
  v5 = v3;
  if ( !(v3 & 8) && !(v3 & 0x40) )
    sub_64A10(v3 & 8);
  if ( (v5 & 0x48) != 64 )
  {
    openlog((const char *)dword_798DC, 1, 24);
    dword_78630 = 2;
  }
  if ( v5 & 0x10 )
    v6 = sub_64FF8(v76);
  else
    v6 = 4719; <------------------------------------- Port "4719"
  if ( !v4 )
  {
    v2 = sub_65578(v75, v6);
    sub_E394(v2, 1);
    sub_D9B0(v2);
    goto LABEL_13;
  }
  dword_788D8 = (int)sub_1C480(0);
  if ( dword_788D8 )
  {
<snip>

This led to the assumption that the GoAhead webserver was modified like
described in the following blog post:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

Inspecting the GoAhead webserver binary reinforces this assumption. The
pseudocode was generated with Hex-Rays ARM Decompiler, like for the prior
BusyBox binary:
<snip>
int __fastcall sub_21D48(int a1)
{
  int v1; // r5
  const char *v2; // r4

  v1 = a1;
  cfg_get("debug_level");
  v2 = (const char *)sub_17DF0(v1, "change_mode", "");
  cfg_set("login_9527", "1");
  if ( !strcmp("1", v2) )
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "1");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 1");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("2", v2) ) <--- change mode "2"
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("telnetd &"); <--------- telnet daemon started
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("3", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_start.sh &");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("4", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_kill.sh &");
  }
  else
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "0");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 0");
  }
  return sub_34374(v1, "success");
}
<snip>

Other scripts could also be started via the webserver, like "rem_start.sh".
This script contains the following lines:

#!/bin/sh
if ps|grep remserial
then
echo "remserial is running.."
else
remserial -p 10005 -r 192.168.1.10 -s "115200 raw" /dev/ttyUSB0 &
fi

That means, that a serial console with the speed of 115200 Baud on port 10005
is started.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following firmware has been tested, which was the latest version available
during the time of the test:
* DL_MF910S_CN_EUV1.00.01

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Debian Bug     : 902724 882258 879732 818497 818499 803097 802702

Busybox, utility programs for small and embedded systems, was affected
by several security vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues.

CVE-2011-5325

    A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation
    of tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the
    current working directory and then follow that symlink when
    extracting other files. This allows for a directory traversal
    attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.

CVE-2013-1813

    When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
    2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the intermediate
    directories are created with incorrect permissions.

CVE-2014-4607

    An integer overflow may occur when processing any variant of a
   "literal run" in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function. Each of these
    three locations is subject to an integer overflow when processing
    zero bytes. This exposes the code that copies literals to memory
    corruption.

CVE-2014-9645

    The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows
    local users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel
    modules via a / (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated
    by an "ifconfig /usbserial up" command or a "mount -t /snd_pcm none
    /" command.

CVE-2016-2147

    Integer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
    malformed RFC1035-encoded domain name, which triggers an
    out-of-bounds heap write.

CVE-2016-2148

    Heap-based buffer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox
    allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors
    involving OPTION_6RD parsing.

CVE-2017-15873

    The get_next_block function in archival/libarchive
    /decompress_bunzip2.c in BusyBox has an Integer Overflow that may
    lead to a write access violation.

CVE-2017-16544

    In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox, the tab
    autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames
    in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing
    any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result
    in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.

CVE-2018-1000517

    BusyBox contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in
    Busybox wget that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow.
    This attack appears to be exploitable via network connectivity.

CVE-2015-9621

    Unziping a specially crafted zip file results in a computation of an
    invalid pointer and a crash reading an invalid address.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.22.0-9+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your busybox packages.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Securely connecting your small business to the outside world is as important
as connecting your internal network devices to one another. Cisco Small
Business RV Series Routers offer virtual private networking (VPN) technology
so your remote workers can connect to your network through a secure Internet
pathway."

Source: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/index.html>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
We want to thank Cisco for the very quick and professional response and great
coordination. Customers are urged to update the firmware of their devices.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH on an emulated device at least.

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.19 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7547, "getaddrinfo() buffer overflow")
was verified by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.23.2 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Vulnerabilities - IoT Inspector Report
Further information can be found in IoT Inspector report:
<https://r.sec-consult.com/ciscoiot>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded Credentials
The following hardcoded hashes were found in the 'shadow' file of the firmware:
root:$1$hPNSjUZA$7eKqEpqVYltt9xJ6f0OGf0:15533:0:99999:7:::
debug-admin:$1$.AAm0iJ4$na9wZwly9pSrdS8MhcGKw/:15541:0:99999:7:::
[...]

The undocumented user 'debug-admin' is also contained in this file.

Starting the dropbear daemon as background process on emulated firmware:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# dropbear -E
# [1109] <timestamp> Running in background
#
# [1112] <timestamp> Child connection from <IP>:52718
[1112] <timestamp> /var must be owned by user or root, and not writable by others
[1112] <timestamp> Password auth succeeded for 'debug-admin' from <IP>:52718
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log on via another host connected to the same network. For this PoC the
password of the debug-admin was changed in the 'shadow' file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost medusa]# ssh debug-admin@<IP> /bin/ash -i
debug-admin@<IP>'s password:
/bin/ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

/tmp $
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'debug-admin' user has the same privileges like 'root'. This can be
determined from the corresponding sudoers file in the firmware:
[...]
## User privilege specification
##
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
debug-admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
[...]

During the communication with Cisco it turned out that:
"Accounts like the 'debug-admin' and 'root' can not be accessed
from console port, CLI or webui".
Therefore, these accounts had no real functionality and cannot be used for
malicious actions.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.19 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402, CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472,
CVE-2015-5277, CVE-2015-8778, CVE-2015-8779, CVE-2017-1000366 and more.

The getaddrinfo() buffer overflow vulnerability was checked with the help of
the exploit code from <https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

# python cve-2015-7547-poc.py &

# chroot /medusa_rootfs/ bin/ash

BusyBox v1.23.2 (2018-11-21 18:22:56 IST) built-in shell (ash)

3) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.23.2 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147, CVE-2018-20679,
CVE-2017-16544 and CVE-2019-5747.
The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device:

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"

We are providing this code as-is. You are responsible for protecting yourself,
your property and data, and others from any risks caused by this code. This
code may cause unexpected and undesirable behavior to occur on your machine.
This code may not detect the vulnerability on your system.

Note that this POC consists of two components: server code and client code.
The server code triggers the vulnerability and therefore will crash the client
code. Note also that it is necessary to set the nameserver to point to the
server code, and doing so could cause other programs that call into the
getaddrinfo() function to crash while testing is underway. This POC code is
provided "as is" with no warranties, whether express or implied, including
without limitation any warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular
use and noninfringement. Google assumes no responsibility for your proper
installation and use of the POC code.
