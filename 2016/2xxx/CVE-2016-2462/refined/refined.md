{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing assignment statement in the OpenSSL/Conscrypt code when updating the AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) during a cipher operation. When a Cipher instance was re-used, the AAD data was not properly reset, leading to incorrect authentication checks in subsequent operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete data reset for AAD during cipher operation re-use.",
      "Incorrect state management in cryptographic operations."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass authentication checks, leading to a situation where a message is believed to be authenticated when it actually is not. This could result in data integrity issues or allow for the injection of malicious data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Reusing a Cipher instance without correctly resetting AAD."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control the cipher operations and the data being passed to the vulnerable AAD update function. Requires some coordinated steps across multiple devices/entities."
  },
  "fixes": [
    {
      "commit_id": "8bec47d2184fca7e8b7337d2a65b2b75a9bc8f54",
      "description": "Fix updateAAD when offset is not 0. Due to AAD data not being reset when a Cipher instance was re-used, this bug was never uncovered by tests that actually exercise this case."
    },
        {
      "commit_id": "a23b05b327b9d8fefc44276c2fa80278ef210c0f",
      "description":"OpenSSLCHipher: multiple calls to updateAAD were ignored. Due to a missing assignment statement, only the first call to updateAAD was honored and the rest were discarded."
    }
  ],
  "cve": "CVE-2016-2462",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability was discovered internally by Google and affects Android devices. The fix was implemented by ensuring AAD data was reset properly when a cipher instance was re-used."
