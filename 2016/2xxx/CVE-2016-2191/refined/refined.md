Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2191:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `bmp_read_rows` function within `pngxrbmp.c`. The code increments or decrements a row pointer (`crt_row`) without proper bounds checking when processing delta escapes in RLE4 encoded BMP images. This allows the pointer to move out of the allocated memory region.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** When `crt_row` moves out of bounds, subsequent operations (specifically `bmp_fread_fn` in absolute mode) attempt to write to the invalid memory location resulting in a crash. The provided proof of concept also shows a `memcpy` being called with invalid address.
*   **Lack of bounds checking:** The core issue is the absence of a check to ensure that `crt_row` stays within the allocated buffer boundaries during delta escape processing. The code performs a check to prevent `b2` to exceed buffer size, however, the value of `b2` is later used in a for loop to increment the `crt_row` pointer which is not bound checked.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash due to the invalid memory access, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, the provided analysis mentions that the out-of-bounds write *may* lead to arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious BMP image:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted BMP image file.
*   **File processing:** The attack requires the vulnerable `optipng` application to process a malicious BMP file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious file:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted BMP file to the user or system running the vulnerable version of optipng. This could involve social engineering, serving the malicious file through a website, or other means of file transfer.
*   **No special privileges:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, as the vulnerability exists in the user-level application itself.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information also references other related CVEs (CVE-2016-3981, CVE-2016-3982) which are also related to heap buffer overflows in the same codebase.
* The vulnerability was fixed in `optipng` version 0.7.6.
* The provided "oob.bmp" file serves as a proof-of-concept and shows the structure necessary to trigger this vulnerability.
