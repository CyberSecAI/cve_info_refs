  "CVE-2016-2392": {
    "description": "QEMU incorrectly handled USB Net emulation support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the USB Net device emulation when processing remote NDIS control messages. Specifically, the code fails to check if the USB configuration descriptor object is NULL before accessing it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged attacker within the guest operating system can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service by crashing the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is from within a virtualized guest OS."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user inside the guest OS."
