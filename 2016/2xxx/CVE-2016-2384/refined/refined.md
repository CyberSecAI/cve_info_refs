    "Description": "Double free vulnerability in the snd_usbmidi_create function in sound/usb/midi.c allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving an invalid USB descriptor.",
    "Root cause": "The ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly performed a double-free.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Double-free vulnerability"

    "Impact": "A local attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. A malicious USB device could cause a kernel crash in the alsa usb-audio driver.",
