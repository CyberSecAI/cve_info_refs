Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2343:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Patterson Dental Eaglesoft software utilizes a hard-coded database password that is the same across all installations. This means every instance of the software uses the same credentials for database access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The primary vulnerability is the use of hard-coded database credentials.
*   **Shared Credentials:** The same credentials are used across all installations, meaning if the credentials are compromised on one system, all systems are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials can gain access to the database, which contains sensitive patient information.
*   **Complete compromise:**  The attacker can read, modify or delete patient data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the database server to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Credential Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the hard-coded database credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:**  An attacker needs to be able to connect to the database server. This could be from an internal network or potentially from the internet if the database server is exposed.
*   **Knowledge of the Hard-coded Credentials:** The attacker must know the hard-coded username and password.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Justin Shafer.
*   The vulnerability is present because the database credentials cannot be changed by an administrator without breaking the software's access to the database.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity level.
*   The CERT/CC is not aware of a full solution to this problem, and provides mitigations such as network access restrictions.
