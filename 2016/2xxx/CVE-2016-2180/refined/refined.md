  "CVE-2016-2180": {
    "description": "The TS_OBJ_print_bio function in crypto/ts/ts_lib.c in the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) implementation in OpenSSL through 1.0.2h allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted time-stamp file that is mishandled by the \"openssl ts\" command.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or other unspecified impact via crafted time-stamp file.",
     "attack_vector": "Remote",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send crafted time-stamp files to a vulnerable service that uses the openssl ts command.",
    "root_cause": "The TS_OBJ_print_bio function misuses OBJ_obj2txt. The returned length value is not the amount of data written, causing OOB reads when large OIDs are present."
