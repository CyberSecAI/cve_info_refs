Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2817:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper restrictions within the WebExtension sandbox feature of Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, the `chrome.tabs.create` and `chrome.tabs.update` APIs do not adequately control principal inheritance during calls to these methods.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient principal inheritance control:** The core weakness lies in the flawed implementation of principal inheritance checks within the WebExtension APIs, specifically `chrome.tabs.create` and `chrome.tabs.update`.
*   **Universal XSS (UXSS):** The lack of proper restrictions makes it possible to conduct a Universal Cross-Site Scripting attack.
*   **javascript: and data: URLs:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to use crafted extensions that leverage `javascript:` and `data:` URLs which inherit the parent's permissions

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary code within the context of the user or other extension.
*  **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** A malicious extension could exploit the vulnerability to conduct XSS attacks.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Malicious extensions could use this vulnerability to elevate their privileges and potentially perform actions they wouldn't normally have the access to perform.
* **Injection of Content**: The vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject content into other extensions, particularly those that load content within browser tabs.
* **Sensitive data access:** The vulnerability might allow for the theft of sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted web extension installed by the user and could be exploited by remote attackers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Malicious extension:** The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious web extension that exploits the vulnerable `chrome.tabs.create` and `chrome.tabs.update` APIs.
*   **User interaction:** The victim needs to install the malicious extension for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2016-1780, where the lack of JavaScript access restriction to orientation and motion data allowed remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about a device's physical environment.
*   The vulnerability is present in Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 46.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Muneaki Nishimura.
*   The issue is addressed in Firefox 46 and later versions, through fixes that properly restrict principal inheritance.
*   This vulnerability is rated as moderate severity by both SUSE and Mozilla.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted extension that accesses a `javascript:` or `data:` URL.
