Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2016-2271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Xen handles guest VM entries, specifically when the instruction pointer (RIP) is non-canonical.
*   VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions) within Xen enforces that the RIP must be canonical when entering a 64-bit mode guest. This check occurs even if an exception is immediately injected.
*   If a guest operating system allows mapping virtual memory immediately below the canonical/non-canonical boundary, a non-canonical RIP can occur during normal user mode execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Canonical RIP Enforcement Bypass**: Xen's VMX implementation incorrectly enforces RIP canonicity even when the guest will immediately encounter an exception and not use the RIP for normal instruction execution.
*   **Crash on Invalid RIP:** A non-canonical RIP during VM entry leads to a fatal VM entry failure, causing the guest to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious user-mode code within an HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guest can trigger this vulnerability, leading to a guest crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest User Mode Code**: The attack vector is through malicious code executing within the user mode of a HVM guest operating system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **HVM Guest Access**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within an HVM guest.
*   **Memory Mapping**: The attacker needs to have the ability to map memory in the virtual address space of the guest immediately below the canonical/non-canonical boundary
*   **Intel/Cyrix CPU**: The targeted system must be running on Intel or Cyrix processors, since ARM and AMD systems are unaffected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that all Xen versions are affected, but the issue is specific to HVM guests and Intel/Cyrix CPUs.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
*   The fix involves a workaround, as a better architecturally correct solution was not found.

The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201604-03) and Debian security advisory (DSA 3519-1) both list CVE-2016-2271 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed by updates to the Xen packages.
