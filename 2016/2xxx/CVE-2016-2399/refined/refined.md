Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in `libquicktime` when processing a specially crafted MP4 file. Specifically, the overflow occurs when parsing the `hdlr` atom within the MP4 file structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The size calculation of the `hdlr` atom is not properly validated, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow results in a small memory allocation.
- Memory Corruption: Subsequently, when the application tries to write to the undersized buffer, memory corruption occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to a crash of the application due to the memory corruption. This makes the software unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious MP4 File: The primary attack vector is a crafted MP4 file that contains a malformed `hdlr` atom.
- File Processing: The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable application attempts to parse and process this MP4 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved by:
    -  Email attachment
    -  Hosting the file on a website that the user visits
    -  Any other means where the application parses attacker controlled data
