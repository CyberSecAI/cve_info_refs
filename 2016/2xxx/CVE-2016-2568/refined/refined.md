Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2568:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way `pkexec` handles the `--user nonpriv` option, specifically when combined with the `TIOCSTI` ioctl.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**
- When `pkexec` is used to execute a program as an unprivileged user (`--user nonpriv`), the executed program retains access to the parent terminal's input buffer.
- This allows the unprivileged program to use the `TIOCSTI` ioctl to inject arbitrary characters into the parent terminal's input buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious program run via `pkexec --user nonpriv` can inject commands into the parent terminal's input buffer. 
- When `pkexec` exits, these injected commands are then executed by the parent shell, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- An attacker can gain root privileges by injecting commands that would normally require root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack. The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute programs using `pkexec`.
- The attacker must have the ability to compile and run their own code, or use existing tools.
- The attacker does not need to have elevated privileges initially. They can use a regular user account.
- An attacker must also be able to pass the tty ownership check (as mentioned in a comment), which is bypassed by the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability uses the `TIOCSTI` ioctl, which is meant to push characters into the input buffer of a terminal.
- The `pkexec` program does not properly restrict this ioctl when running a program as a non-privileged user.
- The vulnerability is similar to an older vulnerability in "su", which was fixed using `setsid()`, and in "sudo", which was fixed by using the `use_pty` flag.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects multiple Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- A kernel-side fix was considered, but it seems no fix was applied to the vulnerable `pkexec` programs in some distributions.
- Some distributions have marked this issue as "ignored" or "deferred" due to the perceived low impact or complexity.
- While the CVSS score is high (7.8), the "Attack Complexity" is marked "High" which suggests that a successful exploit requires some degree of knowledge and preparation.
