Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the SQL editor of phpMyAdmin. Specifically, a crafted SQL query could inject malicious code that is not properly handled and leads to an XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The SQL editor processes user input, and if the input contains malicious JavaScript code, it is rendered within the user's browser.
*  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize or encode user input before displaying it, allowing the execution of malicious scripts within the context of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they view the crafted SQL query in the editor.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, gaining access to the user's account.
*   **Phishing:** Redirect the user to a malicious page
*   **Data Manipulation:** Modify data displayed in the interface, leading to potential misinformation or confusion.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted SQL Query:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query containing JavaScript code.
*   **SQL Editor:** The malicious query is input into the SQL editor of phpMyAdmin.
*   **Reflected XSS:** When the user views or interacts with the malicious query in the editor, the JavaScript is executed within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of phpMyAdmin to access the SQL editor and trigger the vulnerability, bypassing protection mechanisms that block non-logged-in users.
*   **Ability to Input SQL:** The attacker needs the ability to input SQL queries into the SQL editor.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in phpMyAdmin version 4.5.4 and later.
*   The provided commit logs ([0a24f92d081033576bfdd9d4bdec1a54501734c1](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/0a24f92d081033576bfdd9d4bdec1a54501734c1) and [11496890d7e21786cbfd9fd17ab968f498116b3f](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/11496890d7e21786cbfd9fd17ab968f498116b3f)) address the issue by setting the correct content type for JSON responses in multiple files, preventing browsers from interpreting the response as HTML and attempting to execute the Javascript and explicitly setting the datatype as json in the request so jQuery knows to expect JSON and parse it.
*   The vulnerability is considered "non-critical" because it requires a logged-in user to trigger.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) and CWE-661 (Improper Handling of  Unexpected Data Type).
