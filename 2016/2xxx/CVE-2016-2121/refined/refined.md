Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is weak permissions set on certain files and directories by the `redis` package. These files could contain sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that configuration files (`/etc/redis.conf`, `/etc/redis-sentinel.conf`) and the data directory (`/var/lib/redis`) had overly permissive access control lists (ACLs). Specifically, the configuration files were world-readable (`-rw-r--r--`) and the data directory was world-executable (`drwxr-xr-x`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local, unprivileged attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the configuration files (which might contain passwords or other secrets), or access/modify data in the redis data directory. This could lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the system's confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker needs to have a shell on the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system but not necessarily any elevated privileges at first. They only require the ability to read the affected files and directories.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves changing permissions on `/etc/redis.conf` and `/etc/redis-sentinel.conf` to 640 (rw-r-----).
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity by Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton) via the RHSA-2017:3226 security advisory.
*   The issue was originally reported in bug 1374700.
