{
  "CVE-2016-2094": {
    "description": "A read-timeout flaw was found in the HTTPS NIO Connector handling of SSL handshakes. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could create a socket and cause a thread to remain occupied indefinitely so long as the socket remained open (denial of service).",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The HTTPS NIO Connector does not implement a timeout mechanism when reading SSL handshakes from a client.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of read timeout on SSL handshake",
        "Resource exhaustion"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service by creating a socket and holding it open without sending handshake data, thereby tying up server threads indefinitely.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require authentication or any special privileges and can trigger the vulnerability by establishing a network connection.",
	  "notes": "This issue was discovered by Aaron Ogburn of Red Hat."
    }
