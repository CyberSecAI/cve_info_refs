# Cacti: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201607-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Cacti, the worst of
which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/cacti** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.8h** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.8h** |

### Background

Cacti is a complete frontend to rrdtool.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Cacti. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or remote authenticated users could bypass
intended access restrictions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.8h"

```
