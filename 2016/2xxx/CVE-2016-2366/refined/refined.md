  "CVE-2016-2366": {
    "description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A malicious server or an attacker who intercepts the network traffic can send invalid data to trigger this vulnerability and cause a crash.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `command_table` function within `mxit/formcmds.c` of Pidgin, where the number of rows and columns for a table are received from the server and used to access an array. The lack of proper validation of these values allows an attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (application crash)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious server sending crafted MXIT data",
      "Attacker intercepting network traffic and sending crafted MXIT data"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or intercept the communication with the Pidgin client via the MXit protocol in order to send the malicious data."
