{
  "CVE-2016-2167": {
    "Description": "svnserve, the svn:// protocol server, can optionally use the Cyrus SASL library for authentication, integrity protection, and encryption. Due to a programming oversight, authentication against Cyrus SASL would permit the remote user to specify a realm string which is a prefix of the expected realm string.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A programming oversight in the canonicalization of the username and realm provided by the remote end, specifically when using Cyrus SASL for authentication. The server incorrectly used the remote-specified realm if it was a prefix of the expected realm.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation/canonicalization of the realm string during SASL authentication.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A user with valid credentials for a realm that is a prefix of the repository's realm can successfully authenticate to the repository, potentially gaining unauthorized access.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can specify a crafted realm string during the SASL authentication process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid credentials for a realm that is a prefix of the target repository's realm. The svnserve server must be configured to use SASL authentication and the attacker must be able to connect to the server."
