{
  "CVE-2016-2813": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Mozilla Firefox on Android does not properly restrict JavaScript access to orientation and motion data, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about a device's physical environment, and possibly discover PIN values, via a crafted web site, a similar issue to CVE-2016-1780.",
    "details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on JavaScript's access to device orientation and motion sensor data in Firefox for Android. This allows scripts to gather data about the device's physical environment without proper authorization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access controls for device motion and orientation sensors, which allowed JavaScript code to read sensor data without explicit user permission. This also includes the ability to read this data even when the tab was in the background.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to infer user touch actions (tap, scroll, zoom) and potentially even discern entered PIN codes by analyzing sensor data streams. This poses a significant threat to user privacy and security.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted website containing malicious JavaScript code that accesses device motion and orientation sensors. By simply visiting the malicious page, the attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick the user to visit the site via Firefox for Android in order to exploit this vulnerability. No special capabilities besides having basic web development skills are needed."
