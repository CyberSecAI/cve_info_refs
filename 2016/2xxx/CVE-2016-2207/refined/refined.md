{
  "Root cause": "Symantec's antivirus software uses an outdated version (4.1.4) of the unrar library for RAR archive decompression. This version has multiple known memory corruption vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions (e.g., 5.3.11).",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Use of outdated third-party code with known vulnerabilities",
    "Memory corruption vulnerabilities in the unrar library",
     "Specifically, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability related to Unpack::ShortLZ() and the PlaceA[] array is mentioned."
  ],
  "Impact": "Remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on Windows and root on Linux and Mac.",
  "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted RAR archive files.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted RAR archive to the Symantec software for processing. The Symantec antivirus software unpacks untrusted binaries received over the network as part of the scan process, so this can be achieved by sending such file."
