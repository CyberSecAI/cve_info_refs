{
  "CVE-2016-2572": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Official Description": "http.cc in Squid 4.x before 4.0.7 relies on the HTTP status code after a response-parsing failure, which allows remote HTTP servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed response."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "Squid incorrectly handles errors when parsing an HTTP response, leading to an assertion failure.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Incorrect error handling after failing to parse an HTTP response."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit).",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "By sending a malformed HTTP response to a Squid proxy."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a remote HTTP server that can send a crafted response to the squid proxy.",
        "Affected component": "http.cc in Squid"
    }
  }
}
