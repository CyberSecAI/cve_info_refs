Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user-supplied input in IBM Forms Experience Builder when configured with non-default settings. This allows for a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation, which allows an attacker to send malicious HTTP requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks:** The vulnerability can be exploited to perform XSS attacks.
*   **Web cache poisoning:** Attackers could potentially poison web caches.
*   **Other malicious activities:** The vulnerability can be used to perform other malicious activities.
*   **Potential for unauthorized actions:** Attackers could perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Site:** The attacker needs to persuade an authenticated user to visit a malicious web site.
*   **Malformed HTTP Request:** The attacker then sends a malformed HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Position:** Remote attacker
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to create a malicious website.
    *   Ability to craft malformed HTTP requests.
    *   Ability to lure an authenticated user to their malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists when IBM Forms Experience Builder is configured with non-default settings.
*   The fix involves adding a randomly generated, hard-to-guess, single-use numerical value as part of the header in REST API requests. This mitigates the CSRF vulnerability by ensuring the request comes from the user's session.
*   A temporary workaround exists to disable the protection. This workaround is not recommended as it leaves the system vulnerable.
*   Affected products include IBM Forms Experience Builder versions 8.5, 8.5.1, and 8.6.x.
*   The CVSS vector is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), which denotes Network attack vector, high attack complexity, low privileges required, user interaction needed, no change to scope and high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
