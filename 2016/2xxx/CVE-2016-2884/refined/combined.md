# Security Bulletin: IBM Forms Experience Builder vulnerable to CSRF when configured with non default settings (CVE-2016-2884)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A cross-site request forgery attack is possible when configured with non default settings, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:**  [CVE-2016-2884](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2884)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Forms Experience Builder is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, when configured with non-default settings, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. By persuading an authenticated user to visit a malicious web site, a remote attacker could send a malformed HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site scripting attacks, web cache poisoning, and other malicious activities.

CVSS Base Score: 7.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112864> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM Forms Experience Builder 8.5

IBM Forms Experience Builder 8.5.1

IBM Forms Experience Builder 8.6.x

## Remediation/Fixes

Applying the following fix will resolve the issue, but can impact any application that uses the [Forms Experience Builder REST API](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6KJL_8.6.3/FEB/ref_rest_api_ref.html) (both Data and Application management.)

| **Product** | **VRMF** | **APAR** | **Remediation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Forms Experience Builder | 8.5.0.\* | LO89686 | To receive the fix for these versions, contact IBM Support. |
| IBM Forms Experience Builder | 8.5.1.\* | LO89686 |
| IBM Forms Experience Builder | 8.6.\* | LO89686 | [Download and Install 8.6.3.1](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/Lotus/IBM+Forms+Experience+Builder&function=fixId&fixids=8.6.3.1-FormsExpBldr&downloadMethod=ddp) |

**NOTE**: For users with applications that utilize the REST APIs, the ability to temporarily revert the behaviour exists by setting the ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.ProtectSensitiveActions configuration option to false. This is not recommended as it can leave the system open to this vulnerability.

To remediate applications that use the Forms Experience Builder REST API, you must add a randomly generated, difficult to guess single-use numerical value as part of the header. See *Table 1* in the [Data access REST API](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6KJL_8.6.3/FEB/ref_data_access_rest_api.html) and [Application management REST API](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6KJL_8.6.3/FEB/ref_rest_api_auto_deploy.html) for specific examples.
