Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue in the AOSP Email application (UnifiedEmail package). The application was not properly handling cached file attachments when the content URI pointed to the EmailProvider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability lies in the application's ability to access and cache email attachments without proper authorization when the content URI points to EmailProvider. This allows other applications to potentially access these cached files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Due to the lack of access control, other malicious apps can potentially gain access to sensitive data contained in cached email attachments, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A local malicious application could gain unauthorized access to private data contained in cached email attachments, potentially including sensitive information from emails.
*   **Privacy Breach:** User's private email attachments could be accessed by unauthorized applications, leading to a privacy breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious App:** A malicious application, installed on the same device as the vulnerable email client, can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Access to Cached Files:** The malicious app can access the cached files via the file system due to the flawed caching mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or discover the file paths of the cached attachments.
*   **Normal User Permissions:** Exploitation does not require root permissions. The attacker can leverage the permissions of a normal app.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves preventing the application from caching file attachments when the content URI points to EmailProvider. The patch also adds analytics for the errors.
*   **Fix Details:** The fix is implemented by modifying `UnifiedEmail` package and the `Email` package.
*   **Affected Versions**: The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0 and 6.0.1.
