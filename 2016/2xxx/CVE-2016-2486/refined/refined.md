Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `Mediaserver` component, specifically within the code related to processing media files and data. The issue is a buffer size check in `(gsm|g711)dec`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Buffer Size Check:** The code lacks proper validation of buffer sizes before their usage in the `(gsm|g711)dec` decoder. This could lead to memory corruption if the provided data causes an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the `Mediaserver` process, which operates with elevated system privileges. This can allow a malicious app to access capabilities it wouldn't normally have (e.g. signature or signatureOrSystem level permissions).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Media Files:** An attacker could exploit this by providing specially crafted media files, potentially through various means:
    -  **MMS:** Sending an MMS message containing the malicious file.
    -  **Web Browsing:** Serving the malicious media file through a webpage.
    -  **Other media processing services:** Any other app that uses mediaserver to process media files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to deliver a specially crafted media file to the affected device. This can be done remotely or locally via an app with media processing capabilities.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to launch the attack, exploiting the vulnerability in the context of the mediaserver process.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code commit message `codecs: check OMX buffer size before use in (gsm|g711)dec`  indicates that the fix involves adding proper checks on the buffer sizes, to avoid writing out of bounds of the buffer memory, thus preventing the memory corruption vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as **High** severity as the attacker can gain access to elevated system application privileges.
