    {
      "cve": "CVE-2016-2426",
      "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability in the Framework component could allow an application to access sensitive information. This issue is rated Moderate severity because it could be used to improperly access to data without permission.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how `ContentResolver#getCurrentSyncs` handles permission checks. Specifically, if a caller does not hold the `GET_ACCOUNTS` permission, the method returns a `SyncInfo` object that does not contain any account information. However, it does not completely prevent information leakage.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "A local application can improperly access sensitive information by using `ContentResolver#getCurrentSyncs` without `GET_ACCOUNTS` permission.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious application can call the `ContentResolver#getCurrentSyncs` without holding the `GET_ACCOUNTS` permission."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "A local application installed on the device is required. The application does not need any special permissions to trigger the vulnerability."
