Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how QEMU's Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) backend handles requests for entropy. Specifically, it involves an arbitrary stack-based allocation, which can lead to memory corruption when generating random bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Stack-Based Allocation:**  The core issue is the improper allocation of memory on the stack within the PRNG backend. This allows for potentially larger-than-expected memory allocations.
- **Memory Corruption:** Due to the stack allocation issue, the random bytes generated can corrupt memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A user or process within the guest operating system can exploit the vulnerability to crash the QEMU process. This leads to a denial of service, effectively halting the virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest Interaction:** The attack is initiated from within a guest operating system running in the QEMU environment. A user or process inside the guest needs to trigger the vulnerable PRNG function to request entropy for random number generation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code inside the guest OS. The vulnerability is triggered when the guest requests entropy from the PRNG.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The Ubuntu security notice indicates that this issue affects Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 15.10 and 16.04 LTS. The Gentoo advisory specifies versions of `app-emulation/qemu` prior to `2.5.0-r2` are affected.
*   **Specific Code Location:** The Openwall mailing list and Red Hat bugzilla reference a specific commit that fixed the vulnerability: [http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=60253ed1e6ec6d8e5ef2efe7bf755f475dce9956](http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=60253ed1e6ec6d8e5ef2efe7bf755f475dce9956)
*   **Mitigation:** Updating to the patched QEMU version is required to fix the issue. The Ubuntu security notice provides details about specific package versions that contain the fix.
*   **Severity:** Red Hat rated this vulnerability as having a "Low" security impact, noting that it could result in a denial of service. Other sources indicate the same.

In summary, CVE-2016-2858 is a vulnerability in QEMU's PRNG backend allowing a guest OS user to crash QEMU through a memory corruption flaw caused by excessive stack allocation when requesting entropy.
