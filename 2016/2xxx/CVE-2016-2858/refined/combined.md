## Details

Zuozhi Fzz discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB OHCI emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2391](/security/CVE-2016-2391))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB Net emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2392](/security/CVE-2016-2392))

Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB Net emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak

host memory bytes. ([CVE-2016-2538](/security/CVE-2016-2538))

Hongke Yang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NE2000 emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2841](/security/CVE-2016-2841))

Ling Liu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled IP checksum routines. An

attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak host memory bytes.

([CVE-2016-2857](/security/CVE-2016-2857))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the PRNG back-end support.

An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04

LTS, Ubuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-2858](/security/CVE-2016-2858))

Wei Xiao and Qinghao Tang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled access

in the VGA module. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this

issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU

is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor

profile. ([CVE-2016-3710](/security/CVE-2016-3710))

Zuozhi Fzz discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled access in the VGA

module. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU

is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor

profile. ([CVE-2016-3712](/security/CVE-2016-3712))

Oleksandr Bazhaniuk discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled Luminary

Micro Stellaris ethernet controller emulation. A remote attacker could use

this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-4001](/security/CVE-2016-4001))

Oleksandr Bazhaniuk discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled MIPSnet

controller emulation. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU

to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4002](/security/CVE-2016-4002))

Donghai Zdh discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Task Priority

Register(TPR). A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue

to possibly leak host memory bytes. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04

LTS, Ubuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-4020](/security/CVE-2016-4020))

Du Shaobo discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB EHCI emulation

support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-4037](/security/CVE-2016-4037))

# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201604-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.0-r2** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Subject: CVE request Qemu: rng-random: arbitrary stack based allocation
 leading to corruption

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the Pseudo Random Number Generator(PRNG) back-end
support is vulnerable to an arbitrary stack based allocation and memory
corruption via random bytes issue. It could occur when a guest requests for
entropy for random number generation.

A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=60253ed1e6ec6d8e5ef2efe7bf755f475dce9956>

Thank you.

This looks like a linker problem. Maybe upgrading to the newest glibc, binutils, and gcc 3.2 solves this (2.2.5-r6, 2.13.90.0.4, 3.2), I dunno.  There is neither in bugzilla.ximian.org nor in Mono's mailing list any reference to such a build problem (at least I haven't found any).  Btw, I just also submitted an ebuild for mono 0.15 and boehm-gc 6.1alpha5 (bugs #7101 and #7109). I saw the ebuild in this bug report too late. The big difference between the ebuild here and the one which I posted is that mine links against the boehm-gc, like the official rpms (you need the newest boehm-gc for this).
