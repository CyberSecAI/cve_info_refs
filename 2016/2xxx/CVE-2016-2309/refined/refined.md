- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iRZ RUH2 device allows authorized users to remotely update the firmware with an unvalidated patch. This lack of validation on the firmware update allows attackers to upload malicious firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload with dangerous type (CWE-434). Specifically, the lack of validation on the firmware update allows an attacker to overwrite the device firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could corrupt the firmware of the serial-to-Ethernet converters and network routers, potentially disrupting substation communications and network operations.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the firmware update mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user with the capability to upload firmware to the device.
