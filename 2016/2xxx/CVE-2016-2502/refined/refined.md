  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm USB driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to potentially execute arbitrary code within the kernel context, bypassing security measures."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges. This can potentially cause a permanent device compromise requiring reflashing the operating system.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local malicious application that has already compromised a privileged process.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to install and execute a malicious application on the target device. Additionally, the application must first compromise a privileged process before exploiting the driver vulnerability."
