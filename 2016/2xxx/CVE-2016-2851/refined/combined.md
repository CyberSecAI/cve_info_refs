Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private conversations
over instant messaging by providing:

**Encryption**
No one else can read your instant messages.
**Authentication**
You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
**Deniability**
The messages you send do *not* have digital signatures that are
checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after a
conversation to make them look like they came from you. However,
*during* a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
he sees are authentic and unmodified.

**Perfect forward secrecy**
If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is compromised.

## News

9 Mar 2016

Security update: libotr version 4.1.1

Versions 4.1.0 and earlier of libotr in 64-bit builds contain an integer
overflow security flaw. This flaw could potentially be exploited by a
remote attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow and subsequently for
arbitrary code to be executed on the user's machine.

CVE-2016-2851 has been assigned to this issue.

Please upgrade to libotr version 4.1.1 immediately.

Users of libotr packages in Linux and \*BSD distributions should see updated packages shortly.

This security release includes the following updates:

* Fix an integer overflow bug that can cause a heap buffer overflow (and
  from there remote code execution) on 64-bit platforms
* Fix possible free() of an uninitialized pointer
* Be stricter about parsing v3 fragments
* Add a testsuite ("make check" to run it), but only on Linux for now,
  since it uses Linux-specific features such as epoll
* Fix a memory leak when reading a malformed instance tag file
* Protocol documentation clarifications

pidgin-otr version 4.0.2 released

This point release includes the following updates:

* Fix use-after-free issue during SMP
* Updated Spanish, German, Norwegian Bokm친l translations
* New Danish translation
* The Windows binary has been linked with updated versions of libotr, libgcrypt, libgpg-error, and other supporting libraries

## Downloads

### OTR library and toolkit

This is the portable OTR Messaging Library, as well as the toolkit to
help you forge messages. You need this library in order to use the other
OTR software on this page. [Note that some binary packages, particularly
Windows, do not have a separate library package, but just include the library
and toolkit in the packages below.] The current version is 4.1.1.

([sig](libotr-4.1.1.tar.gz.asc))
### Java OTR library

This is the Java version of the OTR library. This is for developers of Java applications that want to add support for OTR. End users do not require this package. It's still early days, but you can download [java-otr version 0.1.0](java-otr-0.1.0.tar.gz) ([sig](java-otr-0.1.0.tar.gz.asc)).

### OTR plugin for Pidgin

This is a plugin for Pidgin 2.x which implements
Off-the-Record Messaging over any IM network Pidgin supports.
The current version is 4.0.2.

### OTR localhost AIM proxy

This software is no longer supported. Please use an IM client with native support for OTR.

This is a localhost proxy you can use with almost any AIM client in order
to participate in Off-the-Record conversations. The current version is
0.3.1, which means it's still a long way from done. Read the README
file carefully. Some things it's still missing:

* Username/password authentication to the proxy
* Having the proxy be able to use *outgoing* proxies itself
* Support for protocols other than AIM/ICQ
* Configurability of the proxy types and ports it uses

But it should work for most people. Please send feedback to [the
otr-users mailing list](https://lists.cypherpunks.ca/mailman/listinfo/otr-users/), or to the dev team.
You may need the above library packages.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What implementations of Off-the-Record Messaging are there?**
Please see our [OTR-enabled software](software.php) page.
The OTR functionality is separated into the
Off-the-Record Messaging Library (libotr), which is an LGPL-licensed
library that can be used to (hopefully) easily produce OTR plugins for
other IM software, or for other applications entirely.
**What is the license for the OTR software?**
The Off-the-Record Messaging Library is licensed under version 2.1
of the [GNU Lesser General
Public License](http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.txt). The Off-the-Record Toolkit, the pidgin-otr plugin,
and the OTR proxy are licensed under version 2 of the [GNU General Public
License](http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.txt).
**How is this different from the pidgin-encryption plugin?**
The pidgin-encryption plugin provides encryption and authentication,
but not deniability or perfect forward secrecy. If an attacker or a
virus gets access to your machine, all of your *past*
pidgin-encryption conversations are retroactively compromised. Further,
since all of the messages are digitally signed, there is
difficult-to-deny proof that you said what you did: not what we want
for a supposedly private conversation!
**How is this different from Trillian's SecureIM?**
SecureIM doesn't provide any kind of authentication at all! You
really have no idea (in any kind of secure way) to whom you're speaking,
or if there is a "man in the middle" reading all of your messages.
**How is this different from SILC?**
SILC uses a completely separate network of servers and underlying
network protocol. In some environments, such as firewalled or corporate
setups, where a local proprietary IM protocol may be in use, SILC may
not be available. Further, in its normal mode of operation, all SILC messages
are shared with the SILC servers; if you want to send messages that can only
be read by the person with whom you're communicating, you need to either
(1) arrange a pre-shared secret in advance (which hampers perfect forward
secrecy), or (2) be able to do a direct peer-to-peer connection to the other
person's client, in order to do a key agreement (which may not be possible in
a NAT or firewall situation).

Package        : libotr
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2851

Markus Vervier of X41 D-Sec GmbH discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability in libotr, an off-the-record (OTR) messaging library, in
the way how the sizes of portions of incoming messages were stored. A
remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending crafted messages to an
application that is using libotr to perform denial of service attacks
(application crash), or potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.2.1-1+deb7u2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.0-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libotr packages.

Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) Security Advisory 2016-01

Integer overflow vulnerability in libotr

Versions 4.1.0 and earlier of libotr in 64-bit builds contain an integer
overflow security flaw.  This flaw could potentially be exploited by a
remote attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow and subsequently for
arbitrary code to be executed on the user's machine.

In several places in proto.c, the sizes of portions of incoming messages
were stored in variables of type int or unsigned int instead of size_t.
If a message arrives with very large sizes (for example unsigned int
datalen = UINT_MAX), then constructions like malloc(datalen+1) will turn
into malloc(0), which on some architectures returns a non-NULL pointer,
but UINT_MAX bytes will get written to that pointer.

CVE-2016-2851 has been assigned to this issue.

The recommended course of action is to upgrade libotr to version
4.1.1 immediately.  The new version can be obtained here:

Source code:
    <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/libotr-4.1.1.tar.gz>
gpg signature:
    <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/libotr-4.1.1.tar.gz.asc>

git repository:
    git://git.otr.im/libotr.git (tag 4.1.1)

A new Windows binary of pidgin-otr (4.0.2) linked to libotr 4.1.1 is
available; however, as the Windows version is a 32-bit build, it is not
susceptible to the above flaw.  Windows users may wish to upgrade in any
event in order to take advantages of other fixes in libotr 4.1.1 and

**Advisory-URL**: https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2016-001-libotr/

### Summary and Impact

A remote attacker may crash or execute arbitrary code in libotr by sending large OTR messages. While processing specially crafted messages, attacker controlled data on the heap is written out of bounds. No special user interaction or authorization is necessary in default

configurations.

### Product Description

Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging is a cryptographic protocol used in well-known instant messaging clients such as Pidgin, ChatSecure, Adium and others. It is designed to work on top of existing protocols and used worldwide to provide secure communication in insecure environments. OTR is regarded as highly secure and according to documents revealed by Edward Snowden one of the protocols that the NSA is not able to decrypt via cryptanalysis. The most commonly used implementation of OTR is 칙춮libotr칙춯 which is a pure C code implementation of the OTR protocol.

### Analysis

During a manual code review X41 D-Sec GmbH discovered a remotely exploitable vulnerability in libotr.

By sending large messages, an integer overflow can be triggered which subsequently leads to a heap overflow on 64 bit architectures.

When a message of type OTRL\_MSGSTATE\_DATA is received during an established OTR conversation, this message is passed to function otrl\_proto\_accept\_data in src/message.c line 1347:

```
	case OTRL_MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED:
		extrakey = gcry_malloc_secure(OTRL_EXTRAKEY_BYTES);
		err = otrl_proto_accept_data(&plaintext, &tlvs, context,
		                  message, &flags, extrakey);

```

After base64 decoding the message and reading various values from it, the length of a payload is read into a variable of type 칙춮unsigned int칙춯 in file proto.c line 784:

```
read_int(datalen);

```

It is checked that the message buffer will contain at least a 칙춮datalen칙춯 number of bytes using read\_int in proto.c line 785:

```
	require_len(datalen);

```

The macros 칙춮read\_int칙춯 and 칙춮required\_len칙춯 are defined in src/serial.h:

```
	#define require_len(l) do { \
		if (lenp < (l)) goto invval; \
	    } while(0)

	#define read_int(x) do { \
		require_len(4); \
		(x) = (((unsigned int)bufp[0]) << 24) | (bufp[1] << 16) | (bufp[2] << 8) | bufp[3]; \
		bufp += 4; lenp -= 4; \
	    } while(0)

```

4 bytes are read from the message buffer and interpreted as unsigned int value.

Subsequently a buffer of size datalen+1 is allocated using malloc in proto.c line 786:

```
    data = malloc(datalen+1);
    if (!data) {
        err = gcry_error(GPG_ERR_ENOMEM);
        goto err;
    }

```

Now data from the message is copied into this buffer using memmove in line 791:

```
    memmove(data, bufp, datalen);

```

The vulnerability is triggered if a value of 0xFFFFFFFF (MAX\_UINT) is read from the message buffer. As datalen is of size 32-bit (unsigned int) the operation 칙춮datalen+1칙춯 will wrap around before being passed to malloc. This will effectively result in a zero allocation ( malloc(0) ) which is valid in common implementations of malloc on the x86\_64 architecture. As no addition is done in the value passed to the call to memmove, 4 gigabytes of data are copied out of bounds to the heap location pointed to by data.

### Proof of Concept

In order to successfully trigger the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send a data message of more than 5.5 gigabytes to a victim in order to pass the check 칙춮require\_len(datalen)칙춯. Due to the support of fragmented OTR messages assembled by libotr this is possible in practice. By sending 275 messages of size 20MB each, X41 was able to make libotr process such a data message successfully on a system with 8GB of ram and 15GB of swap space. As data types for lenp and other lengths of the message are 64 bit large size\_t types on x86\_64 architectures huge messages of multiple gigabytes are possible. Sending such a message to a pidgin client took only a few minutes on a fast network connection without visible signs of any attack to a user.

A proof of concept triggering a heap overwrite and crash in the pidgin-otr plugin for the popular pidgin messenger on x86\_64 Linux architectures is [available](https://www.x41-dsec.de/static/misc/otr-heap-overflow-poc.py).

The crash occurs due to the overwrite hitting unmapped memory. Using techniques such as heap grooming, X41 was able to inflate the heap to more than 4GB and overwrite function pointers and arguments on the heap in order to take over control flow. A working exploit will not be published at this time.

Interaction by users beyond having enabled OTR is not necessary as OTR sessions are automatically established with anyone by default in Pidgin and other common software using libotr. This also applies to unauthorized contacts in most default configurations.

### Workarounds

No workaround is currently available.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them  but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Status: public
CVE: CVE-2016-2851
CVSS Score: 8.1 (High)
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Advisory-URL: https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2016-001-libotr/

Summary and Impact
------------------
A remote attacker may crash or execute arbitrary code in libotr by
sending large OTR messages.
While processing specially crafted messages, attacker controlled data on
the heap is written out of bounds.
No special user interaction or authorization is necessary in default
configurations.

Product Description
-------------------
Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging is a cryptographic protocol used in
well-known instant messaging clients such as Pidgin, ChatSecure, Adium
and others. It is designed to work on top of existing protocols and used
worldwide to provide secure communication in insecure environments.
OTR is regarded as highly secure and according to documents revealed by
Edward Snowden one of the protocols that the NSA is not able to decrypt
via cryptanalysis.
The most commonly used implementation of OTR is "libotr" which is a pure
C code implementation of the OTR protocol.

Analysis
--------
During a manual code review X41 D-Sec GmbH discovered a remotely
exploitable vulnerability in libotr.

By sending large messages, an integer overflow can be triggered which
subsequently leads to a heap overflow on 64 bit architectures.

When a message of type OTRL_MSGSTATE_DATA is received during an
established OTR conversation, this message is passed to function
otrl_proto_accept_data in src/message.c line 1347:

	case OTRL_MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED:
		extrakey = gcry_malloc_secure(OTRL_EXTRAKEY_BYTES);
		err = otrl_proto_accept_data(&plaintext, &tlvs, context,
		                  message, &flags, extrakey);

After base64 decoding the message and reading various values from it,
the length of a payload is read into a variable of type "unsigned int"
in file proto.c line 784:

	read_int(datalen);

It is checked that the message buffer will contain at least a "datalen"
number of bytes using read_int in proto.c line 785:

	require_len(datalen);

The macros "read_int" and "required_len" are defined in src/serial.h:

	#define require_len(l) do { \
		if (lenp < (l)) goto invval; \
	    } while(0)

	#define read_int(x) do { \
		require_len(4); \
		(x) = (((unsigned int)bufp[0]) << 24) | (bufp[1] << 16) | (bufp[2] <<
8) | bufp[3]; \
		bufp += 4; lenp -= 4; \
	    } while(0)

4 bytes are read from the message buffer and interpreted as unsigned int
value.

Subsequently a buffer of size datalen+1 is allocated using malloc
in proto.c line 786:

    data = malloc(datalen+1);
    if (!data) {
        err = gcry_error(GPG_ERR_ENOMEM);
        goto err;
    }

Now data from the message is copied into this buffer using memmove in
line 791:

    memmove(data, bufp, datalen);

The vulnerability is triggered if a value of 0xFFFFFFFF (MAX_UINT) is
read from the message buffer. As datalen is of size 32-bit (unsigned
int) the operation "datalen+1" will wrap around before being passed to
malloc.
This will effectively result in a zero allocation ( malloc(0) ) which is
valid in common implementations of malloc on the x86_64 architecture.
As no addition is done in the value passed to the call to memmove, 4
gigabytes of data are copied out of bounds to the heap location pointed
to by data.

Proof of Concept
----------------
In order to successfully trigger the vulnerability, an attacker must be
able to send a data message of more than 5.5 gigabytes to a victim in
order to pass the check "require_len(datalen)".
Due to the support of fragmented OTR messages assembled by libotr this
is possible in practice. By sending 275 messages of size 20MB each, X41
was able to make libotr process such a data message successfully on a
system with 8GB of ram and 15GB of swap space.
As data types for lenp and other lengths of the message are 64 bit large
size_t types on x86_64 architectures huge messages of multiple gigabytes
are possible.
Sending such a message to a pidgin client took only a few minutes on a
fast network connection without visible signs of any attack to a user.

A proof of concept triggering a heap overwrite and crash in the
pidgin-otr plugin for the popular pidgin messenger on x86_64 Linux
architectures is available[1].

The crash occurs due to the overwrite hitting unmapped memory. Using
techniques such as heap grooming, X41 was able to inflate the heap to
more than 4GB and overwrite function pointers and arguments on the heap
in order to take over control flow. A working exploit will not be
published at this time.

Interaction by users beyond having enabled OTR is not necessary as OTR
sessions are automatically established with anyone by default in Pidgin
and other common software using libotr. This also applies to
unauthorized contacts in most default configurations.

Workarounds
-----------
As a temporary workaround on Linux and BSD systems, the amount of memory
available to the process running libotr may be limited to less than 4GB
via ulimit.

### PoC libotr heap overwrite on Pidgin
### 2016-02-17 Markus Vervier
### X41 D-Sec GmbH

### initial code taken from pyxmpp examples (echobot.py)

### PoC was tested using a standard Prosody XMPP-Server on Arch-Linux allowing 20MB sized messages by default (and even larger)

### On a loopback interface the exploit took several minutes,
### using XMPP stream compression this could be reduced massively

### pyxmpp does not support it
### We used XMPP connections without TLS to not further complicate the setup

### USAGE
###
### Prerequisite: 2 Jabber Accounts (attacker, victim), set Ressource of attacker to "attacktest"

### 1. Initiate an encrypted session from attacker-account to victim-account (e.g. using pidgin)
### 2. Disconnect the attacker account
### 3. Fire up this script and let it connect with the attacker account credentials
### 4. Send a message from victim to attacker
### 5. Wait until message sending is complete, pidgin should crash

### !!! Steps 2-5 (and especially user interaction) are only necessary for this PoC
### !!! If we would implement full OTR in this script we could send the bad message directly
### !!! For easier PoC we now wait until an encrypted message is received to get the correct instance tags

##### About The Exploit Database

칑

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as Google Hacking was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny뗩 talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term Googledork to refer
to 라 foolish or inept person as revealed by Google. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a Google problem but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term 띿ork became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and 띿orks were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2016-001

Memory Corruption Vulnerability in "libotr"
===========================================

Overview
--------
Severity Rating: high
Confirmed Affected Version: 4.1.0 and below
Confirmed Patched Version: libotr 4.1.1
Vendor: OTR Development Team
Vendor URL: <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca>
Vendor Reference: OTR Security Advisory 2016-01
Vector: Remote
Credit: X41 D-Sec GmbH, Markus Vervier
Status: public
CVE: CVE-2016-2851
CVSS Score: 8.1 (High)
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Advisory-URL: <https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2016-001-libotr/>

Summary and Impact
------------------
A remote attacker may crash or execute arbitrary code in libotr by
sending large OTR messages.
While processing specially crafted messages, attacker controlled data on
the heap is written out of bounds.
No special user interaction or authorization is necessary in default
configurations.

Product Description
-------------------
Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging is a cryptographic protocol used in
well-known instant messaging clients such as Pidgin, ChatSecure, Adium
and others. It is designed to work on top of existing protocols and used
worldwide to provide secure communication in insecure environments.
OTR is regarded as highly secure and according to documents revealed by
Edward Snowden one of the protocols that the NSA is not able to decrypt
via cryptanalysis.
The most commonly used implementation of OTR is "libotr" which is a pure
C code implementation of the OTR protocol.

Analysis
--------
During a manual code review X41 D-Sec GmbH discovered a remotely
exploitable vulnerability in libotr.

By sending large messages, an integer overflow can be triggered which
subsequently leads to a heap overflow on 64 bit architectures.

When a message of type OTRL_MSGSTATE_DATA is received during an
established OTR conversation, this message is passed to function
otrl_proto_accept_data in src/message.c line 1347:

        case OTRL_MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED:
                extrakey = gcry_malloc_secure(OTRL_EXTRAKEY_BYTES);
                err = otrl_proto_accept_data(&plaintext, &tlvs, context,
                                  message, &flags, extrakey);

After base64 decoding the message and reading various values from it,
the length of a payload is read into a variable of type "unsigned int"
in file proto.c line 784:

        read_int(datalen);

It is checked that the message buffer will contain at least a "datalen"
number of bytes using read_int in proto.c line 785:

        require_len(datalen);

The macros "read_int" and "required_len" are defined in src/serial.h:

        #define require_len(l) do { \
                if (lenp < (l)) goto invval; \
            } while(0)

        #define read_int(x) do { \
                require_len(4); \
                (x) = (((unsigned int)bufp[0]) << 24) | (bufp[1] << 16) | (bufp[2] <<
8) | bufp[3]; \
                bufp += 4; lenp -= 4; \
            } while(0)

4 bytes are read from the message buffer and interpreted as unsigned int
value.

Subsequently a buffer of size datalen+1 is allocated using malloc
in proto.c line 786:

    data = malloc(datalen+1);
    if (!data) {
        err = gcry_error(GPG_ERR_ENOMEM);
        goto err;
    }

Now data from the message is copied into this buffer using memmove in
line 791:

    memmove(data, bufp, datalen);

The vulnerability is triggered if a value of 0xFFFFFFFF (MAX_UINT) is
read from the message buffer. As datalen is of size 32-bit (unsigned
int) the operation "datalen+1" will wrap around before being passed to
malloc.
This will effectively result in a zero allocation ( malloc(0) ) which is
valid in common implementations of malloc on the x86_64 architecture.
As no addition is done in the value passed to the call to memmove, 4
gigabytes of data are copied out of bounds to the heap location pointed
to by data.

Proof of Concept
----------------
In order to successfully trigger the vulnerability, an attacker must be
able to send a data message of more than 5.5 gigabytes to a victim in
order to pass the check "require_len(datalen)".
Due to the support of fragmented OTR messages assembled by libotr this
is possible in practice. By sending 275 messages of size 20MB each, X41
was able to make libotr process such a data message successfully on a
system with 8GB of ram and 15GB of swap space.
As data types for lenp and other lengths of the message are 64 bit large
size_t types on x86_64 architectures huge messages of multiple gigabytes
are possible.
Sending such a message to a pidgin client took only a few minutes on a
fast network connection without visible signs of any attack to a user.

A proof of concept triggering a heap overwrite and crash in the
pidgin-otr plugin for the popular pidgin messenger on x86_64 Linux
architectures is available[1].

The crash occurs due to the overwrite hitting unmapped memory. Using
techniques such as heap grooming, X41 was able to inflate the heap to
more than 4GB and overwrite function pointers and arguments on the heap
in order to take over control flow. A working exploit will not be
published at this time.

Interaction by users beyond having enabled OTR is not necessary as OTR
sessions are automatically established with anyone by default in Pidgin
and other common software using libotr. This also applies to
unauthorized contacts in most default configurations.

Workarounds
-----------
As a temporary workaround on Linux and BSD systems, the amount of memory
available to the process running libotr may be limited to less than 4GB
via ulimit.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=969785#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-03-06 20:30:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 667926](attachment.cgi?id=667926&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=667926&action=edit) 2015-01-intoverflow.patch  EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-03-09 18:00 UTC   [This advisory is under embargo.  I would like to lift the embargo on Wed Mar 9, at 1:00 pm EST = 18h00 UTC.  Do speak up quickly if that's not enought time for you.  The new versions are live at the URLs below, though not yet linked to from anywhere.  The git repository does *not* contain the fix at this time.  I am also attaching the patch to prevent it from being email-munged.]    Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) Security Advisory 2016-01  Integer overflow vulnerability in libotr  Versions 4.1.0 and earlier of libotr in 64-bit builds contain an integer overflow security flaw.  This flaw could potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow and subsequently for arbitrary code to be executed on the user's machine.  In several places in proto.c, the sizes of portions of incoming messages were stored in variables of type int or unsigned int instead of size_t. If a message arrives with very large sizes (for example unsigned int datalen = UINT_MAX), then constructions like malloc(datalen+1) will turn into malloc(0), which on some architectures returns a non-NULL pointer, but UINT_MAX bytes will get written to that pointer.  The reporter has requested a CVE for this issue, but it has not yet been assigned.  The recommended course of action is to upgrade libotr to version 4.1.1 immediately.  The new version can be obtained here:  Source code:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/libotr-4.1.1.tar.gz> gpg signature:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/libotr-4.1.1.tar.gz.asc>  git repository:     git://git.otr.im/libotr.git (tag 4.1.1)  A new Windows binary of pidgin-otr (4.0.2) linked to libotr 4.1.1 is available; however, as the Windows version is a 32-bit build, it is not susceptible to the above flaw.  Windows users may wish to upgrade in any event in order to take advantages of other fixes in libotr 4.1.1 and pidgin-otr 4.0.2, however (see the respective NEWS files).  pidgin-otr 4.0.2 Source code:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/pidgin-otr-4.0.2.tar.gz> gpg signature:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/pidgin-otr-4.0.2.tar.gz.asc>  Windows installer:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/binaries/windows/pidgin-otr-4.0.2.exe> gpg signature:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/binaries/windows/pidgin-otr-4.0.2.exe.asc>  Windows zip file:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/binaries/windows/pidgin-otr-4.0.2.zip> gpg signature:     <https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/binaries/windows/pidgin-otr-4.0.2.zip.asc>   Linux and *BSD vendors and package maintainers have been notified, and updated packages should be available from them.
