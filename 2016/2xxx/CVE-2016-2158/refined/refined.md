Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insufficient access control check within Moodle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** Guests were able to access course category details even when a "force login" setting was enabled. This indicates that authentication was not properly enforced for accessing this specific information.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed for the enumeration of course category details without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated user could access and enumerate details about course categories. This could potentially leak information about course structure or content.
- **Low Severity:** The vulnerability is considered minor, suggesting that while it allows for information disclosure, it likely doesn't grant unauthorized access to critical functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone, as no login or prior authentication was required.
- **Direct Access:** The specific URL endpoint or method that reveals the category details could be directly accessed without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges:** An attacker would not require any user account or special privileges to exploit the issue.
- **Network Access:** Attackers need only standard network access to the Moodle instance.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 3.0 to 3.0.2, 2.9 to 2.9.4, 2.8 to 2.8.10, 2.7 to 2.7.12 and earlier unsupported versions are affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in versions 3.0.3, 2.9.5, 2.8.11, and 2.7.13.
- **Reported By:** The vulnerability was reported by Krista Koivisto.
- **Issue Number:** The internal Moodle issue number is MDL-52774.
- **Commit:** The fix for this issue is linked to commit <http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-52774>

In essence, the vulnerability allowed for information disclosure by bypassing the intended access control mechanisms, specifically for course category details.
