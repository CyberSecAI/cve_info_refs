Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2221:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of URLs used in HTTP redirects. Specifically, the `wp_sanitize_redirect` and `wp_validate_redirect` functions in WordPress did not properly handle URLs with malformed or missing components, or unsupported schemes, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open Redirection:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, meaning an attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to an arbitrary website controlled by the attacker. This can be used for phishing attacks or other malicious purposes.
- **Insufficient URL Validation:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate parsing and validation of URLs, specifically when redirecting users after login.
- **Improper Handling of URL Components:** The code did not properly handle cases where URL components like 'scheme,' 'user,' 'pass', 'host', or 'port' were set or were malformed. Specifically, the code did not enforce that if a scheme, user, pass or port were set, that the host component was also set. Additionally, the code did not prevent colons, forward slashes, question marks, number signs, and at symbols from being used in the user, pass, or host components of the URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to fake login pages or other malicious websites, stealing their credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to websites that distribute malware.
- **Loss of User Trust:** If users are frequently redirected to unexpected or malicious websites, it damages trust in the vulnerable website.
- **SEO Poisoning:** Attackers could potentially manipulate search engine optimization by redirecting users to attacker controlled content, affecting search rankings

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** Attackers create crafted URLs with manipulated redirect parameters.
- **User Interaction:** Users need to click on the malicious URL, often disguised as a legitimate link.
- **Redirect Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered through manipulation of the URL parameters that are used for redirection in the WordPress application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers may need to use social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking the malicious URLs.
- **No privileged access is needed.** The attack can be carried out by anyone who can construct and disseminate a URL.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves enhanced URL validation and sanitization in the `wp_validate_redirect` and `wp_sanitize_redirect` functions.
- The patch includes checks to ensure that if certain components are present in a URL, the host component is also set, and that no restricted characters are present in the user, pass, or host components of the URL.
- The fix includes added test cases for the sanitization and validation functions.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-3472-1) also mentions this CVE along with CVE-2016-2222.
- WordPress version 4.4.2 addresses this issue.
