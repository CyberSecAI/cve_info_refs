ICS Advisory
# Moxa ioLogik E2200 Series Weak Authentication Practices

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-063-01

## OVERVIEW

This advisory is a follow-up to the alert titled ICS-ALERT-15-224-04 Moxa ioLogik E2210 VulnerabilitiesICS-ALERT-15-224-04 Moxa ioLogik E2210 Vulnerabilities, https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-15-224-04, web site last accessed March 03, 2016. that was published August 12, 2015, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site.

Independent researcher Aditya Sood reported weak authentication vulnerabilities in Moxa ioLogik E2200 Ethernet Micro RTU controllers. Moxa has produced a network security enhancement to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Moxa reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of ioLogik:

* ioLogik E2200 series, versions prior to 3.12, and
* ioAdmin Configuration Utility, versions prior to 3.18

## IMPACT

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to the device to change settings and data on the target device.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Moxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil.

The affected product, ioLogik E2200 series, is a micro RTU controller for use in monitoring and control. According to Moxa, ioLogik is deployed across several sectors, including Commercial Facilities and Energy. Moxa estimates that these products are used primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALSCWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html, web site last accessed March 03, 2016.

The device transmits or stores authentication credentials that are not sufficiently encrypted.

CVE-2016-2282NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2282, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N, web site last accessed March 03, 2016.

### INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTHCWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html, web site last accessed March 03, 2016.

The device stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

CVE-2016-2283NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2283, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed March 03, 2016.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

Exploits that target these vulnerabilities are publicly available.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

MOXA has created new firmware versions with improved password encryption between the ioAdmin utility and the ioLogik E2200 device to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Moxa recommends installing these network security enhancements, which can be downloaded at the following locations:

<http://www.moxa.com/support/sarch_result.aspx?type=soft&prod_id=15&type_id=4>

<http://www.moxa.com/support/sarch_result.aspx?type=soft&prod_id=15&type_id=5>

Moxa also recommends that customers use a secured router or a VPN tunnel to protect internet communication.

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
