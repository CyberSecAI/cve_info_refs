Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2422:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Wi-Fi certificates are handled. Specifically, the issue arises from the fact that certificates installed for Wi-Fi only could be used for purposes other than Wi-Fi.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper privilege management:**  The system was not properly isolating certificates meant for Wi-Fi from being used in other contexts, therefore leading to potential privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local malicious application can leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code within the context of an elevated system application
*   Attackers could use the exploit to access elevated capabilities not normally available to third-party apps, such as Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local malicious applications could exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
*   The malicious app would need to be able to interact with the certificate management system to abuse the incorrectly handled Wi-Fi certificates.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability ensures that CA certificates installed for Wi-Fi are only used for Wi-Fi purposes.
*   The certificates are stored in the keystore accessible by services running under WIFI_UID.
*   The fix does not retroactively affect certificates already installed.
