{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in the TCP congestion window reduction logic, specifically in the PRR (Proportional Rate Reduction) implementation, can lead to a division-by-zero error. The congestion window (cwnd) can become zero when inflight and sndcnt are both zero. If a subsequent cwnd reduction phase starts, it uses the current cwnd (0) as a divisor, leading to a div-by-zero.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code lacks proper checks to ensure that the cwnd value is not zero before using it in a division operation.",
      "The proportional rate reduction logic does not properly handle cases where inflight and sndcnt can both be zero"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can trigger this bug by sending a crafted sequence of packets to a server, such as reordered ACKs or DSACKs after a connection terminates an ECN-triggered cwnd reduction with zero inflight, or by sending data packets when a connection in fast recovery fails to retransmit."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to communicate with a vulnerable TCP server and have the ability to send packets that can trigger the vulnerable code path.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `tcp_cwnd_reduction` function, specifically in the context of PRR (Proportional Rate Reduction). The fix involves skipping PRR operation when nothing is acked or sacked. Also, a check is added to avoid using invalid `tp->prior_cwnd` values. The vulnerability can only be triggered with a sequence of less common events, such as a connection terminating an ECN-triggered cwnd reduction, followed by reordered ACKs/DSACKs, or during a fast recovery stage."
