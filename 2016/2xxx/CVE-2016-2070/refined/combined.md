Subject: Linux potential division by zero in TCP code

While looking for something else entirely, I came across this commit,
initially reported at <<https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/12/21/435>>:

commit 8b8a321ff72c785ed5e8b4cf6eda20b35d427390
Author: Yuchung Cheng <ycheng@...gle.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 6 12:42:38 2016 -0800

    tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp_cwnd_reduction

    Patch 3759824da87b ("tcp: PRR uses CRB mode by default and SS mode
    conditionally") introduced a bug that cwnd may become 0 when both
    inflight and sndcnt are 0 (cwnd = inflight + sndcnt). This may lead
    to a div-by-zero if the connection starts another cwnd reduction
    phase by setting tp->prior_cwnd to the current cwnd (0) in
    tcp_init_cwnd_reduction().

    To prevent this we skip PRR operation when nothing is acked or
    sacked. Then cwnd must be positive in all cases as long as ssthresh
    is positive:

    1) The proportional reduction mode
       inflight > ssthresh > 0

    2) The reduction bound mode
      a) inflight == ssthresh > 0

      b) inflight < ssthresh
         sndcnt > 0 since newly_acked_sacked > 0 and inflight < ssthresh

    Therefore in all cases inflight and sndcnt can not both be 0.
    We check invalid tp->prior_cwnd to avoid potential div0 bugs.

    In reality this bug is triggered only with a sequence of less common
    events.  For example, the connection is terminating an ECN-triggered
    cwnd reduction with an inflight 0, then it receives reordered/old
    ACKs or DSACKs from prior transmission (which acks nothing). Or the
    connection is in fast recovery stage that marks everything lost,
    but fails to retransmit due to local issues, then receives data
    packets from other end which acks nothing.

I haven't analyzed this, but it looks potentially security-relvant
(although the last paragraph above suggests it's not entirely
straightforward to trigger).

Patch [3759824](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3759824da87b30ce7a35b4873b62b0ba38905ef5) ("tcp: PRR uses CRB mode by default and SS mode
conditionally") introduced a bug that cwnd may become 0 when both
inflight and sndcnt are 0 (cwnd = inflight + sndcnt). This may lead
to a div-by-zero if the connection starts another cwnd reduction
phase by setting tp->prior_cwnd to the current cwnd (0) in
tcp_init_cwnd_reduction().

To prevent this we skip PRR operation when nothing is acked or
sacked. Then cwnd must be positive in all cases as long as ssthresh
is positive:

1) The proportional reduction mode
   inflight > ssthresh > 0

2) The reduction bound mode
  a) inflight == ssthresh > 0

  b) inflight < ssthresh
     sndcnt > 0 since newly_acked_sacked > 0 and inflight < ssthresh

Therefore in all cases inflight and sndcnt can not both be 0.
We check invalid tp->prior_cwnd to avoid potential div0 bugs.

In reality this bug is triggered only with a sequence of less common
events.  For example, the connection is terminating an ECN-triggered
cwnd reduction with an inflight 0, then it receives reordered/old
ACKs or DSACKs from prior transmission (which acks nothing). Or the
connection is in fast recovery stage that marks everything lost,
but fails to retransmit due to local issues, then receives data
packets from other end which acks nothing.

recordmcount: Fix endianness handling bug for nop\_mcount
commit c84da8b9ad3761eef43811181c7e896e9834b26b upstream.
In nop\_mcount, shdr->sh\_offset and welp->r\_offset should handle
endianness properly, otherwise it will trigger Segmentation fault
if the recordmcount main and file.o have different endianness.

arm64: kernel: fix architected PMU registers unconditional access
commit f436b2ac90a095746beb6729b8ee8ed87c9eaede upstream.
The Performance Monitors extension is an optional feature of the
AArch64 architecture, therefore, in order to access Performance
Monitors registers safely, the kernel should detect the architected
PMU unit presence through the ID\_AA64DFR0\_EL1 register PMUVer field
before accessing them.
This patch implements a guard by reading the ID\_AA64DFR0\_EL1 register
PMUVer field to detect the architected PMU presence and prevent accessing
PMU system registers if the Performance Monitors extension is not
implemented in the core.

arm64: KVM: Add workaround for Cortex-A57 erratum 834220
commit 498cd5c32be6e32bc0f8efcad48ab094bb2bfdf3 upstream.
Cortex-A57 parts up to r1p2 can misreport Stage 2 translation faults
when a Stage 1 permission fault or device alignment fault should
have been reported.
This patch implements the workaround (which is to validate that the
Stage-1 translation actually succeeds) by using code patching.

commit 92e788b749862ebe9920360513a718e5dd4da7a9 upstream.
As previously reported, some userspace applications depend on bogomips

aarch64 than arm, it does break libvirt.
This patch reverts commit 326b16db9f69 ("arm64: delay: don't bother

direct-io: Fix negative return from dio read beyond eof
commit 74cedf9b6c603f2278a05bc91b140b32b434d0b5 upstream.
Assume a filesystem with 4KB blocks. When a file has size 1000 bytes and
we issue direct IO read at offset 1024, blockdev\_direct\_IO() reads the
tail of the last block and the logic for handling short DIO reads in
dio\_complete() results in a return value -24 (1000 - 1024) which
obviously confuses userspace.
Fix the problem by bailing out early once we sample i\_size and can
reliably check that direct IO read starts beyond i\_size.

HID: wacom: Expect 'touch\_max' touches if HID\_DG\_CONTACTCOUNT not present
commit df7079380554e6e8e13a0812c7e6c72f669aba5c upstream.
When introduced in commit 1b5d514, the check 'if (hid\_data->cc\_index >= 0)'
in 'wacom\_wac\_finger\_pre\_report' was intended to switch where the driver
got the expected number of contacts from: HID\_DG\_CONTACTCOUNT if the usage
was present, or 'touch\_max' otherwise. Unfortunately, an oversight worthy
of a brown paper bag (specifically, that 'cc\_index' could never be negative)
meant that the latter 'else' clause would never be entered.
The patch prior to this one introduced a way for 'cc\_index' to be negative,
but only if HID\_DG\_CONTACTCOUNT is present in some report \_other\_ than the
one being processed. To ensure the 'else' clause is also entered for devices
which don't have HID\_DG\_CONTACTCOUNT on \_any\_ report, we add the additional
constraint that 'cc\_report' be non-zero (which is true only if the usage is
present in some report).

HID: wacom: Tie cached HID\_DG\_CONTACTCOUNT indices to report ID
commit 499522c8c015de995aabce3d0f0bf4b9b17f44c3 upstream.
The cached indicies 'cc\_index' and 'cc\_value\_index' introduced in 1b5d514
are only valid for a single report ID. If a touchscreen has multiple
reports with a HID\_DG\_CONTACTCOUNT usage, its possible that the values
will not be correct for the report we're handling, resulting in an
incorrect value for 'num\_expected'. This has been observed with the Cintiq
Companion 2.
To address this, we store the ID of the report those indicies are valid
for in a new 'cc\_report' variable. Before using them to get the expected
contact count, we first check if the ID of the report we're processing
matches 'cc\_report'. If it doesn't, we update the indicies to point to
the HID\_DG\_CONTACTCOUNT usage of the current report (if it has one).

The cause of the crash is not exhaustion of the IOMMU space, there is
plenty of free pages. The function sba\_alloc\_range is called with size
0x11000, thus the pages\_needed variable is 0x11. The function
sba\_search\_bitmap is called with bits\_wanted 0x11 and boundary size is
0x10 (because dma\_get\_seg\_boundary(dev) returns 0xffff).
The function sba\_search\_bitmap attempts to allocate 17 pages that must not
cross 16-page boundary - it can't satisfy this requirement
(iommu\_is\_span\_boundary always returns true) and fails even if there are
many free entries in the IOMMU space.
How did it happen that we try to allocate 17 pages that don't cross
16-page boundary? The cause is in the function iommu\_coalesce\_chunks. This
function tries to coalesce adjacent entries in the scatterlist. The
function does several checks if it may coalesce one entry with the next,
one of those checks is this:
if (startsg->length + dma\_len > max\_seg\_size)
break;
When it finishes coalescing adjacent entries, it allocates the mapping:
sg\_dma\_len(contig\_sg) = dma\_len;
dma\_len = ALIGN(dma\_len + dma\_offset, IOVP\_SIZE);
sg\_dma\_address(contig\_sg) =
PIDE\_FLAG
| (iommu\_alloc\_range(ioc, dev, dma\_len) << IOVP\_SHIFT)
| dma\_offset;
It is possible that (startsg->length + dma\_len > max\_seg\_size) is false
(we are just near the 0x10000 max\_seg\_size boundary), so the funcion
decides to coalesce this entry with the next entry. When the coalescing
succeeds, the function performs
dma\_len = ALIGN(dma\_len + dma\_offset, IOVP\_SIZE);
And now, because of non-zero dma\_offset, dma\_len is greater than 0x10000.
iommu\_alloc\_range (a pointer to sba\_alloc\_range) is called and it attempts
to allocate 17 pages for a device that must not cross 16-page boundary.
To fix the bug, we must make sure that dma\_len after addition of
dma\_offset and alignment doesn't cross the segment boundary. I.e. change
if (startsg->length + dma\_len > max\_seg\_size)
break;
to
if (ALIGN(dma\_len + dma\_offset + startsg->length, IOVP\_SIZE) > max\_seg\_size)
break;
This patch makes this change (it precalculates max\_seg\_boundary at the
beginning of the function iommu\_coalesce\_chunks). I also added a check
that the mapping length doesn't exceed dma\_get\_seg\_boundary(dev) (it is
not needed for Promise TX2+ SATA, but it may be needed for other devices
that have dma\_get\_seg\_boundary lower than dma\_get\_max\_seg\_size).

iommu/vt-d: Fix ATSR handling for Root-Complex integrated endpoints
commit d14053b3c714178525f22660e6aaf41263d00056 upstream.
The VT-d specification says that "Software must enable ATS on endpoint
devices behind a Root Port only if the Root Port is reported as
supporting ATS transactions."
We walk up the tree to find a Root Port, but for integrated devices we
don't find one — we get to the host bridge. In that case we \*should\*
allow ATS. Currently we don't, which means that we are incorrectly
failing to use ATS for the integrated graphics. Fix that.
We should never break out of this loop "naturally" with bus==NULL,
since we'll always find bridge==NULL in that case (and now return 1).
So remove the check for (!bridge) after the loop, since it can never
happen. If it did, it would be worthy of a BUG\_ON(!bridge). But since
it'll oops anyway in that case, that'll do just as well.

arm64: kernel: enforce pmuserenr\_el0 initialization and restore
commit 60792ad349f3c6dc5735aafefe5dc9121c79e320 upstream.
The pmuserenr\_el0 register value is architecturally UNKNOWN on reset.
Current kernel code resets that register value iff the core pmu device is
correctly probed in the kernel. On platforms with missing DT pmu nodes (or
disabled perf events in the kernel), the pmu is not probed, therefore the
pmuserenr\_el0 register is not reset in the kernel, which means that its
value retains the reset value that is architecturally UNKNOWN (system
may run with eg pmuserenr\_el0 == 0x1, which means that PMU counters access
is available at EL0, which must be disallowed).
This patch adds code that resets pmuserenr\_el0 on cold boot and restores
it on core resume from shutdown, so that the pmuserenr\_el0 setup is
always enforced in the kernel.

Commit e6fab5442345 ("ARM/arm64: KVM: test properly for a PTE's
uncachedness") modified the logic to test whether a HYP or stage-2
mapping needs flushing, from [incorrectly] interpreting the page table
attributes to [incorrectly] checking whether the PFN that backs the
mapping is covered by host system RAM. The PFN number is part of the
output of the translation, not the input, so we have to use pte\_pfn()
on the contents of the PTE, not \_\_phys\_to\_pfn() on the HYP virtual
address or stage-2 intermediate physical address.

arm64: fix building without CONFIG\_UID16
commit fbc416ff86183e2203cdf975e2881d7c164b0271 upstream.
As reported by Michal Simek, building an ARM64 kernel with CONFIG\_UID16
disabled currently fails because the system call table still needs to
reference the individual function entry points that are provided by
kernel/sys\_ni.c in this case, and the declarations are hidden inside
of #ifdef CONFIG\_UID16:
arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h:57:8: error: 'sys\_lchown16' undeclared here (not in a function)
\_\_SYSCALL(\_\_NR\_lchown, sys\_lchown16)
I believe this problem only exists on ARM64, because older architectures
tend to not need declarations when their system call table is built
in assembly code, while newer architectures tend to not need UID16
support. ARM64 only uses these system calls for compatibility with
32-bit ARM binaries.
This changes the CONFIG\_UID16 check into CONFIG\_HAVE\_UID16, which is
set unconditionally on ARM64 with CONFIG\_COMPAT, so we see the
declarations whenever we need them, but otherwise the behavior is
unchanged.

HW exposes the register number in the ESR\_EL2 register. It was so
far understood that SW had to distinguish between AArch32 and AArch64
accesses (based on the current AArch32 mode and register number).
It turns out that I misinterpreted the ARM ARM, and the clue is in
D1.20.1: "For some exceptions, the exception syndrome given in the
ESR\_ELx identifies one or more register numbers from the issued
instruction that generated the exception. Where the exception is
taken from an Exception level using AArch32 these register numbers
give the AArch64 view of the register."
Which means that the HW is already giving us the translated version,
and that we shouldn't try to interpret it at all (for example, doing
an MMIO operation from the IRQ mode using the LR register leads to
very unexpected behaviours).
The fix is thus not to perform a call to vcpu\_reg32() at all from
vcpu\_reg(), and use whatever register number is supplied directly.
The only case we need to find out about the mapping is when we
actively generate a register access, which only occurs when injecting
a fault in a guest.

ARM/arm64: KVM: test properly for a PTE's uncachedness
commit e6fab54423450d699a09ec2b899473a541f61971 upstream.
The open coded tests for checking whether a PTE maps a page as
uncached use a flawed '(pte\_val(xxx) & CONST) != CONST' pattern,
which is not guaranteed to work since the type of a mapping is
not a set of mutually exclusive bits
For HYP mappings, the type is an index into the MAIR table (i.e, the
index itself does not contain any information whatsoever about the
type of the mapping), and for stage-2 mappings it is a bit field where
normal memory and device types are defined as follows:
#define MT\_S2\_NORMAL 0xf
#define MT\_S2\_DEVICE\_nGnRE 0x1
I.e., masking \*and\* comparing with the latter matches on the former,
and we have been getting lucky merely because the S2 device mappings
also have the PTE\_UXN bit set, or we would misidentify memory mappings
as device mappings.
Since the unmap\_range() code path (which contains one instance of the
flawed test) is used both for HYP mappings and stage-2 mappings, and
considering the difference between the two, it is non-trivial to fix
this by rewriting the tests in place, as it would involve passing
down the type of mapping through all the functions.
However, since HYP mappings and stage-2 mappings both deal with host
physical addresses, we can simply check whether the mapping is backed
by memory that is managed by the host kernel, and only perform the
D-cache maintenance if this is the case.

arm64: kernel: pause/unpause function graph tracer in cpu\_suspend()
commit de818bd4522c40ea02a81b387d2fa86f989c9623 upstream.
The function graph tracer adds instrumentation that is required to trace
both entry and exit of a function. In particular the function graph
tracer updates the "return address" of a function in order to insert
a trace callback on function exit.
Kernel power management functions like cpu\_suspend() are called
upon power down entry with functions called "finishers" that are in turn
called to trigger the power down sequence but they may not return to the
kernel through the normal return path.
When the core resumes from low-power it returns to the cpu\_suspend()
function through the cpu\_resume path, which leaves the trace stack frame
set-up by the function tracer in an incosistent state upon return to the
kernel when tracing is enabled.
This patch fixes the issue by pausing/resuming the function graph
tracer on the thread executing cpu\_suspend() (ie the function call that
subsequently triggers the "suspend finishers"), so that the function graph
tracer state is kept consistent across functions that enter power down
states and never return by effectively disabling graph tracer while they
are executing.

arm64: cmpxchg\_dbl: fix return value type
commit 57a65667991aaddef730b0c910111ab76a1ff245 upstream.
The current arm64 \_\_cmpxchg\_double{\_mb} implementations carry out the
compare exchange by first comparing the old values passed in to the
values read from the pointer provided and by stashing the cumulative
bitwise difference in a 64-bit register.
By comparing the register content against 0, it is possible to detect if
the values read differ from the old values passed in, so that the compare
exchange detects whether it has to bail out or carry on completing the
operation with the exchange.
Given the current implementation, to detect the cmpxchg operation
status, the \_\_cmpxchg\_double{\_mb} functions should return the 64-bit
stashed bitwise difference so that the caller can detect cmpxchg failure
by comparing the return value content against 0. The current implementation
declares the return value as an int, which means that the 64-bit
value stashing the bitwise difference is truncated before being
returned to the \_\_cmpxchg\_double{\_mb} callers, which means that
any bitwise difference present in the top 32 bits goes undetected,
triggering false positives and subsequent kernel failures.
This patch fixes the issue by declaring the arm64 \_\_cmpxchg\_double{\_mb}
return values as a long, so that the bitwise difference is
properly propagated on failure, restoring the expected behaviour.

For the function that not in these sections, the call mcount

it will bring performance overhead, such as do\_mem\_abort (in
.exception.text section). This patch make the call mcount to
nop for this case in recordmcount.

powerpc/module: Handle R\_PPC64\_ENTRY relocations
commit a61674bdfc7c2bf909c4010699607b62b69b7bec upstream.
GCC 6 will include changes to generated code with -mcmodel=large,
which is used to build kernel modules on powerpc64le. This was
necessary because the large model is supposed to allow arbitrary
sizes and locations of the code and data sections, but the ELFv2
global entry point prolog still made the unconditional assumption
that the TOC associated with any particular function can be found
within 2 GB of the function entry point:
func:
addis r2,r12,(.TOC.-func)@ha
addi r2,r2,(.TOC.-func)@l
.localentry func, .-func
To remove this assumption, GCC will now generate instead this global
entry point prolog sequence when using -mcmodel=large:
.quad .TOC.-func
func:
.reloc ., R\_PPC64\_ENTRY
ld r2, -8(r12)
add r2, r2, r12
.localentry func, .-func
The new .reloc triggers an optimization in the linker that will
replace this new prolog with the original code (see above) if the
linker determines that the distance between .TOC. and func is in
range after all.
Since this new relocation is now present in module object files,
the kernel module loader is required to handle them too. This
patch adds support for the new relocation and implements the
same optimization done by the GNU linker.

scripts/recordmcount.pl: support data in text section on powerpc
commit 2e50c4bef77511b42cc226865d6bc568fa7f8769 upstream.
If a text section starts out with a data blob before the first
function start label, disassembly parsing doing in recordmcount.pl
gets confused on powerpc, leading to creation of corrupted module
objects.
This was not a problem so far since the compiler would never create
such text sections. However, this has changed with a recent change
in GCC 6 to support distances of > 2GB between a function and its
assoicated TOC in the ELFv2 ABI, exposing this problem.
There is already code in recordmcount.pl to handle such data blobs
on the sparc64 platform. This patch uses the same method to handle
those on powerpc as well.

powerpc: Make value-returning atomics fully ordered
commit 49e9cf3f0c04bf76ffa59242254110309554861d upstream.
According to memory-barriers.txt:
> Any atomic operation that modifies some state in memory and returns
> information about the state (old or new) implies an SMP-conditional
> general memory barrier (smp\_mb()) on each side of the actual
> operation ...
Which mean these operations should be fully ordered. However on PPC,
PPC\_ATOMIC\_ENTRY\_BARRIER is the barrier before the actual operation,
which is currently "lwsync" if SMP=y. The leading "lwsync" can not
guarantee fully ordered atomics, according to Paul Mckenney:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/14/970
To fix this, we define PPC\_ATOMIC\_ENTRY\_BARRIER as "sync" to guarantee
the fully-ordered semantics.
This also makes futex atomics fully ordered, which can avoid possible
memory ordering problems if userspace code relies on futex system call
for fully ordered semantics.

This could be a problem for kernels that don't support OPAL\_MSG\_OCC

OCC is throttling the chip. For a kernel that is paying attention to
the message queue, we could get these notifications quite often.
Conceivably, future message types could also come fairly often,
and printing that we didn't understand them 10,000 times provides
no further information than printing them once.

powerpc/opal-irqchip: Fix deadlock introduced by "Fix double endian conversion"
commit 036592fbbe753d236402a0ae68148e7c143a0f0e upstream.
Commit 25642e1459ac ("powerpc/opal-irqchip: Fix double endian
conversion") fixed an endian bug by calling opal\_handle\_events() in
opal\_event\_unmask().
However this introduced a deadlock if we find an event is active
during unmasking and call opal\_handle\_events() again. The bad call
sequence is:
opal\_interrupt()
-> opal\_handle\_events()
-> generic\_handle\_irq()
-> handle\_level\_irq()
-> raw\_spin\_lock(&desc->lock)
handle\_irq\_event(desc)
unmask\_irq(desc)
-> opal\_event\_unmask()
-> opal\_handle\_events()
-> generic\_handle\_irq()
-> handle\_level\_irq()
-> raw\_spin\_lock(&desc->lock) (BOOM)
When generating multiple opal events in quick succession this would lead
to the following stall warnings:

behaviour.

This bug leads to OPAL event delivery being delayed or dropped on some

powerpc/tm: Check for already reclaimed tasks
commit 7f821fc9c77a9b01fe7b1d6e72717b33d8d64142 upstream.
Currently we can hit a scenario where we'll tm\_reclaim() twice. This
results in a TM bad thing exception because the second reclaim occurs
when not in suspend mode.
The scenario in which this can happen is the following. We attempt to
deliver a signal to userspace. To do this we need obtain the stack
pointer to write the signal context. To get this stack pointer we
must tm\_reclaim() in case we need to use the checkpointed stack
pointer (see get\_tm\_stackpointer()). Normally we'd then return
directly to userspace to deliver the signal without going through
\_\_switch\_to().
Unfortunatley, if at this point we get an error (such as a bad
userspace stack pointer), we need to exit the process. The exit will
result in a \_\_switch\_to(). \_\_switch\_to() will attempt to save the
process state which results in another tm\_reclaim(). This
tm\_reclaim() now causes a TM Bad Thing exception as this state has
already been saved and the processor is no longer in TM suspend mode.
Whee!
This patch checks the state of the MSR to ensure we are TM suspended
before we attempt the tm\_reclaim(). If we've already saved the state
away, we should no longer be in TM suspend mode. This has the
additional advantage of checking for a potential TM Bad Thing
exception.

xfrm: dst\_entries\_init() per-net dst\_ops
[ Upstream commit a8a572a6b5f2a79280d6e302cb3c1cb1fbaeb3e8 ]
Remove the dst\_entries\_init/destroy calls for xfrm4 and xfrm6 dst\_ops
templates; their dst\_entries counters will never be used. Move the
xfrm dst\_ops initialization from the common xfrm/xfrm\_policy.c to
xfrm4/xfrm4\_policy.c and xfrm6/xfrm6\_policy.c, and call dst\_entries\_init
and dst\_entries\_destroy for each net namespace.
The ipv4 and ipv6 xfrms each create dst\_ops template, and perform
dst\_entries\_init on the templates. The template values are copied to each
net namespace's xfrm.xfrm\*\_dst\_ops. The problem there is the dst\_ops
pcpuc\_entries field is a percpu counter and cannot be used correctly by
simply copying it to another object.
The result of this is a very subtle bug; changes to the dst entries
counter from one net namespace may sometimes get applied to a different
net namespace dst entries counter. This is because of how the percpu
counter works; it has a main count field as well as a pointer to the
percpu variables. Each net namespace maintains its own main count
variable, but all point to one set of percpu variables. When any net
namespace happens to change one of the percpu variables to outside its
small batch range, its count is moved to the net namespace's main count
variable. So with multiple net namespaces operating concurrently, the
dst\_ops entries counter can stray from the actual value that it should
be; if counts are consistently moved from one net namespace to another
(which my testing showed is likely), then one net namespace winds up
with a negative dst\_ops count while another winds up with a continually
increasing count, eventually reaching its gc\_thresh limit, which causes
all new traffic on the net namespace to fail with -ENOBUFS.

batman-adv: Drop immediate orig\_node free function
[ Upstream commit 42eff6a617e23b691f8e4467f4687ed7245a92db ]
It is not allowed to free the memory of an object which is part of a list
which is protected by rcu-read-side-critical sections without making sure
that no other context is accessing the object anymore. This usually happens
by removing the references to this object and then waiting until the rcu
grace period is over and no one (allowedly) accesses it anymore.
But the \_now functions ignore this completely. They free the object
directly even when a different context still tries to access it. This has
to be avoided and thus these functions must be removed and all functions
have to use batadv\_orig\_node\_free\_ref.

batman-adv: Avoid recursive call\_rcu for batadv\_nc\_node
[ Upstream commit 44e8e7e91d6c7c7ab19688750f7257292640d1a0 ]
The batadv\_nc\_node\_free\_ref function uses call\_rcu to delay the free of the
batadv\_nc\_node object until no (already started) rcu\_read\_lock is enabled
anymore. This makes sure that no context is still trying to access the
object which should be removed. But batadv\_nc\_node also contains a
reference to orig\_node which must be removed.
The reference drop of orig\_node was done in the call\_rcu function
batadv\_nc\_node\_free\_rcu but should actually be done in the
batadv\_nc\_node\_release function to avoid nested call\_rcus. This is
important because rcu\_barrier (e.g. batadv\_softif\_free or batadv\_exit) will
not detect the inner call\_rcu as relevant for its execution. Otherwise this
barrier will most likely be inserted in the queue before the callback of
the first call\_rcu was executed. The caller of rcu\_barrier will therefore
continue to run before the inner call\_rcu callback finished.

bridge: fix lockdep addr\_list\_lock false positive splat
[ Upstream commit c6894dec8ea9ae05747124dce98b3b5c2e69b168 ]
After promisc mode management was introduced a bridge device could do
dev\_set\_promiscuity from its ndo\_change\_rx\_flags() callback which in
turn can be called after the bridge's addr\_list\_lock has been taken
(e.g. by dev\_uc\_add). This causes a false positive lockdep splat because
the port interfaces' addr\_list\_lock is taken when br\_manage\_promisc()
runs after the bridge's addr list lock was already taken.
To remove the false positive introduce a custom bridge addr\_list\_lock
class and set it on bridge init.
A simple way to reproduce this is with the following:
$ brctl addbr br0
$ ip l add l br0 br0.100 type vlan id 100
$ ip l set br0 up
$ ip l set br0.100 up
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/vlan\_filtering
$ brctl addif br0 eth0

Ivaylo Dimitrov reported a regression caused by commit 7866a621043f
("dev: add per net\_device packet type chains").
skb->dev becomes NULL and we crash in \_\_netif\_receive\_skb\_core().
Before above commit, different kind of bugs or corruptions could happen
without major crash.
But the root cause is that phonet\_rcv() can queue skb without checking
if skb is shared or not.

Commit 1f718f0f4f97 ("bonding: populate neighbour's private on enslave")
undoes the fix provided by commit c2edacf80e15 ("bonding / ipv6: no addrconf
for slaves separately from master") by effectively setting the slave flag
after the slave has been opened. If the slave comes up quickly enough, it
will go through the IPv6 addrconf before the slave flag has been set and
will get a link local IPv6 address.
In order to ensure that addrconf knows to ignore the slave devices on state
change, set IFF\_SLAVE before dev\_open() during bonding enslavement.

Commit acf8dd0a9d0b ("udp: only allow UFO for packets from SOCK\_DGRAM

the same also for SOCK\_DGRAM sockets with SO\_NO\_CHECK options, even if
for a bit different reason: while such socket would override the
CHECKSUM\_PARTIAL set by ip\_ufo\_append\_data(), gso\_size is still set and
bad offloading flags warning is triggered in \_\_skb\_gso\_segment().
In the IPv6 case, SO\_NO\_CHECK option is ignored but we need to disallow
UFO for packets sent by sockets with UDP\_NO\_CHECK6\_TX option.

tcp\_yeah: don't set ssthresh below 2
[ Upstream commit 83d15e70c4d8909d722c0d64747d8fb42e38a48f ]
For tcp\_yeah, use an ssthresh floor of 2, the same floor used by Reno
and CUBIC, per RFC 5681 (equation 4).
tcp\_yeah\_ssthresh() was sometimes returning a 0 or negative ssthresh
value if the intended reduction is as big or bigger than the current
cwnd. Congestion control modules should never return a zero or
negative ssthresh. A zero ssthresh generally results in a zero cwnd,
causing the connection to stall. A negative ssthresh value will be
interpreted as a u32 and will set a target cwnd for PRR near 4
billion.
Oleksandr Natalenko reported that a system using tcp\_yeah with ECN
could see a warning about a prior\_cwnd of 0 in
tcp\_cwnd\_reduction(). Testing verified that this was due to
tcp\_yeah\_ssthresh() misbehaving in this way.

vxlan: fix test which detect duplicate vxlan iface
[ Upstream commit 07b9b37c227cb8d88d478b4a9c5634fee514ede1 ]
When a vxlan interface is created, the driver checks that there is not
another vxlan interface with the same properties. To do this, it checks
the existing vxlan udp socket. Since commit 1c51a9159dde, the creation of
the vxlan socket is done only when the interface is set up, thus it breaks
that test.
Example:
$ ip l a vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 group 239.0.0.10 dev eth0 dstport 0
$ ip l a vxlan11 type vxlan id 10 group 239.0.0.10 dev eth0 dstport 0
$ ip -br l | grep vxlan
vxlan10 DOWN f2:55:1c:6a:fb:00
vxlan11 DOWN 7a:cb:b9:38:59:0d
Instead of checking sockets, let's loop over the vxlan iface list.

tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp\_cwnd\_reduction
[ Upstream commit 8b8a321ff72c785ed5e8b4cf6eda20b35d427390 ]
Patch 3759824da87b ("tcp: PRR uses CRB mode by default and SS mode
conditionally") introduced a bug that cwnd may become 0 when both
inflight and sndcnt are 0 (cwnd = inflight + sndcnt). This may lead
to a div-by-zero if the connection starts another cwnd reduction
phase by setting tp->prior\_cwnd to the current cwnd (0) in
tcp\_init\_cwnd\_reduction().
To prevent this we skip PRR operation when nothing is acked or
sacked. Then cwnd must be positive in all cases as long as ssthresh
is positive:
1) The proportional reduction mode
inflight > ssthresh > 0
2) The reduction bound mode
a) inflight == ssthresh > 0
b) inflight < ssthresh
sndcnt > 0 since newly\_acked\_sacked > 0 and inflight < ssthresh
Therefore in all cases inflight and sndcnt can not both be 0.
We check invalid tp->prior\_cwnd to avoid potential div0 bugs.
In reality this bug is triggered only with a sequence of less common
events. For example, the connection is terminating an ECN-triggered
cwnd reduction with an inflight 0, then it receives reordered/old
ACKs or DSACKs from prior transmission (which acks nothing). Or the
connection is in fast recovery stage that marks everything lost,
but fails to retransmit due to local issues, then receives data
packets from other end which acks nothing.

This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs

af\_unix: Fix splice-bind deadlock
[ Upstream commit c845acb324aa85a39650a14e7696982ceea75dc1 ]
On 2015/11/06, Dmitry Vyukov reported a deadlock involving the splice
system call and AF\_UNIX sockets,
http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2015/11/06/24
The situation was analyzed as
(a while ago) A: socketpair()
B: splice() from a pipe to /mnt/regular\_file
does sb\_start\_write() on /mnt
C: try to freeze /mnt
wait for B to finish with /mnt
A: bind() try to bind our socket to /mnt/new\_socket\_name
lock our socket, see it not bound yet
decide that it needs to create something in /mnt
try to do sb\_start\_write() on /mnt, block (it's
waiting for C).
D: splice() from the same pipe to our socket
lock the pipe, see that socket is connected
try to lock the socket, block waiting for A
B: get around to actually feeding a chunk from
pipe to file, try to lock the pipe. Deadlock.
on 2015/11/10 by Al Viro,
http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2015/11/10/4
The patch fixes this by removing the kern\_path\_create related code from
unix\_mknod and executing it as part of unix\_bind prior acquiring the
readlock of the socket in question. This means that A (as used above)
will sb\_start\_write on /mnt before it acquires the readlock, hence, it
won't indirectly block B which first did a sb\_start\_write and then
waited for a thread trying to acquire the readlock. Consequently, A
being blocked by C waiting for B won't cause a deadlock anymore
(effectively, both A and B acquire two locks in opposite order in the
situation described above).
Dmitry Vyukov() tested the original patch.

sctp: sctp should release assoc when sctp\_make\_abort\_user return NULL in sctp\_close
[ Upstream commit 068d8bd338e855286aea54e70d1c101569284b21 ]
In sctp\_close, sctp\_make\_abort\_user may return NULL because of memory
allocation failure. If this happens, it will bypass any state change
and never free the assoc. The assoc has no chance to be freed and it
will be kept in memory with the state it had even after the socket is
closed by sctp\_close().
So if sctp\_make\_abort\_user fails to allocate memory, we should abort
the asoc via sctp\_primitive\_ABORT as well. Just like the annotation in
sctp\_sf\_cookie\_wait\_prm\_abort and sctp\_sf\_do\_9\_1\_prm\_abort said,
"Even if we can't send the ABORT due to low memory delete the TCB.
This is a departure from our typical NOMEM handling".
But then the chunk is NULL (low memory) and the SCTP\_CMD\_REPLY cmd would
dereference the chunk pointer, and system crash. So we should add
SCTP\_CMD\_REPLY cmd only when the chunk is not NULL, just like other
places where it adds SCTP\_CMD\_REPLY cmd.

net: cdc\_ncm: avoid changing RX/TX buffers on MTU changes
[ Upstream commit 1dfddff5fcd869fcab0c52fafae099dfa435a935 ]
NCM buffer sizes are negotiated with the device independently of
the network device MTU. The RX buffers are allocated by the
usbnet framework based on the rx\_urb\_size value set by cdc\_ncm. A
single RX buffer can hold a number of MTU sized packets.
The default usbnet change\_mtu ndo only modifies rx\_urb\_size if it
is equal to hard\_mtu. And the cdc\_ncm driver will set rx\_urb\_size
and hard\_mtu independently of each other, based on dwNtbInMaxSize
and dwNtbOutMaxSize respectively. It was therefore assumed that
usbnet\_change\_mtu() would never touch rx\_urb\_size. This failed to
consider the case where dwNtbInMaxSize and dwNtbOutMaxSize happens
to be equal.
Fix by implementing an NCM specific change\_mtu ndo, modifying the
netdev MTU without touching the buffer size settings.

veth: don’t modify ip\_summed; doing so treats packets with bad checksums as good.
[ Upstream commit ce8c839b74e3017996fad4e1b7ba2e2625ede82f ]
Packets that arrive from real hardware devices have ip\_summed ==
CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY if the hardware verified the checksums, or
CHECKSUM\_NONE if the packet is bad or it was unable to verify it. The
current version of veth will replace CHECKSUM\_NONE with
CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY, which causes corrupt packets routed from hardware to
a veth device to be delivered to the application. This caused applications
at Twitter to receive corrupt data when network hardware was corrupting
packets.
We believe this was added as an optimization to skip computing and
verifying checksums for communication between containers. However, locally
generated packets have ip\_summed == CHECKSUM\_PARTIAL, so the code as
written does nothing for them. As far as we can tell, after removing this
code, these packets are transmitted from one stack to another unmodified
(tcpdump shows invalid checksums on both sides, as expected), and they are
delivered correctly to applications. We didn’t test every possible network
configuration, but we tried a few common ones such as bridging containers,
using NAT between the host and a container, and routing from hardware
devices to containers. We have effectively deployed this in production at
Twitter (by disabling RX checksum offloading on veth devices).
This code dates back to the first version of the driver, commit
 ("[NET]: Virtual ethernet device driver"), so I
suspect this bug occurred mostly because the driver API has evolved
significantly since then. Commit <0b7967503dc97864f283a> ("net/veth: Fix
packet checksumming") (in December 2010) fixed this for packets that get
created locally and sent to hardware devices, by not changing
CHECKSUM\_PARTIAL. However, the same issue still occurs for packets coming
in from hardware devices.

run in a workqueue. However, the commit failed to take a reference to
the usb\_hub structure or to lock the hub interface while doing so. As
a result, if a hub is plugged in and quickly unplugged before the work
routine can run, the routine will try to access memory that has been
deallocated. Or, if the hub is unplugged while the routine is
running, the memory may be deallocated while it is in active use.
This patch fixes the problem by taking a reference to the usb\_hub at
the start of hub\_activate() and releasing it at the end (when the work
is finished), and by locking the hub interface while the work routine
is running. It also adds a check at the start of the routine to see
if the hub has already been disconnected, in which nothing should be
done.

airspy: increase USB control message buffer size
commit aa0850e1d56623845b46350ffd971afa9241886d upstream.
Driver requested device firmware version string during probe using
only 24 byte long buffer. That buffer is too small for newer firmware
versions, which causes device firmware hang - device stops responding
to any commands after that. Increase buffer size to 128 which should
be enough for any current and future version strings.

usb: xhci: fix config fail of FS hub behind a HS hub with MTT
commit 096b110a3dd3c868e4610937c80d2e3f3357c1a9 upstream.
if a full speed hub connects to a high speed hub which
supports MTT, the MTT field of its slot context will be set
to 1 when xHCI driver setups an xHCI virtual device in
xhci\_setup\_addressable\_virt\_dev(); once usb core fetch its
hub descriptor, and need to update the xHC's internal data
structures for the device, the HUB field of its slot context
will be set to 1 too, meanwhile MTT is also set before,
this will cause configure endpoint command fail, so in the
case, we should clear MTT to 0 for full speed hub according
to section 6.2.2

ALSA: timer: Handle disconnection more safely
commit 230323dac060123c340cf75997971145a42661ee upstream.
Currently ALSA timer device doesn't take the disconnection into
account very well; it merely unlinks the timer device at disconnection
callback but does nothing else. Because of this, when an application
accessing the timer device is disconnected, it may release the
resource before actually closed. In most cases, it results in a
warning message indicating a leftover timer instance like:
ALSA: timer xxxx is busy?
But basically this is an open race.
This patch tries to address it. The strategy is like other ALSA
devices: namely,
- Manage card's refcount at each open/close
- Wake up the pending tasks at disconnection
- Check the shutdown flag appropriately at each possible call
Note that this patch has one ugly hack to handle the wakeup of pending
tasks. It'd be cleaner to introduce a new disconnect op to
snd\_timer\_instance ops. But since it would lead to internal ABI
breakage and it eventually increase my own work when backporting to
stable kernels, I took a different path to implement locally in
timer.c. A cleanup patch will follow at next for 4.5 kernel.

For avoiding this race, we just need to flush the pending probe work
explicitly before actually starting the resource release.

ALSA: hrtimer: Fix stall by hrtimer\_cancel()
commit 2ba1fe7a06d3624f9a7586d672b55f08f7c670f3 upstream.
hrtimer\_cancel() waits for the completion from the callback, thus it
must not be called inside the callback itself. This was already a
problem in the past with ALSA hrtimer driver, and the early commit
[fcfdebe70759: ALSA: hrtimer - Fix lock-up] tried to address it.
However, the previous fix is still insufficient: it may still cause a
lockup when the ALSA timer instance reprograms itself in its callback.
Then it invokes the start function even in snd\_timer\_interrupt() that
is called in hrtimer callback itself, results in a CPU stall. This is
no hypothetical problem but actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.
This patch tries to fix the issue again. Now we call
hrtimer\_try\_to\_cancel() at both start and stop functions so that it
won't fall into a deadlock, yet giving some chance to cancel the queue
if the functions have been called outside the callback. The proper
hrtimer\_cancel() is called in anyway at closing, so this should be
enough.

ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling
commit b5a663aa426f4884c71cd8580adae73f33570f0d upstream.
A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
operating the master instance as it lacks of locking. Since the
master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
with it while changing the slave instance, too. Also, some linked
lists (active\_list and ack\_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
accesses.
This patch tries to address these issues. It adds spin lock of
timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
few places. For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
slave\_active\_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.
Also, ack and active\_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
snd\_timer\_stop() and snd\_timer\_close().
Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of \_snd\_timer\_stop()
at removing slave links. This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
readers wrt locking. Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.
Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
this hopefully fixes these issues.

ALSA: hda - Set SKL+ hda controller power at freeze() and thaw()
commit 3e6db33aaf1d42a30339f831ec4850570d6cc7a3 upstream.
It takes three minutes to enter into hibernation on some OEM SKL
machines and we see many codec spurious response after thaw() opertion.
This is because HDA is still in D0 state after freeze() call and
pci\_pm\_freeze/pci\_pm\_freeze\_noirq() don't set D3 hot in pci\_bus driver.
It seems bios still access HDA when system enter into freeze state,
HDA will receive codec response interrupt immediately after thaw() call.
Because of this unexpected interrupt, HDA enter into a abnormal
state and slow down the system enter into hibernation.
In this patch, we put HDA into D3 hot state in azx\_freeze\_noirq() and
put HDA into D0 state in azx\_thaw\_noirq().

ALSA: usb-audio: Add a more accurate volume quirk for AudioQuest DragonFly
commit 42e3121d90f42e57f6dbd6083dff2f57b3ec7daa upstream.
AudioQuest DragonFly DAC reports a volume control range of 0..50
(0x0000..0x0032) which in USB Audio means a range of 0 .. 0.2dB, which
is obviously incorrect and would cause software using the dB information
in e.g. volume sliders to have a massive volume difference in 100..102%
range.
Commit 2d1cb7f658fb ("ALSA: usb-audio: add dB range mapping for some
devices") added a dB range mapping for it with range 0..50 dB.
However, the actual volume mapping seems to be neither linear volume nor
linear dB scale, but instead quite close to the cubic mapping e.g.
alsamixer uses, with a range of approx. -53...0 dB.
Replace the previous quirk with a custom dB mapping based on some basic
output measurements, using a 10-item range TLV (which will still fit in
alsa-lib MAX\_TLV\_RANGE\_SIZE).
Tested on AudioQuest DragonFly HW v1.2. The quirk is only applied if the
range is 0..50, so if this gets fixed/changed in later HW revisions it
will no longer be applied.
v2: incorporated Takashi Iwai's suggestion for the quirk application
method

ALSA: hda - Set codec to D3 at reboot/shutdown on Thinkpads
commit 70a0976b0c0d90f4246d7e63359d796ec82b87d6 upstream.
Lenovo Thinkpads with Realtek codecs may still have some loud
crackling noises at reboot/shutdown even though a few previous fixes
have been applied. It's because the previous fix (disabling the
default shutup callback) takes effect only at transition of the codec
power state. Meanwhile, at reboot or shutdown, we don't take down the
codec power as default, thus it triggers the same problem unless the
codec is powered down casually by runtime PM.
This patch tries to address the issue. It gives two things:
- implement the separate reboot\_notify hook to struct alc\_spec, and
call it optionally if defined.
- turn off the codec to D3 for Thinkpad models via this new callback

another existing alc\_fixup\_disable\_aamix(). It resulted in a good

ALSA: hda - Fix noise problems on Thinkpad T440s
commit 9a811230481243f384b8036c6a558bfdbd961f78 upstream.
Lenovo Thinkpad T440s suffers from constant background noises, and it
seems to be a generic hardware issue on this model:
https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T/T440s-speaker-noise/td-p/1339883
As the noise comes from the analog loopback path, disabling the path
is the easy workaround.
Also, the machine gives significant cracking noises at PM suspend. A
workaround found by trial-and-error is to disable the shutup callback
currently used for ALC269-variant.
This patch addresses these noise issues by introducing a new fixup
chain. Although the same workaround might be applicable to other
Thinkpad models, it's applied only to T440s (17aa:220c) in this patch,
so far, just to be safe (you chicken!). As a compromise, a new model
option string "tp440" is provided now, though, so that owners of other
Thinkpad models can test it more easily.

the models, all of them have this problem.
So far, this problem is only specific to these two thinkpad models,
we did not find this problem on the old thinkpad models with the
codec alc293 or alc292.

commit a74a821624c0c75388a193337babd17a8c02c740 upstream.
rme96 driver needs to reset DAC depending on the sample rate, and this
results in resetting to the max volume suddenly. It's because of the
missing call of snd\_rme96\_apply\_dac\_volume().
However, calling this function right after the DAC reset still may not
work, and we need some delay before this call. Since the DAC reset
and the procedure after that are performed in the spinlock, we delay
the DAC volume restore at the end after the spinlock.

ALSA: hda - Skip ELD notification during system suspend
commit 8ae743e82f0b86f3b860c27fc2c8f574cf959fd0 upstream.
The recent addition of ELD notifier for Intel HDMI/DP codec may lead
the bad codec connection found as kernel messages like below:
Suspending console(s) (use no\_console\_suspend to debug)
hdmi\_present\_sense: snd\_hda\_codec\_hdmi hdaudioC0D2: HDMI status: Codec=2 Pin=6 Presence\_Detect=1 ELD\_Valid=1

azx\_single\_wait\_for\_response: 42 callbacks suppressed
This seems appearing when the sound driver went to suspend before i915
driver. Then i915 driver disables HDMI/DP audio bit and calls the
registered notifier, and the HDA codec tries to handle it as a
hot(un)plug. But since the driver is already in the suspended state,
it fails miserably.
As this is a sort of spurious wakeup, it can be ignored safely, as
long as it's delivered during the system suspend. OTOH, if a
notification comes during the runtime suspend, the situation is
different: we need to wake up. But during the system suspend, such a
notification can't be the reason for a wakeup.
This patch addresses it by a simple check of the current sound card
status. The skipped notification doesn't matter because the HDA
driver will check the plugged status forcibly at the resume in
return.
Then, why the card status, not a runtime PM status or else? The HDA
controller driver is supposed to set the card status to D3 at the
system suspend but not at the runtime suspend. So we can see it as a
flag that is set only for the system suspend. Admittedly, it's a bit
ugly, but it should work well for now.

HP ProBook 6550b needs the same pin fixup applied to other HP B-series
laptops with docks for making its headphone and dock headphone jacks
working properly. We just need to add the codec SSID to the list.

ALSA: hda - Fix lost 4k BDL boundary workaround
commit de1ab6af5c3d92c0a031083962a7ff270cf301b7 upstream.
During the migration to HDA core code, we lost the workaround for 4k
BDL boundary. The flag exists in the new hdac\_bus, but it's never
set. This resulted in the sudden sound stall on some controllers that
require this workaround like Creative Recon3D.
This patch fixes the issue by setting the flag for such controllers
properly.

ALSA: hda - Disable 64bit address for Creative HDA controllers
commit cadd16ea33a938d49aee99edd4758cc76048b399 upstream.
We've had many reports that some Creative sound cards with CA0132
don't work well. Some reported that it starts working after reloading
the module, while some reported it starts working when a 32bit kernel
is used. All these facts seem implying that the chip fails to
communicate when the buffer is located in 64bit address.
This patch addresses these issues by just adding AZX\_DCAPS\_NO\_64BIT
flag to the corresponding PCI entries. I casually had a chance to
test an SB Recon3D board, and indeed this seems helping.
Although this hasn't been tested on all Creative devices, it's safer
to assume that this restriction applies to the rest of them, too. So
the flag is applied to all Creative entries.

timers: Use proper base migration in add\_timer\_on()
commit 22b886dd1018093920c4250dee2a9a3cb7cff7b8 upstream.
Regardless of the previous CPU a timer was on, add\_timer\_on()
currently simply sets timer->flags to the new CPU. As the caller must
be seeing the timer as idle, this is locally fine, but the timer
leaving the old base while unlocked can lead to race conditions as
follows.
Let's say timer was on cpu 0.
cpu 0 cpu 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
del\_timer(timer) succeeds
del\_timer(timer)
lock\_timer\_base(timer) locks cpu\_0\_base
add\_timer\_on(timer, 1)
spin\_lock(&cpu\_1\_base->lock)
timer->flags set to cpu\_1\_base
operates on @timer operates on @timer
This triggered with mod\_delayed\_work\_on() which contains
"if (del\_timer()) add\_timer\_on()" sequence eventually leading to the
following oops.

commit 71b3c126e61177eb693423f2e18a1914205b165e upstream.
When switch\_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
will be sent. In order for that to work correctly, the bit
needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
starting to fill the local TLB.
Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
a couple that were missing.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prohibit setting illegal transaction state in MSR
commit c20875a3e638e4a03e099b343ec798edd1af5cc6 upstream.
Currently it is possible for userspace (e.g. QEMU) to set a value
for the MSR for a guest VCPU which has both of the TS bits set,
which is an illegal combination. The result of this is that when
we execute a hrfid (hypervisor return from interrupt doubleword)
instruction to enter the guest, the CPU will take a TM Bad Thing
type of program interrupt (vector 0x700).
Now, if PR KVM is configured in the kernel along with HV KVM, we
actually handle this without crashing the host or giving hypervisor
privilege to the guest; instead what happens is that we deliver a
program interrupt to the guest, with SRR0 reflecting the address
of the hrfid instruction and SRR1 containing the MSR value at that
point. If PR KVM is not configured in the kernel, then we try to
run the host's program interrupt handler with the MMU set to the
guest context, which almost certainly causes a host crash.
This closes the hole by making kvmppc\_set\_msr\_hv() check for the
illegal combination and force the TS field to a safe value (00,
meaning non-transactional).

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't dynamically split core when already split
commit f74f2e2e26199f695ca3df94f29e9ab7cb707ea4 upstream.
In static micro-threading modes, the dynamic micro-threading code
is supposed to be disabled, because subcores can't make independent
decisions about what micro-threading mode to put the core in - there is
only one micro-threading mode for the whole core. The code that
implements dynamic micro-threading checks for this, except that the
check was missed in one case. This means that it is possible for a
subcore in static 2-way micro-threading mode to try to put the core
into 4-way micro-threading mode, which usually leads to stuck CPUs,
spinlock lockups, and other stalls in the host.
The problem was in the can\_split\_piggybacked\_subcores() function, which
should always return false if the system is in a static micro-threading
mode. This fixes the problem by making can\_split\_piggybacked\_subcores()
use subcore\_config\_ok() for its checks, as subcore\_config\_ok() includes
the necessary check for the static micro-threading modes.
Credit to Gautham Shenoy for working out that the reason for the hangs
and stalls we were seeing was that we were trying to do dynamic 4-way
micro-threading while we were in static 2-way mode.

In addition, even if those maps could partcipate in NUMA

x86/mce: Ensure offline CPUs don't participate in rendezvous process
commit d90167a941f62860f35eb960e1012aa2d30e7e94 upstream.
Intel's MCA implementation broadcasts MCEs to all CPUs on the
node. This poses a problem for offlined CPUs which cannot
participate in the rendezvous process:
Kernel panic - not syncing: Timeout: Not all CPUs entered broadcast exception handler
Kernel Offset: disabled
Rebooting in 100 seconds..
More specifically, Linux does a soft offline of a CPU when
writing a 0 to /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/online, which
doesn't prevent the #MC exception from being broadcasted to that
CPU.
Ensure that offline CPUs don't participate in the MCE rendezvous
and clear the RIP valid status bit so that a second MCE won't
cause a shutdown.
Without the patch, mce\_start() will increment mce\_callin and
wait for all CPUs. Offlined CPUs should avoid participating in
the rendezvous process altogether.

x86/paravirt: Prevent rtc\_cmos platform device init on PV guests
commit d8c98a1d1488747625ad6044d423406e17e99b7a upstream.
Adding the rtc platform device in non-privileged Xen PV guests causes
an IRQ conflict because these guests do not have legacy PIC and may
allocate irqs in the legacy range.
In a single VCPU Xen PV guest we should have:
/proc/interrupts:
CPU0
0: 4934 xen-percpu-virq timer0
1: 0 xen-percpu-ipi spinlock0
2: 0 xen-percpu-ipi resched0
3: 0 xen-percpu-ipi callfunc0
4: 0 xen-percpu-virq debug0
5: 0 xen-percpu-ipi callfuncsingle0
6: 0 xen-percpu-ipi irqwork0
7: 321 xen-dyn-event xenbus
8: 90 xen-dyn-event hvc\_console
...
But hvc\_console cannot get its interrupt because it is already in use
by rtc0 and the console does not work.
genirq: Flags mismatch irq 8. 00000000 (hvc\_console) vs. 00000000 (rtc0)
We can avoid this problem by realizing that unprivileged PV guests (both
Xen and lguests) are not supposed to have rtc\_cmos device and so
adding it is not necessary.
Privileged guests (i.e. Xen's dom0) do use it but they should not have
irq conflicts since they allocate irqs above legacy range (above
gsi\_top, in fact).
Instead of explicitly testing whether the guest is privileged we can
extend pv\_info structure to include information about guest's RTC
support.

x86/mpx: Fix instruction decoder condition
commit 8e8efe0379bd93e8219ca0fc6fa80b5dd85b09cb upstream.
MPX decodes instructions in order to tell which bounds register
was violated. Part of this decoding involves looking at the "REX
prefix" which is a special instrucion prefix used to retrofit
support for new registers in to old instructions.
The X86\_REX\_\*() macros are defined to return actual bit values:
#define X86\_REX\_R(rex) ((rex) & 4)
\*not\* boolean values. However, the MPX code was checking for
them like they were booleans. This might have led to us
mis-decoding the "REX prefix" and giving false information out to
userspace about bounds violations. X86\_REX\_B() actually is bit 1,
so this is really only broken for the X86\_REX\_X() case.
Fix the conditionals up to tolerate the non-boolean values.

x86 smpboot: Re-enable init\_udelay=0 by default on modern CPUs
commit 656279a1f3b210cf48ccc572fd7c6b8e2250be77 upstream.
commit f1ccd249319e allowed the cmdline "cpu\_init\_udelay=" to work
with all values, including the default of 10000.
But in setting the default of 10000, it over-rode the code that sets
the delay 0 on modern processors.
Also, tidy up use of INT/UINT.

tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp\_cwnd\_reductionPatch 3759824da87b ("tcp: PRR uses CRB mode by default and SS mode
conditionally") introduced a bug that cwnd may become 0 when both
inflight and sndcnt are 0 (cwnd = inflight + sndcnt). This may lead
to a div-by-zero if the connection starts another cwnd reduction
phase by setting tp->prior\_cwnd to the current cwnd (0) in
tcp\_init\_cwnd\_reduction().
To prevent this we skip PRR operation when nothing is acked or
sacked. Then cwnd must be positive in all cases as long as ssthresh
is positive:
1) The proportional reduction mode
inflight > ssthresh > 0
2) The reduction bound mode
a) inflight == ssthresh > 0
b) inflight < ssthresh
sndcnt > 0 since newly\_acked\_sacked > 0 and inflight < ssthresh
Therefore in all cases inflight and sndcnt can not both be 0.
We check invalid tp->prior\_cwnd to avoid potential div0 bugs.
In reality this bug is triggered only with a sequence of less common
events. For example, the connection is terminating an ECN-triggered
cwnd reduction with an inflight 0, then it receives reordered/old
ACKs or DSACKs from prior transmission (which acks nothing). Or the
connection is in fast recovery stage that marks everything lost,
but fails to retransmit due to local issues, then receives data
packets from other end which acks nothing.
