{
  "CVE-2016-2841": {
    "description": "An infinite loop vulnerability exists in the NE2000 NIC emulation support of QEMU. This can be triggered when receiving packets over the network, leading to a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the ring buffer control registers (PSTART & PSTOP) in the NE2000 NIC emulation. Specifically, the code does not properly handle cases where `s->stop` is less than or equal to `s->start`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Infinite loop"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside the guest operating system can cause the QEMU instance to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending network packets to the emulated NE2000 NIC in a way that triggers the incorrect ring buffer handling."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Privileged access within the guest operating system."
    ]
  }
