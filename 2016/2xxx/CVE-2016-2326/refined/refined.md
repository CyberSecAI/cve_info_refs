Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2326:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of malformed media files within the Libav (and FFmpeg) libraries. Specifically, multiple demuxers and decoders within the library were affected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper input validation or handling of specifically crafted media files.
*   Potential memory corruption or other issues leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution due to the malformed input.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential for local file access:** One source mentions that the vulnerability could lead to accessing arbitrary local files.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious media files:** An attacker could craft a malicious media file and trick a user into opening it with an application that uses the vulnerable libav or FFmpeg libraries.
*   **Remote attacks:** The vulnerabilities are classified as "remote exploitable" because the malicious file could be delivered remotely (e.g., via email, web download).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted media file to the victim.
*   The attacker relies on the victim using an application that is linked against the vulnerable library (libav or FFmpeg) to open the file.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both FFmpeg and libav libraries.
*   Multiple CVEs are often associated with this type of vulnerability, including CVE-2016-1897 and CVE-2016-1898, in addition to CVE-2016-2326
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves upgrading to a version that contains the backported security fixes
