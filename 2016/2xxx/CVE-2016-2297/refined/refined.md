Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Meteocontrol WEB'log management application offers a command (CMD) shell that allows execution of a restricted set of commands. This feature is accessible without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access to CMD Shell:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control for the CMD shell feature. No authentication is required to access and use it.
*   **Command Injection:** While the content mentions a restricted set of commands, it implies the possibility of command injection if not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The CMD shell allows for running commands that provide host, application, and stats data, leading to potential disclosure of sensitive information about the system and its environment.
*   **System Manipulation (Potential):** Although the set of commands is described as restricted, it is implied that some system manipulation might be possible, as well as further exploitation depending on the specific commands. The content mentions that "assuming no one will be able to figure out a technique to exploit this feature is not a great idea."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** The CMD shell is accessible directly through a specific URL (`http://IP/html/en/xprtCmd.html`).
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning that the attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the WEB'log device.
*   **Low Skill:** The exploit is considered easily achievable for an attacker with low technical skills.

**Additional Information**

*   The provided text specifies that a CVSS v3 base score of 9.4 has been calculated for CVE-2016-2297, with the vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).
