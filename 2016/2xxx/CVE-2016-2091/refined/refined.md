Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2091:

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read
*   **Location:** libdwarf-20151114, specifically in `dwarf_read_cie_fde_prefix` (dwarf\_frame2.c:934)
*   **Root Cause:** The `memcpy` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer. This occurs during the processing of CIE (Common Information Entry) or FDE (Frame Description Entry) prefixes in DWARF debugging information. The DWARF CHECK error message "DW\_DLE\_DEBUG\_FRAME\_LENGTH\_NOT\_MULTIPLE" suggests an issue with the length field in the CIE.
*   **Impact:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to crashes or potentially information disclosure. The valgrind output shows an "Invalid read of size 2".
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted ELF file with a malformed DWARF section, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted ELF file to be processed by a tool using libdwarf.
*   **Affected versions:** libdwarf-20151114
