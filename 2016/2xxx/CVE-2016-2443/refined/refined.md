Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-2443:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm MDP (Mobile Display Processor) driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation could lead to a local privilege escalation.
- An attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution within the kernel.
- This could potentially result in a permanent device compromise, possibly requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the vulnerable device.
- The attacker's malicious app must have the capability to interact with the vulnerable Qualcomm MDP driver.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity, not "Critical". This is because while it allows kernel code execution, it requires first compromising a service that can call the vulnerable driver.
- The patch for this issue is not in AOSP, and it is included in the latest binary drivers from the Google Developer site.
- Affected devices include Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013).
- The vulnerability was reported on January 5, 2016.
