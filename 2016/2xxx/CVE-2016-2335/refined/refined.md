{
  "CVE-2016-2335": {
    "Description": "The CInArchive::ReadFileItem method in Archive/Udf/UdfIn.cpp in 7zip 9.20 and 15.05 beta and p7zip allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or execute arbitrary code via the PartitionRef field in the Long Allocation Descriptor in a UDF file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check on the 'PartitionRef' field of the Long Allocation Descriptor when processing UDF files. Specifically, the `CInArchive::ReadFileItem` method accesses `Partitions` vector using `vol.PartitionMaps[lad.Location.PartitionRef].PartitionIndex` without verifying if `lad.Location.PartitionRef` is a valid index.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service due to an out-of-bounds read. In some circumstances, it may also allow for arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted UDF archive file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted UDF file to the vulnerable application. This can be achieved via network or local file system access."
