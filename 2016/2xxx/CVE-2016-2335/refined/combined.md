Package        : p7zip
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2335
Debian Bug     : 824160

Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos discovered an out-of-bound read
vulnerability in the CInArchive::ReadFileItem method in p7zip, a 7zr
file archiver with high compression ratio. A remote attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial-of-service or, potentially the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
p7zip, if a specially crafted UDF file is processed.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.1+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 15.14.1+dfsg-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 15.14.1+dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your p7zip packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of

keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0094

## 7zip UDF CInArchive::ReadFileItem Code Execution Vulnerability

##### May 10, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-2335

### Summary

An out of bound read vulnerability exists in the CInArchive::ReadFileItem method functionality of 7zip for handling UDF files that can lead to denial of service or code execution.

### Tested Versions

7-Zip [32] 15.05 beta
7-Zip [64] 9.20

### Product URLs

http://www.7-zip.org/

### Details

CInArchive::ReadFileItem method to achieve proper information about file/directory location on particular partition use inter alia the following information:
Partition Map and Long Allocation Descriptor [2.3.10.1 Long Allocation Descriptor].
Because volumes can have more than one partition map their objects are keep in object vector. To start looking for item, method tries to achieve proper partition object
using to this mentioned partition maps object vector and “PartitionRef” field from Long Allocation Descriptor. Lack of checking whether “PartitionRef” field
is bigger than available amount of partition map objects cause read out of bounds and can lead in some circumstances to arbitrary code execution.

Vulnerable code:

```
CPP\7zip\Archive\Udf\UdfIn.cpp

Line 898    FOR_VECTOR (fsIndex, vol.FileSets)
Line 899    {
Line 900      CFileSet &fs = vol.FileSets[fsIndex];

```

Vulnerability can be triggered for any entry contains malformed long allocation descriptor but
in this example we will focus on File set RootDirICB [2.3.2 File Set Descriptor].

As you can see in above code in lines 898-905 search for elements on particular volume and file set starts based on RootDirICB Long Allocation Descriptor
and that record we will try to malformed for our purpose.
Vulnerability appears in line 392 when PartitionRef field exceed number of elements in ParitionMaps vector.
Let we check how many PartitionMaps contains our PoC:

```

```

As we can see there is 1 Partition map where our PartitionRef field is equal:
0:000> dv /t lad

0:000> dt /b NArchive::NUdf::CLongAllocDesc poi(lad)

At the end, let us see how FileSet RootDirICB entry has been modified.

```
Original file:

Malformed file:

```

As you can see at offset 00080990 + 8, 0x00 changed to 0xff which we could observe during bug analysis as a value of PartitionRef.

# Multiple 7-Zip Vulnerabilities Discovered by Talos

By
[Jaeson Schultz](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/author/jaeson-schultz/)

Wednesday, May 11, 2016 11:30

[Vulnerability Spotlight](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/vulnerability-spotlight/)

*7-Zip vulnerabilities were discovered by Marcin Noga.*

*Update 2016-05-12:* Related advisories for the 7-Zip issues covered in this blog can be found here:
 <http://www.talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0093/>
<http://www.talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0094/>

7-Zip is an open-source file archiving application which features optional AES-256 encryption, support for large files, and the ability to use “[any compression, conversion or encryption method](http://www.7-zip.org/7z.html)”. Recently Cisco Talos has discovered multiple exploitable vulnerabilities in 7-Zip. These type of vulnerabilities are especially concerning since vendors may not be aware they are using the affected libraries. This can be of particular concern, for example, when it comes to security devices or antivirus products. 7-Zip is supported on all major platforms, and is one of the most popular archive utilities in-use today. Users may be surprised to discover just how [many products and appliances](https://www.google.com/#q=http:%2F%2F7-zip.org%2Flicense.txt) are affected.

### TALOS-CAN-0094, Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability, [CVE-2016-2335]

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the way 7-Zip handles Universal Disk Format (UDF) files. The UDF file system was meant to replace the ISO-9660 file format, and was eventually adopted as the official file system for DVD-Video and DVD-Audio.

Central to 7-Zip’s processing of UDF files is the CInArchive::ReadFileItem method. Because volumes can have more than one partition map, their objects are kept in an object vector. To start looking for an item, this method tries to reference the proper object using the partition map’s object vector and the "PartitionRef" field from the Long Allocation Descriptor. Lack of checking whether the "PartitionRef" field is bigger than the available amount of partition map objects causes a read out-of-bounds and can lead, in some circumstances, to arbitrary code execution.

#### Vulnerable code:

CPP\7zip\Archive\Udf\UdfIn.cpp

```
Line 898    FOR_VECTOR (fsIndex, vol.FileSets)
Line 899    {
Line 900      CFileSet &fs = vol.FileSets[fsIndex];
Line 901      unsigned fileIndex = Files.Size();
Line 902      Files.AddNew();
Line 903      RINOK(ReadFileItem(volIndex, fsIndex, fs.RootDirICB, kNumRecursionLevelsMax));
Line 904      RINOK(FillRefs(fs, fileIndex, -1, kNumRecursionLevelsMax));
Line 905    }
(...)
Line 384        HRESULT CInArchive::ReadFileItem(int volIndex, int fsIndex, const CLongAllocDesc &lad, int numRecurseAllowed)
Line 385        {
Line 386          if (Files.Size() % 100 == 0)
Line 387                RINOK(_progress->SetCompleted(Files.Size(), _processedProgressBytes));
Line 388          if (numRecurseAllowed-- == 0)
Line 389                return S_FALSE;
Line 390          CFile &file = Files.Back();
Line 391          const CLogVol &vol = LogVols[volIndex];
Line 392          CPartition &partition = Partitions[vol.PartitionMaps[lad.Location.PartitionRef].PartitionIndex];
```

 This vulnerability can be triggered by any entry that contains a malformed Long Allocation Descriptor. As you can see in lines 898-905 from the code above, the program searches for elements on a particular volume, and the file-set starts based on the RootDirICB Long Allocation Descriptor. That record can be purposely malformed for malicious purpose. The vulnerability appears in line 392, when the PartitionRef field exceeds the number of elements in PartitionMaps vector.

### TALOS-CAN-0093, Heap Overflow Vulnerability, [CVE-2016-2334]

An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the Archive::NHfs::CHandler::ExtractZlibFile method functionality of 7-Zip. In the HFS+ file system, files can be stored in compressed form using zlib. There are three different ways of keeping data in that form depending on the size of the data. Data from files whose compressed size is bigger than 3800 bytes is stored in a resource fork, split into blocks.

Block size information and their offsets are kept in a table just after the resource fork header. Prior to decompression, the ExtractZlibFile method reads the block size and its offset from the file. After that, it reads block data into static size buffer "buf". There is no check whether the size of the block is bigger than size of the buffer "buf", which can result in a malformed block size which exceeds the mentioned "buf" size. This will cause a buffer overflow and subsequent heap corruption.

#### Vulnerable code:

7zip\src\7z1505-src\CPP\7zip\Archive\HfsHandler.cpp

```
Line 1496        HRESULT CHandler::ExtractZlibFile(
Line 1497                ISequentialOutStream *outStream,
Line 1498                const CItem &item,
Line 1499                NCompress::NZlib::CDecoder *_zlibDecoderSpec,
Line 1500                CByteBuffer &buf,
Line 1501                UInt64 progressStart,
Line 1502                IArchiveExtractCallback *extractCallback)
Line 1503        {
Line 1504          CMyComPtr inStream;
Line 1505          const CFork &fork = item.ResourceFork;
Line 1506          RINOK(GetForkStream(fork, &inStream));
Line 1507          const unsigned kHeaderSize = 0x100 + 8;
Line 1508          RINOK(ReadStream_FALSE(inStream, buf, kHeaderSize));
Line 1509          UInt32 dataPos = Get32(buf);
Line 1510          UInt32 mapPos = Get32(buf + 4);
Line 1511          UInt32 dataSize = Get32(buf + 8);
Line 1512          UInt32 mapSize = Get32(buf + 12);
(...)
Line 1538          RINOK(ReadStream_FALSE(inStream, tableBuf, tableSize));
Line 1539
Line 1540          UInt32 prev = 4 + tableSize;
Line 1541
Line 1542          UInt32 i;
Line 1543          for (i = 0; i < numBlocks; i++)
Line 1544          {
Line 1545                UInt32 offset = GetUi32(tableBuf + i * 8);
Line 1546                UInt32 size = GetUi32(tableBuf + i * 8 + 4);
Line 1547                if (size == 0)
Line 1548                  return S_FALSE;
Line 1549                if (prev != offset)
Line 1550                  return S_FALSE;
Line 1551                if (offset > dataSize2 ||
Line 1552                        size > dataSize2 - offset)
Line 1553                  return S_FALSE;
Line 1554                prev = offset + size;
Line 1555          }
Line 1556
Line 1557          if (prev != dataSize2)
Line 1558                return S_FALSE;
Line 1559
Line 1560          CBufInStream *bufInStreamSpec = new CBufInStream;
Line 1561          CMyComPtr bufInStream = bufInStreamSpec;
Line 1562
Line 1563          UInt64 outPos = 0;
Line 1564          for (i = 0; i < numBlocks; i++)
Line 1565          {
Line 1566                UInt64 rem = item.UnpackSize - outPos;
Line 1567                if (rem == 0)
Line 1568                  return S_FALSE;
Line 1569                UInt32 blockSize = kCompressionBlockSize;
Line 1570                if (rem < kCompressionBlockSize)
Line 1571                  blockSize = (UInt32)rem;
Line 1572
Line 1573                UInt32 size = GetUi32(tableBuf + i * 8 + 4);
Line 1574
Line 1575                RINOK(ReadStream_FALSE(inStream, buf, size)); // !!! HEAP OVERFLOW !!!
```

During extraction from an HFS+ image, having compressed files with a "com.apple.decmpfs" attribute and data stored in a resource fork, we land in the above code.

Compressed file data is split into blocks and each block before decompression is read into "buf", as we can see in Line 1575. Based on the "size" value ReadStream\_FALSE, which under the hood is really just the ReadFile API, reads a portion of data into "buf" buffer.

The buffer "buf" definition and its size we can observe from ExtractZlibFile’s caller, the CHandler::Extract method. As you can see, its size is constant and equal to 0x10010 bytes.

```
Line 1633        STDMETHODIMP CHandler::Extract(const UInt32 *indices, UInt32 numItems,
Line 1634                Int32 testMode, IArchiveExtractCallback *extractCallback)
Line 1635        {
(...)
Line 1652
Line 1653          const size_t kBufSize = kCompressionBlockSize; // 0x10000
Line 1654          CByteBuffer buf(kBufSize + 0x10); // we need 1 additional bytes for uncompressed chunk header
(...)
Line 1729          HRESULT hres = ExtractZlibFile(realOutStream, item, _zlibDecoderSpec, buf,
Line 1730            currentTotalSize, extractCallback);
```

 Going back to the ExtractZlibFile method, Line 1573 sets the block "size" value read from tableBuf. tableBuf in Line 1538 is read from the file, meaning that the "size" is just a part of data coming from the file itself, so we can influence its value. Setting a value for "size" bigger than 0x10010 should achieve a buffer overflow and as a result achieve heap corruption.

Before Line 1573, the value of the "size" variable is read in a loop included in lines 1543-1555. This block of code is responsible for checking whether data blocks are consistent, which means that:
    - the data block should start just after tableBuf, Line 1540
    - the following data block should start at previous block size + offset, Line 1549
    - the offset should not be bigger than dataSize2 (size of compressed data) Line 1551
    - "size" should not be bigger than the remaining data, Line 1552

As we can see there is no check regarding whether the "size" is bigger than "buf" size. The constraints described above don't have influence on it either.

### Conclusion

Sadly, many security vulnerabilities arise from applications which fail to properly validate their input data. Both of these 7-Zip vulnerabilities resulted from flawed input validation. Because data can come from a potentially untrusted source, data input validation is of critical importance to all applications’ security. Talos has worked with 7-Zip to responsibly disclose, and then patch these vulnerabilities. Users are urged to update their vulnerable versions of 7-Zip to the latest revision, version 16.00, as soon as possible.

TALOS-CAN-0093 is detected by sids 38323-38326.
 TALOS-CAN-0094 is detected by sids 38293-38296.

# 7-Zip: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-27**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in 7-Zip, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/p7zip** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **16.02-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **16.02-r1** |

### Background

7-Zip is an open-source file archiver, an application used primarily to
compress files. 7-Zip uses its own 7z archive format, but can read and
write several other archive formats.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in 7-Zip. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
archive file possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All 7-Zip users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/p7zip-16.02-r1"

```

## Binary packages built by this source

[p7zip](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/p7zip):
7z file archiver with high compression ratio

p7zip is the Unix command-line port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that

 archives with high compression ratios.

 .

 p7zip provides:

  - /usr/bin/7zr

    a standalone minimal version of the 7-zip tool that only handles

    7z archives. 7z compression is 30-50% better than ZIP compression.

  - /usr/bin/p7zip

    a gzip-like wrapper around 7zr.

 .

 p7zip can be used with popular compression interfaces (such as File

 Roller or Nautilus).

 .

 p7zip-full provides 7z and 7za which support more compression formats.

[p7zip-full](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/p7zip-full):
7z and 7za file archivers with high compression ratio

p7zip is the Unix command-line port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that

 archives with high compression ratios.

 .

 p7zip-full provides utilities to pack and unpack 7z archives within

 a shell or using a GUI (such as Ark, File Roller or Nautilus).

 .

 Installing p7zip-full allows File Roller to use the very efficient 7z

 compression format for packing and unpacking files and directories.

 Additionally, it provides the 7z and 7za commands.

 .

 List of supported formats:

   - Packing / unpacking: 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2, XZ and TAR

   - Unpacking only: APM, ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT,

     HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, LZMA2, MBR, MSI, MSLZ, NSIS, NTFS, RAR (only

     if non-free p7zip-rar package is installed), RPM, SquashFS, UDF,

     VHD, WIM, XAR and Z.

 .

 p7zip provides 7zr, a light version of 7za, and p7zip, a gzip-like

 wrapper around 7zr.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1335575#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-05-12 14:32:03 UTC  ```  An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the way 7-Zip handles Universal Disk Format (UDF) files. The UDF file system was meant to replace the ISO-9660 file format, and was eventually adopted as the official file system for DVD-Video and DVD-Audio.  Central to 7-Zip’s processing of UDF files is the CInArchive::ReadFileItem method. Because volumes can have more than one partition map, their objects are kept in an object vector. To start looking for an item, this method tries to reference the proper object using the partition map’s object vector and the "PartitionRef" field from the Long Allocation Descriptor. Lack of checking whether the "PartitionRef" field is bigger than the available amount of partition map objects causes a read out-of-bounds and can lead, in some circumstances, to arbitrary code execution.
