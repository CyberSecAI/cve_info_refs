- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the transmission of data in cleartext within IBM Tivoli Remote Control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the cleartext transmission of potentially sensitive information. This means that data is not encrypted during transit, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user could potentially intercept and obtain sensitive information being transmitted by IBM Tivoli Remote Control.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves capturing network traffic during the communication of the IBM Tivoli Remote Control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic and needs to be an authenticated user.
