The provided content relates to CVE-2016-2357.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Milesight IP security cameras contain a hard-coded SSL private key. This key is the same across all cameras from this vendor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded SSL private key.
- The same hardcoded key is used across all cameras from the same vendor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks can be performed without raising warnings, even if the camera administrator has pinned the certificate.
- If an attacker gains non-root access, they can modify the certificates after the camera starts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based MitM attacks.
- Exploitation of other vulnerabilities to gain access and modify certificates.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform network-based MitM attacks, such as being on the same network as the camera or being able to intercept network traffic.
- For certificate modification, requires non-root access on the camera system after it has started.
