Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **incorrect capability check** in Moodle when displaying user emails in the participants list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system fails to properly verify if a user (specifically, a teacher) has the necessary permissions to view student email addresses in the participants list. This leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Teachers who should not have access to student email addresses can view them in the participants list. This is a privacy breach that could be exploited to gather students' email addresses without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   No special attacker capabilities are required, simply being a teacher in a course where the vulnerability is present.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a teacher within a Moodle course.
*   The teacher must not have the specific permission that allows them to view student emails.
