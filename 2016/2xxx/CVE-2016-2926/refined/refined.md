- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input in IBM Jazz Foundation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website, and potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially-crafted URL that, when clicked by a victim, triggers the execution of malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. The attacker must be a remote user, no specific network position is mentioned.
