- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When the instance `runAsUser` property is set in IBM InfoSphere Streams, operator code might incorrectly use the group ID of the root user instead of the intended group ID of the `runAsUser` for permission checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect permission checking due to the use of the root group ID instead of the `runAsUser` group ID when the `runAsUser` property is set.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data/resources controlled by the intended user, leading to confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `runAsUser` property is configured on the InfoSphere Streams instance and operator code performs permission checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have the ability to influence or set the `runAsUser` property and execute operator code that performs permission checks within the affected IBM InfoSphere Streams environment.

This content provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying that the issue occurs when the `runAsUser` property is set, which leads to the incorrect group ID being used in permission checks.
