# Security Advisory - Sixteen OpenSSL Vulnerabilities on Some Huawei products

* SA No:huawei-sa-20170322-01-openssl
* Initial Release Date:
  Mar 22, 2017
* Last Release Date:
  Jul 04, 2018

Summary

Statem/statem.c in OpenSSL 1.1.0a does not consider memory-block movement after a realloc call, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TLS session. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2016-09065)

This vulnerability has been assigned a CVE ID: CVE-2016-6309

Crypto/x509/x509\_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by triggering a CRL operation. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2016-09078)

This vulnerability has been assigned a CVE ID: CVE-2016-7052

Multiple memory leaks in t1\_lib.c in OpenSSL before 1.0.1u, 1.0.2 before 1.0.2i, and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via large OCSP Status Request extensions. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2016-09079)

This vulnerability has been assigned a CVE ID: CVE-2016-6304

The ssl3\_read\_bytes function in record/rec\_layer\_s3.c in OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by triggering a zero-length record in an SSL\_peek call. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2016-09080)

This vulnerability has been assigned a CVE ID: CVE-2016-6305

The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.

#### Description

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid
usernames via a timing attack.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

What you are saying is all valid on paper. But when you move to the
uarch level, the techniques we are using are very specific --- rdtsc
and clflush instructions, paired with targeted malicious performance
degradation techniques. When you take away these tools, it really
complicates things for an attacker.

> Are the orders of magnitude in range?

This is more of an interesting research question that would take maybe
six months to definitively answer.

#### Description

OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, related to s3\_srvr.c, ssl\_sess.c, and t1\_lib.c.

Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
the severity of this vulnerability is Low.

Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we’re aware of, either only “named
curves” are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can’t represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an “exotic”
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC\_GROUP\_new\_curve\_GF2m(), EC\_GROUP\_new\_from\_params(),
and various supporting BN\_GF2m\_\*() functions.

Applications working with “exotic” explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, …) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don’t perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain. So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL\_select\_next\_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL\_select\_next\_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL\_select\_next\_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client\_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client\_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a “no overlap”
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function is accidentally called with a
client\_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_free\_buffers may cause
memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL\_free\_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not
vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by
applications.

The SSL\_free\_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used
when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected
to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have
been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the
network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.
In this case calling SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though a record has only
been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has
been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of
this data. Again a call to SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though the buffer
is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check()
or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded
memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL\_OP\_NO\_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early\_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12\_parse(),
PKCS12\_unpack\_p7data(), PKCS12\_unpack\_p7encdata(), PKCS12\_unpack\_authsafes()
and PKCS12\_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME\_write\_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take
a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is not called from other OpenSSL

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.

Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_generate\_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications
that use DH\_check\_pub\_key(), DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

While DH\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),
DH\_check\_pub\_key() doesn’t make any of these checks, and is therefore
vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.

Likewise, while DH\_generate\_key() performs a check for an excessively large
P, it doesn’t check for an excessively large Q.

An application that calls DH\_generate\_key() or DH\_check\_pub\_key() and
supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

DH\_generate\_key() and DH\_check\_pub\_key() are also called by a number of
other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other
functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this
are DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex(), EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check(), and EVP\_PKEY\_generate().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the
“-pubcheck” option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() or
EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() the provided OSSL\_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length,
via the “keylen” parameter or the IV length, via the “ivlen” parameter,
within the OSSL\_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST’s SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because
the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.

OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the
Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86\_64 processors supporting the
AVX512-IFMA instructions.

Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker
can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does
not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform
when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to
the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their
previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\_64 processors
supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so
the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,
if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent
calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD
cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using
OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of
any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we
consider this a Low severity security issue.

As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at
runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\_ia32cap:

OPENSSL\_ia32cap=:~0x200000

The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,
if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is
unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
The other functions affected by this are DH\_check\_ex() and
EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the “-check” option.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those
checks confirms that the modulus (‘p’ parameter) is not too large. Trying to use
a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which
is over 10,000 bits in length.

However the DH\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters
that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value
even if it has already been found to be too large.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
The other functions affected by this are DH\_check\_ex() and

Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as
a consequence.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to
authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing,
adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL
implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.

The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
application has to call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP\_CipherUpdate()) with
NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call
instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
The empty data thus will not be authenticated.

As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and
we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or
data containing them may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ\_obj2txt() directly, or use any of
the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message
size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those
messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.

An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -
most of which have no size limit. OBJ\_obj2txt() may be used to translate
an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL
type ASN1\_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the
sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by
periods.

When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large
(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds
of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long
time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with ’n’ being the size of the
sub-identifiers in bytes (\*).

With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /
identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching
algorithms.

Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure
AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify
what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or
decrypt, or digest passed data.

Applications that call OBJ\_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are
affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose
of display, the severity is considered low.

In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,
CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509
certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.

The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a
100KiB limit on the peer’s certificate chain. Additionally, this only
impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
authentication.

In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,
such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way
that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered
not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
and the severity is therefore considered low.

Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM
platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,
leading to a crash.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM
platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually
used for disk encryption.

The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read
past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16
byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext
buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of
service.

If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue
a Low severity one.

The function X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was
decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy()
function.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate
policy check need to use X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_policies() or explicitly
enable the policy check by calling X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set\_flags() with
the X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK flag argument.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not
commonly used by applications.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be
vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by
OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.
A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies
in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions

of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains
that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this
vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers
exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service
(DoS) attack on affected systems.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.

The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS
enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading
the legacy provider.

PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
not call these functions however third party applications would be
affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
data.

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL\_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp as an ASN1\_TYPE rather than an
ASN1\_STRING.

When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network.

The public API function BIO\_new\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
end user applications.

The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\_f\_asn1 filter
BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
to call BIO\_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
likely result in a crash.

This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\_write\_ASN1() which
may cause BIO\_new\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\_pop() on
the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
PEM\_write\_bio\_ASN1\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_CMS\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_PKCS7\_stream,
SMIME\_write\_ASN1, SMIME\_write\_CMS and SMIME\_write\_PKCS7.

Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
i2d\_ASN1\_bio\_stream, BIO\_new\_CMS, BIO\_new\_PKCS7, i2d\_CMS\_bio\_stream and
i2d\_PKCS7\_bio\_stream.

The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.

The function PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
decodes the “name” (e.g. “CERTIFICATE”), any header data and the payload data.
If the function succeeds then the “name\_out”, “header” and “data” arguments are
populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The
caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a
PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\_read\_bio\_ex()
will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer
to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer
then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM
files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.

The functions PEM\_read\_bio() and PEM\_read() are simple wrappers around
PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.

These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
functions including PEM\_X509\_INFO\_read\_bio\_ex() and
SSL\_CTX\_use\_serverinfo\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal
uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the
header argument if PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
include the PEM\_read\_bio\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in
OpenSSL 3.0.

The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker
would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for
decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an
encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a
sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
application data sent over that connection.

A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs
after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a
CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
to a trusted issuer.

The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to
a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure
of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext)
although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory
contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.

In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
client authentication and a malicious client connects.

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy
processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() and EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID\_undef as this value in the call to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). When NID\_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() using NID\_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86\_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86\_64 architecture are affected by this issue.

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasnât written. In the special case of âin placeâ encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.

In addition to the c\_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c\_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

The OPENSSL\_LH\_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common.

The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP\_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP\_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL âocspâ application. When verifying an ocsp response with the â-no\_cert\_checksâ option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.

The BN\_mod\_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN\_mod\_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022.

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021, and the release of 1.0.2zc on the 22nd of February 2022. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms.

Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509\_verify\_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL\_connect() or SSL\_do\_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL\_get\_error() to return the value SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL\_CTX\_set\_cert\_verify\_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY return value from SSL\_get\_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509\_verify\_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1\_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSLâs own âd2iâ functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1\_STRING\_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1\_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1\_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the âdataâ and âlengthâ fields in the ASN1\_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1\_STRING\_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1\_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1\_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the âdataâ field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1\_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509\_get1\_email(), X509\_REQ\_get1\_email() and X509\_get1\_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1\_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the âoutâ parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the âoutlenâ parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the âoutâ parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a âpurposeâ has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named âpurposeâ values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature\_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature\_algorithms\_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSLâs s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the â-crl\_downloadâ option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSLâs parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked.

The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue.

Server or client applications that call the SSL\_check\_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the âsignature\_algorithms\_certâ TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d.

In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS\_decrypt or PKCS7\_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt.

If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable ânon-stitchedâ ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted.

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the âprefix / âopenssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be â/usr/localâ. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of âC:/usr/localâ, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSLâs default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, â/usr/local/sslâ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own âprefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

There is an overflow bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN\_mod\_exp may be affected if they use BN\_FLG\_CONSTTIME.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL\_init\_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL\_INIT\_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used.

ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.

During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.

There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an âerror stateâ mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL\_do\_handshake(), SSL\_accept() and SSL\_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL\_read() or SSL\_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attackerâs direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a, released on 22nd September 2016. The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.

A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms. The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.

A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the âno-ocspâ build time option are not affected. Servers using OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in a default configuration, instead only if an application explicitly enables OCSP stapling support.

An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE\_MAX which is impractical on most platforms.

If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will ultimately crash. The use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets is comparatively rare as it requires a custom server callback and ticket lookup mechanism.

Because DES (and triple-DES) has only a 64-bit block size, birthday attacks are a real concern. For example, with the ability to run Javascript in a browser, it is possible to send enough traffic to cause a collision, and then use that information to recover something like a session Cookie. Triple-DES, which shows up as âDES-CBC3â in an OpenSSL cipher string, is still used on the Web, and major browsers are not yet willing to completely disable it. If you run a server, you should disable triple-DES. This is generally a configuration issue. If you run an old server that doesnât support any better ciphers than DES or RC4, you should upgrade. For 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, we removed the triple-DES ciphers from the âHIGHâ keyword and put them into âMEDIUM.â Note that we did not remove them from the âDEFAULTâ keyword. For the 1.1.0 release, we treat triple-DES just like we are treating RC4. It is not compiled by default; you have to use âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ as a config option. Even when those ciphers are compiled, triple-DES is only in the âMEDIUMâ keyword. In addition we also removed it from the âDEFAULTâ keyword.

A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that arrive for future epochs update the replay protection âwindowâ before the MAC for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific DTLS connection.

In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simulataneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.

Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: âp + len > limitâ Where âpâ points to some mallocâd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE âlenâ here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message). The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that âp + lenâ is only well defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour. For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for âpâ such that âp + lenâ actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len < limit.

This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of the bug was not known at the time. In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in i2c\_ASN1\_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create ânegative zeroesâ when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug. However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i\_ASN1\_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY structures. Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations. Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSLâs default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.

A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP\_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP\_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP\_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP\_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Internally to OpenSSL the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM\_write\_bio\* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM\_write\_bio\* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).

A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if theyâve not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time. Builds that are not configured with âenable-ssl2â will not support SSLv2. Even if âenable-ssl2â is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23\_method() will need to explicitly call either of: SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options(ctx, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); or SSL\_clear\_options(ssl, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2\_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured with âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ will not provide any âEXPORTâ or âLOWâ strength ciphers.

The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a â%sâ format string in the BIO\_\*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally the internal |doapr\_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT\_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long â%sâ format string. Memory leaks can also occur. The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

The SRP user database lookup method SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user had confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in constant time.

In the BN\_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value |i|. Later |bn\_expand| is called with a value of |i \* 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn\_expand| not allocating any memory because |i \* 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i \* 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN\_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.

This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. s2\_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation.

Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on âsafeâ primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be âsafeâ. Where an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not âsafeâ then an attacker could use this fact to find a peerâs private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS serverâs private DH exponent if itâs reusing the private DH exponent or itâs using a static DH ciphersuite. OpenSSL provides the option SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk. OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if: - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh() is used and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not set. - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used, and both the parameters and the key are set and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not used. This is an undocumted feature and parameter files donât contain the key. - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2. It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if: - SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is set - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used and the callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is almost always used like this. Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using: - genpkey with the dh\_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file including the prime-order subgroup size âqâ. This is supported since the 1.0.2 version. Older versions canât read files generated in this way. - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as requiring the single use. The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a âqâ parameter is available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. This could have some performance impact. Additionally the SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

Multiblock corrupted pointer. OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the âmultiblockâ performance improvement. This feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of âmultiblockâ can cause OpenSSLâs internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking IO. Typically, when the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connection. However if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentation fault will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attack.

OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature algorithm and signature encodings. OpenSSL also does not enforce a match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned portions of the certificate. By modifying the contents of the signature algorithm or the encoding of the signature, it is possible to change the certificateâs fingerprint. This does not allow an attacker to forge certificates, and does not affect certificate verification or OpenSSL servers/clients in any other way. It also does not affect common revocation mechanisms. Only custom applications that rely on the uniqueness of the fingerprint (e.g. certificate blacklists) may be affected.

Bignum squaring (BN\_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, including x86\_64. This bug occurs at random with a very low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been determined: \*) The probability of BN\_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. \*) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. \*) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected. \*) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.

Fix a denial of service flaw in the DTLS implementation. In dtls1\_process\_out\_of\_seq\_message() the check if the current message is already buffered was missing. For every new message was memory allocated, allowing an attacker to perform an denial of service attack against a DTLS server by sending out of seq handshake messages until there is no memory left.

The Google Security Team discovered several functions inside OpenSSL incorrectly checked the result after calling the EVP\_VerifyFinal function, allowing a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature rather than as an error. This issue affected the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS. One way to exploit this flaw would be for a remote attacker who is in control of a malicious server or who can use a âman in the middleâ attack to present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

ABSTRACT
TLS and SSH are two of the most commonly used proto-
cols for securing Internet traﬃc. Many of the implemen-
tations of these protocols rely on the cryptographic primi-
tives provided in the OpenSSL library. In this work we dis-
close a vulnerability in OpenSSL, aﬀecting all versions and
forks (e.g. LibreSSL and BoringSSL) since roughly October
2005, which renders the implementation of the DSA signa-
ture scheme vulnerable to cache-based side-channel attacks.
Exploiting the software defect, we demonstrate the ﬁrst pub-
lished cache-based key-recovery attack on these protocols:
260 SSH-2 handshakes to extract a 1024/160-bit DSA host
key from an OpenSSH server, and 580 TLS 1.2 handshakes
to extract a 2048/256-bit DSA key from an stunnel server.

ysis; timing attacks; cache-timing attacks; DSA; OpenSSL;

INTRODUCTION

One of the contributing factors to the explosion of the
Internet in the last decade is the security provided by the
underlying cryptographic protocols. Two of those protocols
are the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which pro-
vides security to network communication and the more spe-
cialized Secure Shell (SSH), which provides secure login to
remote hosts.

Software implementations of these protocols often use the
cryptographic primitives’ implementations of the OpenSSL
cryptographic library. Consequently, the security of these
implementations depends on the security of OpenSSL.

In this paper we present a novel side-channel cache-timing
attack against OpenSSL’s DSA implementation. The attack
exploits a vulnerability in OpenSSL, which fails to use a side-
channel-secure implementation of modular exponentiation
— the core mathematical operation used in DSA signatures.

Our attack builds upon several techniques to proﬁle the
cache memory and capture timing signals. The signals are
processed and converted into a sequence of square and mul-
tiplication (SM) operations from which we extract informa-
tion to create a lattice problem. The solution to the lattice
problem yields the secret key of digital signatures.

Flush+Reload [40] is a powerful technique to perform
cache-timing attacks. We adapt the Flush+Reload tech-
nique to OpenSSL’s implementation of DSA and, exploit-
ing properties of the Intel implementation of the x86 and
x64 processor architectures, our spy program probes rele-
vant memory addresses to create a signal trace.

We process the captured signal to get the SM sequence
performed by the sliding window exponentiation (SWE) al-
gorithm. Then we observe and analyze the number of bits
that can be extracted and used from each of those sequences.
Later, the variable amount of bits extracted from each trace
is used as input to a lattice attack that recovers the private
key.

To bridge the gap between the limited resolution of the
Flush+Reload technique [4] and the high-performance of
the OpenSSL code we apply the performance-degradation
technique of Allan et al. [4]. This technique slows the expo-
nentiation by an average factor of 20, giving a high resolution
trace and allowing us to extract up to 8 bits of information
from some of the traces.

Similar to previous works [9, 14, 21, 32], we perform a
lattice attack to recover the secret key. We use the lattice
construction of Benger et al. [9] and solve the resulting lat-
tice problem using the lattice reduction technique of Nguyen
and Shparlinski [28].

A unique feature of our work is that we target common
cryptographic protocols. Previous works that demonstrate
cache-timing key-recovery attacks only target the crypto-
graphic primitives, ignoring potential cache noise from the
protocol implementation.
In contrast, we present end-to-
end attacks on two common cryptographic protocols: SSH
and TLS. We are, therefore, the ﬁrst to demonstrate that
cache-timing attacks are a threat not only when executing
the cryptographic primitives but also in the presence of the
cache activity of the whole protocol suite.

Our contributions in this work are the following:

• We identify a security weakness in OpenSSL which
fails to use a side-channel safe implementation when
performing DSA signatures. (Section 3)

• We describe how to use a combination of the Flush+

Reload technique with a performance-degradation at-
tack to leak information from the unsafe SWE algo-
rithm. (Section 4)

• We present the ﬁrst key-recovery cache-timing attack
on the TLS and SSH cryptographic protocols. (Sec-
tion 5)

• We construct and solve a lattice problem with the side-
channel information and the digital signatures in order
to recover the secret key. (Section 6)

2. BACKGROUND

2.1 Memory Hierarchy

Accessing data and instructions from main memory is a
time consuming operation which delays the work of the fast
processors, for that reason the memory hierarchy includes
smaller and faster memories called caches. Caches improve
the performance by exploiting the spatial and temporal lo-
cality of the memory access.

In modern processors the hierarchy of caches is structured
as follows, higher-level caches, located closer to the processor
core, are smaller and faster than low-level caches, which are
located closer to main memory. Recent Intel architecture
typically has three levels of cache: L1, L2 and Last-Level
Cache (LLC).

Each core has two L1 caches, a data cache and an instruc-
tion cache, each 32 KiB in size with an access time of 4
cycles. L2 caches are also core-private and have an inter-
mediate size (256 KiB) and latency (7 cycles). The LLC is
shared among all of the cores and is a uniﬁed cache, con-
taining both data and instructions. Typical LLC sizes are
in megabytes and access time is in the order of 40 cycles.

The unit of memory and allocation in a cache is called
cache line. Cache lines are of a ﬁxed size B, which is typ-
ically 64 bytes. The lg(B) low-order bits of the address,
called line oﬀset, are used to locate the datum in the cache
line.

When a memory address is accessed, the processor checks
the availability of the address line in the top-level L1 cache.
If the data is there then it is served to the processor, a
situation referred to as a cache hit. In a cache miss, when
the data is not found in the L1 cache, the processor repeats
the search for the line in the next cache level and continues
through all the caches. Once the line is found, the processor
stores a copy in the cache for future use.

Most caches are set-associative. They are composed of S
cache sets each containing a ﬁxed number of cache lines. The
number of cache lines in a set is the cache associativity, i.e.,
a cache with W lines in each set is a W -way set-associative
cache.

Since the main memory is orders of magnitude larger than
the cache, more than W memory lines may map to the same
cache set. If a cache miss occurs and all the cache lines in
the matching cache set are in use, one of the cached lines
is evicted, freeing a slot for a new line to be fetched from
a lower-level memory. Several cache replacement policies
exist to determine the cache line to evict when a cache miss
occurs but the typical policy in use is an approximation to
the least-recently-used (LRU).

The last-level cache in modern Intel processors is inclusive.
Inclusive caches contain a superset of the contents of the

cache levels above them.
In the case of Intel processors,
the contents of the L1 and L2 caches is also stored in the
last-level cache. A consequence of the inclusion property is
that when data is evicted from the last-level cache it is also
evicted from all of the other levels of cache in the processor.
Intel architecture implements several cache optimizations.
The spatial pre-fetcher pairs cache lines and attempt to fetch
the pair of a missed line [17]. Consecutive accesses to mem-
ory addresses are detected and pre-fetched when the pro-
cessor anticipates they may be required [17]. Additionally,
when the processor is presented with a conditional branch,
speculative execution brings the data of both branches into
the cache before the branch condition is evaluated [35].

Page [30] noted that tracing the sequence of cache hits
and misses of software may leak information on the internal
working of the software, including information that may lead
to recovering cryptographic keys.

This idea was later extended and used for mounting sev-
eral cache-based side-channel attacks [10, 29, 31]. Other
attacks were shown against the L1-instruction cache [3], the
branch prediction buﬀer [1, 2] and the last-level cache [20,
22, 25, 40].

2.2 The Flush+Reload Attack

Our LLC-based attack is based on the Flush+Reload [20,
40] attack, which is a cache-based side-channel attack tech-
nique.

Unlike the earlier Prime+Probe technique [29, 31] that
detects activity in cache sets, the Flush+Reload technique
identiﬁes access to memory lines, giving it a higher resolu-
tion, a high accuracy and high signal-to-noise ratio.

Like Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload relies on cache shar-
ing between processes. Additionally, it requires data shar-
ing, which is typically achieved through the use of shared
libraries or using page de-duplication [6, 36].

A round of the attack, which identiﬁes victim access to
a shared memory line, consists of three phases. (See Algo-
rithm 1.) In the ﬁrst phase the adversary evicts the mon-
itored memory line from the cache.
In the second phase,
the adversary waits a period of time so the victim has an
opportunity to access the memory line. In the third phase,
the adversary measures the time it takes to reload the mem-
ory line. If during the second phase the victim accesses the
memory line, the line will be available in the cache and the
reload operation in the third phase will take a short time. If,
on the other hand, the victim does not access the memory
line then the third phase takes a longer time as the memory
line is loaded from main memory.

Algorithm 1: Flush+Reload Attack
Input: Memory Address addr.
Result: True if the victim accessed the address.

begin

flush(addr )
Wait for the victim.
time ← current_time()
tmp ← read(addr )
readTime ← current_time() - time
return readTime < threshold

The execution of the victim and the adversary processes
are independent of each other, thus synchronization of prob-

ing is important and several factors need to be considered
when processing the side-channel data. Some of those fac-
tors are the waiting period for the adversary between probes,
memory lines to be probed, size of the side-channel trace and
cache-hit threshold. One important goal for this attack is to
achieve the best resolution possible while keeping the error
rate low and one of the ways to achieve this is by targeting
memory lines that occur frequently during execution, such
as loop bodies. Several processor optimizations are in place
during a typical process execution and an attacker must be
aware of these optimizations to ﬁlter them during the anal-
ysis of the attack results. See [4, 39, 40] for discussions of
some of these parameters.

A typical implementation of the Flush+Reload attack
makes use of the clflush instruction of the x86 and x64
instruction sets. The clflush instruction evicts a speciﬁc
memory line from all the cache hierarchy and being an un-
privileged instruction, it can be used by any process.

The inclusiveness of the LLC is essential for the Flush+
Reload attack. Whenever a memory line is evicted from
the LLC, the processor also evicts the line from all of the L1
and L2 caches. On processors that do not have an inclusive
LLC, e.g., AMD processors, the attack does not work [40].
See, however, Lipp et al. [24] for a variant of the technique
that does not require an inclusive LLC.

2.3 The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)

A variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, DSA was ﬁrst
proposed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST). DSA uses the multiplicative group of a
ﬁnite ﬁeld. We use the following notation for DSA.
Parameters: Primes p, q such that q divides (p − 1), a gen-
erator g of multiplicative order q in GF (p) and an approved
hash function h (e.g. SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512).
Private-Public key pairs: The private key α is an integer
uniformly chosen such that 0 < α < q and the corresponding
public key y is given by y = gα mod p. Calculating the
private key given the public key requires solving the discrete
logarithm problem and for correctly chosen parameters, this
is an intractable problem.
Signing: A given party, Alice, wants to send a signed mes-
sage m to Bob—the message m is not necessarily encrypted.
Using her private-public key pair (αA, yA), Alice performs
the following steps:

1. Select uniformly at random a secret nonce k such that

0 < k < q.

2. Compute r = (gk mod p) mod q and h(m).

3. Compute s = k−1(h(m) + αAr) mod q.

4. Alice sends (m, r, s) to Bob.

Verifying: Bob wants to be sure the message he received
comes from Alice—a valid DSA signature gives strong evi-
dence of authenticity. Bob performs the following steps to
verify the signature:

1. Reject the signature if it does not satisfy 0 < r < q

and 0 < s < q.

2. Compute w = s−1 mod q and h(m).

3. Compute u1 = h(m)w mod q and u2 = rw mod q.

4. Compute v = (gu1 yu2

A mod p) mod q.

5. Accept the signature if and only if v = r holds.

2.3.1 DSA in Practice

Putting it mildly, there is no consensus on key sizes, and
furthermore keys seen in the wild and used in ubiquitous
protocols have varying sizes—sometimes dictated by existing
and deployed standards. For example, NIST deﬁnes 1024-bit
p with 160-bit q as “legacy-use” and 2048-bit p with 256-bit
q as “acceptable” [8]. We focus on these two parameter sets.
SSH’s Transport Layer Protocol1 lists DSA key type ssh-
dss as “required” and deﬁnes r and s as 160-bit integers,
implying 160-bit q. In fact the OpenSSH tool ssh-keygen
defaults to 160-bit q and 1024-bit p for these key types, not
allowing the user to override that option, and using the same
It is worth
parameters to generate the server’s host key.
noting that recently as of version 7.0, OpenSSH disables
host server DSA keys by a conﬁgurable default option2, but
of course this does not aﬀect already deployed solutions.

As a countermeasure to previous timing attacks, Open-
SSL’s DSA implementation pads nonces by adding either q
or 2q to k—see details in Section 3.

For the DSA signing algorithm, Step 2 is the performance
bottleneck and the exponentiation algorithm used will prove
to be of extreme importance when we later collect our side-
channel information in Section 4.

2.4 Sliding Window Exponentiation

Sliding window exponentiation (SWE) is a widely imple-
mented software method to perform integer exponentiations,
e.g. featured alongside other methods in the OpenSSL code-
base. SWE is fairly popular due to its performance since it
reduces the amount of pre-computation needed and, more-
over, reduces the average amount of multiplications per-
formed during the exponentiation.

An exponent e is represented and processed as a sequence
of windows ei, each of length L(ei) bits. Processing the
exponent in windows reduces the amount of multiplications
at the cost of increased memory utilization since a table of
pre-computed values is used.

A window ei can be a zero window represented as a string
of “0”s or non-zero window represented as a string starting
and ending with “1”s and such window is of width w (de-
termined in OpenSSL by the size in bits of the exponent e).
The length of non-zero windows satisfy 1 ≤ L(ei) ≤ w, thus
the value of any given non-zero window is an odd number
between 1 and 2w − 1.

As mentioned before, the algorithm pre-computes values
and stores them in a table to be used later during multipli-
cation operations. The multipliers computed are bv mod m
for each odd value of v where 1 ≤ v ≤ 2w − 1 and these
values are stored in table index g[i] where i = (v − 1)/2. For
example, with the standard 160-bit q size, OpenSSL uses a
window width w = 4, the algorithm pre-computes multipli-
ers b1, b3, b5, ..., b15 mod m and stores them in g[0], g[1], g[2],
..., g[7], respectively.

Using the SWE representation of the exponent e, Algo-
rithm 2 computes the corresponding exponentiation through
a combination of squares and multiplications in a left-to-
right approach. The algorithm scans every window ei from

Input: Window size w, base b, modulo m, N-bit

length L(ei).
Output: be mod m.

if ei (cid:54)= 0 then r ←MULT(r, g[(ei − 1)/2]) mod m;

return r;

the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) to the least signiﬁcant bit
(LSB).

For any window, a square operation is executed for each
bit and additionally for a non-zero window, the algorithm
executes an extra multiplication when it reaches the LSB of
the window.

For novel reasons explained later in Section 3, the side-
channel part of our attack focuses on this algorithm. Specif-
ically, in getting the sequence of squares and multiplies per-
formed during its execution. Then we extract partial infor-
mation from the sequence for later use in the lattice attack.

2.5 Partial key disclosure

Recall that the nonce k and the secret key α satisfy the

following linear congruence.

s = k−1(h(m) + αr) mod q

The constants of the linear combination are speciﬁed by
s, h(m), and r, which, typically for a signed message, are all
public. Hence, knowing the nonce k reveals the secret key
α.

Typically, side-channel leakage from SWE only recovers
partial information about the nonce. The adversary, there-
fore, has to use that partial information to recover the key.
The usual technique for recovering the secret key from the
partial information is to express the problem as a hidden
number problem [12] which is solved using a lattice tech-
nique.

2.5.1 The hidden number problem

In the hidden number problem (HNP) the task is to ﬁnd a
hidden number given some of the MSBs of several modular
linear combinations of the hidden number. More speciﬁcally,
the problem is to ﬁnd a secret number α given a number of
triples (ti, ui, (cid:96)i) such that for vi = |α · ti − ui|q we have
|vi| ≤ q/2(cid:96)i+1, where | · |q is the reduction modulo q into the
range (−q/2, . . . , q/2).

Boneh and Venkatesan [12] initially investigate HNP with
a constant (cid:96)i = (cid:96). They show that for (cid:96) < log1/2 q + log log q
and random ti, the hidden number α can be recovered given
a number of triples linear in log q.

Howgrave-Graham and Smart [21] extend the work of

Boneh and Venkatesan [12] showing how to construct an
HNP instance from leaked LSBs and MSBs of DSA nonces.
Nguyen and Shparlinski [27] prove that for a good enough
hash function and for a linear number of randomly chosen
nonces, knowing the (cid:96) LSBs of a certain number of nonces,
the (cid:96) + 1 MSBs or 2 · (cid:96) consecutive bits anywhere in the
nonces is enough for recovering the long term key α. They
further demonstrate that a DSA-160 key can be broken if
only the 3 LSBs of a certain number of nonces are known.
Nguyen and Shparlinski [28] extend the results to ECDSA,
and Liu and Nguyen [26] demonstrate that only 2 LSBs are
required for breaking a DSA-160 key. Benger et al. [9] ex-
tend the technique to use a diﬀerent number of leaked LSBs
for each signature.

2.5.2 Lattice attack

To ﬁnd the hidden number from the triples we solve a
lattice problem. The construction of the lattice problem
presented here is due to Benger et al. [9], and is based on
the constructions in earlier publications [12, 27].

Given d triples, we construct a d + 1-dimensional lattice

using the rows of the matrix








B =

2(cid:96)1+1 · q

2(cid:96)1+1 · t1

. . .

. . .

2(cid:96)d+1 · q
2(cid:96)d+1 · td








.

1

By the deﬁnition of vi, there are integers λi such that
vi = λi · q + α · ti − ui. Consequently, for the vectors x =
(λ1, . . . , λd, α), y = (2(cid:96)1+1 · v1, . . . , 2(cid:96)d+1 · vd, α) and u =
(2(cid:96)1+1 · u1, . . . , 2(cid:96)d+1 · ud, 0) we have

x · B − u = y.

√

The 2-norm of the vector y is about

d + 1 · q whereas
the determinant of the lattice L(B) is 2d+(cid:80) li · qd. Hence y
is a short vector in the lattice and the vector u is close to
the lattice vector x · B. We can now solve the Closest Vector
Problem (CVP) with inputs B and u to ﬁnd x, revealing the
value of the hidden number α.

2.5.3 Related Work

Several authors describe attacks on cryptographic systems
that exploit partial nonce disclosure to recover long-term
private keys.

Brumley and Hakala [14] use an L1 data cache-timing at-
tack to recover the LSBs of ECDSA nonces from the dgst
command line tool in OpenSSL 0.9.8k. They collect 2,600
signatures (8K with noise) and use the Howgrave-Graham
and Smart [21] attack to recover a 160-bit ECDSA private
key. In a similar vein, Acıi¸cmez et al. [3] use an L1 instruc-
tion cache-timing attack to recover the LSBs of DSA nonces
from the same tool in OpenSSL 0.9.8l, requiring 2,400 sig-
natures (17K with noise) to recover a 160-bit DSA private
key. Both attacks require HyperThreading architectures.

Brumley and Tuveri [15] mount a remote timing attack on
the implementation of ECDSA with binary curves in Open-
SSL 0.9.8o. They show that the timing leaks information on
the MSBs of the nonce used and that after collecting that
information over 8,000 TLS handshakes the private key can
be recovered.

Benger et al. [9] recover the secret key of OpenSSL’s EC-
DSA implementation for the curve secp256k1 using less than

256 signatures. They use the Flush+Reload technique to
ﬁnd some LSBs of the nonces and extend the lattice tech-
nique of Howgrave-Graham and Smart [21] to use all of the
leaked bits rather than limiting to a ﬁxed number.

Van de Pol et al. [32] exploit the structure of the modulus
in some elliptic curves to use all of the information leaked
in consecutive sequences of bits anywhere in the top half of
the nonces, allowing them to recover the secret key after ob-
serving only a handful of signatures. Allan et al. [4] improve
on these results by using a performance-degradation attack
to amplify the side-channel. The ampliﬁcation allows them
to observe the sign bit in the wNAF representation used in
OpenSSL 1.0.2a and to recover a 256 bit key after observing
only 6 signatures.

Genkin et al. [19] perform electromagnetic and power anal-
ysis attacks on mobile phones. They show how to construct
HNP triples when the signature uses the low s-value [38].

3. A NEW SOFTWARE DEFECT

Percival [31] demonstrated that the SWE implementation
of modular exponentiation in OpenSSL version 0.9.7g is vul-
nerable to cache-timing attacks, applied to recover RSA pri-
vate keys. Following the issue, the OpenSSL team com-
mitted two code changes relevant to this work. The ﬁrst3
adds a “constant-time” implementation of modular exponen-
tiation, with a ﬁxed-window implementation and using the
scatter-gather method [13, 41] of masking table access to the
multipliers.

The new implementation is slower than the original SWE
implementation. To avoid using the slower new code when
the exponent is not secret, OpenSSL added a ﬂag (BN_FLG_-
CONSTTIME) to its representation of big integers. When the
exponent should remain secret (e.g. in decryption and sign-
ing) the ﬂag is set (e.g. in the case of DSA nonces, Figure 1,
Line 252) at runtime and the exponentiation code takes the
“constant-time” execution path (Figure 2, Line 413). Oth-
erwise, the original SWE implementation is used.

The execution time of the “constant-time” implementation
still depends on the bit length of the exponent, which in the
case of DSA should be kept secret [12, 15, 27]. The second
commit4 aims to “make sure DSA signing exponentiations
really are constant-time” by ensuring that the bit length of
the exponent is ﬁxed. This safe default behavior can be dis-
abled by applications enabling the DSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CON-
STTIME ﬂag at runtime within the DSA structure, although
we are not aware of any such cases.

To get a ﬁxed bit length, the DSA implementation adds γq
to the randomly chosen nonce, where γ ∈ {1, 2}, such that
the bit length of the sum is one more than the bit length of
q. More precisely, the implementation creates a copy of the
nonce k (Figure 1, Line 264), adds q to it (Line 274), checks
if the bit length of the sum is one more than that of q (Line
276), otherwise it adds q again to the sum (Line 277). If q
is n bits, then k + q is either n or n + 1 bits. In the former
case, indeed k + 2q is n + 1 bits. As an aside, we note the
code in question is not constant-time and potentially leaks
the value of γ. Such a leak would create a bias that can be
exploited to mount the Bleichenbacher attack [5, 11, 18].

0ebfcc8f92736c900bae4066040b67f6e5db8edb

While the procedure in this commit ensures that the bit
length of the sum kq is ﬁxed, unfortunately it introduces a
software defect. The function BN_copy is not designed to
propagate ﬂags from the source to the destination. In fact,
OpenSSL exposes a distinct API BN_with_flags for that
functionality—quoting the documentation:

BN_with_flags creates a temporary shallow copy
of b in dest . . . Any ﬂags provided in flags will
be set in dest in addition to any ﬂags already set
in b. For example this might commonly be used
to create a temporary copy of a BIGNUM with
the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME ﬂag set for constant time
operations.

In contrast, with BN_copy the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME ﬂag does
not propagate to kq. Consequently, the sum is not treated
as secret, reverting the change made in the ﬁrst commit—
when the exponentiation wrapper subsequently gets called
(Figure 1, Line 285), it fails the security-critical branch. Fol-
lowing a debug session in Figure 2, indeed the ﬂag (explicit
value 0x4) is not set, and the execution skips the call to BN_-
mod_exp_mont_consttime and instead continues with the in-
secure SWE code path for DSA exponentiation.

In addition to testing our attack against OpenSSL (1.0.2h),
we reviewed the code of two popular OpenSSL forks: Li-
breSSL5 and BoringSSL6. Using builds with debugging sym-
bols, we conﬁrm both LibreSSL7 and BoringSSL8 share the
same defect. It is worth noting that BoringSSL stripped out
TLS DSA cipher suites in late 20149.

4. EXPLOITING THE DEFECT

In this section we describe how we use and combine the
Flush+Reload technique with a performance degradation
technique [4] to attack the OpenSSL implementation of DSA.
We tested our attack on an Intel Core i5-4570 Haswell
Quad-Core 3.2GHz (22nm) with 16GB of memory running
64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS “Trusty”. Each core has an 8-way
32KB L1 data cache, an 8-way 32KB L1 instruction cache,
an 8-way 256KB L2 uniﬁed cache, and all the cores share a
12-way 6MB uniﬁed LLC (all with 64B lines). It does not
feature HyperThreading.

We used our own build of OpenSSL 1.0.2h which is the
same default build of OpenSSL but with debugging symbols
on the executable. Debugging symbols facilitate mapping
source code to memory addresses but they are not loaded
during run time, thus the victim’s performance is not af-
fected. Debugging symbols are, typically, not available to
attackers but using reverse engineering techniques [16] is
possible to map source code to memory addresses.

As previously discussed in Section 2.5, for DSA-type sig-
natures, knowing a few bits of suﬃciently many signature
nonces allows an attacker to recover the secret key. This
is the goal of our attack: we trace and recover side-channel
information of the SWE algorithm that reveals the sequence

Figure 2: Debugging OpenSSL DSA signing in
crypto/bn/bn_exp.c. The Line 413 branch is not
taken since BN_FLG_CONSTTIME is not set, as seen from
the print command outputs. Hence BN_mod_exp_-
mont_consttime is not called— the control ﬂow con-
tinues with classical SWE code.

of squares and multiplications, from that sequence we re-
cover a few bits that we use for the lattice attack described
in Section 6.

As seen in Figure 2, every time OpenSSL performs a DSA
signature, the exponentiation method BN_mod_exp_mont in
crypto/bn/bn_exp.c gets called. There, the BN_FLG_CONST-
TIME ﬂag is checked but due to the software defect discussed
in Section 3 the condition fails and the routine continues
with the SWE pre-computation and then the actual expo-
nentiation. For the ﬁnite ﬁeld operations, BN_mod_exp_mont
calls BN_mod_mul_montgomery in crypto/bn/bn_mont.c and
from there, the multiply wrapper bn_mul_mont is called,
where, by default for x64 targets, assembly code is executed
to perform low level operations using BIGNUMs for square
and multiplication. OpenSSL uses Montgomery represen-
tation for eﬃciency. Note that for other platforms and/or
non-default build conﬁgurations, the actual code executed
ranges from pure C implementation to entirely diﬀerent as-
sembly. The attacker can easily adapt to these diﬀerent
execution paths, but the discussion that follows is geared
towards our target platform.

The threshold set for the load time in the Flush+Reload
technique (cache hit vs. cache miss) is system and software
dependent. From our measurements we set this threshold
accordingly since the load times from LLC and from memory
were clearly deﬁned. Figure 4 shows that loads from LLC
take less that 100 cycles, while loads from main memory
take more than 200 cycles.

As mentioned before, to get better resolution and gran-
ularity during the attack one eﬀective strategy is to tar-
get body loops or routines that are invoked several times.
For that reason we probe, using the Flush+Reload tech-
nique, inner routines used for square and multiply. Since
squares can be computed more eﬃciently than multiplica-
tion, OpenSSL’s multiply wrapper checks if the two pointer
operands are the same and, if so, calls to assembly squar-
ing code (bn_sqr8x_mont)—otherwise, to assembly multiply
code (bn_mul4x_mont).

At the same time we run a performance degradation at-
tack, ﬂushing actively used memory addresses during these
routines (e.g. assembly labels Lsqr4x_inner and Linner4x,
respectively). We slow down the execution time to a safe,
but not noticeable by the victim, threshold that ensures a
good trace by our spy program. In our experiments, we ob-
serve slow down factors of roughly 16 and 26 for 1024-bit and
2048-bit DSA, respectively due to the degrade technique.

Using this strategy, our spy program collects data from
two channels: one for square latencies and the other for
multiply latencies. We then apply signal processing tech-
niques to this raw channel data. A moving average ﬁlter on
the data results in Figure 3 and Figure 4 for 1024-bit and
2048-bit DSA, respectively. There is a signiﬁcant amount
of information to extract from these signals on the SWE
algorithm state transitions and hence exponent bit values.
Generally, extracted multiplications yield a single bit of in-
formation and the squares yield the position for these bits.
Some short examples follow.

Stepping through Figure 3, the initial low amplitude for
the multiply signal is the multiplication for converting the
base operand to Montgomery representation. The subse-
quent low amplitude for the square signal is the temporary
square value used to build the odd powers for the SWE pre-
computation table (i.e. s in Algorithm 2). The subsequent

long period of low multiply amplitude is the successive mul-
tiplications to build the pre-computation table itself. Then
begins the main loop of SWE. As an upward sloping multiply
amplitude intersects a downward sloping square amplitude,
this marks the transition from a multiplication operation to
a square operation (and vice versa). This naturally occurs
several times as the main exponentiation loop iterates. The
end of this particular signal shows a ﬁnal transition from
multiply to a single square, indicating that the exponent is
even and the two LSBs are 1 and 0.

Stepping through Figure 4 is similar, yet the end of this
particular signal shows a ﬁnal transition from square to
multiply—indicating that the exponent is odd, i.e. the LSB
is 1.

Even when employing the degrade technique, it is impor-
tant to observe the vast granularity diﬀerence between these
two cryptographic settings. On average, a 2048-bit signal is
roughly ten times the length of a 1024-bit signal, even when
the exponent is only 60% longer (i.e. 256-bit vs. 160-bit).
This generally suggests we should be able to extract more
accurate information from 2048-bit signals than 1024-bit—
i.e., the higher security cryptographic parameters are more
vulnerable to side-channel attack in this case. See [37, 39, 40]
for similar examples of this phenomenon.

Granularity is vital to determining the number of squares
interleaved between multiplications. Since, in our environ-
ment, there appears to be no reliable indicator in the signal
for transitions from one square to the next, we estimate the
number of adjacent squares by the horizontal distance be-
tween multiplications. Since the channel is latency data, we
also have reference clock cycle counter values so another es-
timate is based on the counter diﬀerences at these points.
Our experiments showed no signiﬁcant advantage of one ap-
proach over the other.

Extracting the multiplications from the signal and inter-
leaving them with a number of consecutive squares propor-
tional to the width of the corresponding gap gives us the
square and multiplication sequence, or SM sequence, that
the SWE algorithm passed through. Figure 7 shows an ex-
ample of an SM sequence recorded by the spy program when
OpenSSL signs using 2048-bit DSA.

Our spy program is able to capture most of the SM se-
quence accurately. It can miss or duplicate a few squares
due to drift but is able to capture all of the multiplication
operations. Closer to the LSBs, the information extracted
from the SM sequence is more reliable since the bit position
is lost if any square operation is missed during probing.

5. VICTIMIZING APPLICATIONS

The defect from the previous section is in a shared library.
Potentially any application that links against OpenSSL for
DSA functionality can be aﬀected by this vulnerability. But
to make our attack concrete, we focus on two ubiquitous
protocols and applications: TLS within stunnel and SSH
within OpenSSH.

As we discuss later in Section 6, the trace data alone is
not enough for private key recovery—we also need the digital
signatures themselves and (hashed) messages. To this end,
the goal of this section is to describe the practical tooling
we developed to exploit the defect within these applications,
collecting both trace data and protocol messages.

5.1 Attacking TLS

To feature TLS support, one option for network applica-
tions that do not natively support TLS communication is
to use stunnel10, a popular portable open source software
package that forwards network connections from one port
to another and provides a TLS wrapper. A typical stun-
nel use case is listening on a public port to expose a TLS-
enabled network service, then connecting to a localhost port
where a non-TLS network service is listening—stunnel pro-
vides a TLS layer between the two ports. It links against
the OpenSSL shared library to provide this functionality.
For our experiments, we used stunnel 5.32 compiled from
stock source and linked against OpenSSL 1.0.2h. We gener-
ated a 2048-bit DSA certiﬁcate for the stunnel service and
chose the DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256 TLS 1.2 cipher suite.

We wrote a custom TLS client that connects to this stun-
nel service. It launches our spy to collect the timing signals,
but its main purpose is to carry out the TLS handshake and
collect the digital signatures and protocol messages. Fig-
ure 5 shows the TLS handshake. Relevant to this work, the
initial ClientHello message contains a 32-byte random ﬁeld,
and similarly the server’s ServerHello message. In practice,
these are usually a 4-byte UNIX timestamp concatenated
with a 28-byte nonce. The Certificate message contains
the DSA certiﬁcate we generated for the stunnel service. The
ServerKeyExchange message contains a number of critical
ﬁelds for our attack: Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange parame-
ters, the signature algorithm and hash function identiﬁers,
and ﬁnally the digital signature itself in the signed_params
ﬁeld. Given our stunnel conﬁguration and certiﬁcate, the
2048-bit DSA signature is over the concatenated string

ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random +
ServerKeyExchange.params

and the hash function is SHA-512, both dictated by the
SignatureAndHashAlgorithm ﬁeld (explicit values 0x6, 0x2).
Our client saves the hash of this string and the DER-encoded
digital signature sent from the server. All subsequent mes-
sages, including ServerHelloDone and any client responses,
are not required by our attack. Our client therefore drops
the connection at this stage, and repeats this process sev-
eral hundred times to build up a set of distinct trace, digital
signature, and digest tuples. See Section 6 for our explicit
attack parameters. Figure 4 is a typical signal extracted by
our spy program in parallel to the handshake between our
client and the victim stunnel service.

5.2 Attacking SSH

OpenSSH11 is a suite of tools whose main goal is to provide
secure communications over an insecure channel using the
SSH network protocol.

OpenSSH is linked to the OpenSSL shared library to per-
form several cryptographic operations, including digital sig-
natures (excluding ed25519 signatures). For our experi-
ments we used the stock OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 binary pack-
age from the Ubuntu repository, and pointed the run-time
shared library loader at OpenSSL 1.0.2h. The DSA key pair
used by the server and targeted by our attack is the default
1024-bit key pair generated during installation of OpenSSH.
Similar to Section 5.1, we wrote a custom SSH client that

launches our spy program, the spy program collects the tim-
ing signals during the handshake. At the same time it per-
forms an SSH handshake where the protocol messages and
the digital signature are collected for our attack.

Relevant to this work, the SSH protocol deﬁnes the Diﬃe-
Hellman key exchange parameters in the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT
message, along with the signature algorithm and the hash
function identiﬁers. Additionally a 16-byte random nonce is
sent for host authentication by the client and the server.

The SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY message contains the server’s
public key (used to create and verify the signature), server’s
DH public key f (used to compute the shared secret K in
combination with the client’s DH public key e) and the sig-
nature itself. Figure 6 shows the SSH handshake with the
critical parameters sent in every message relevant for the
attack. To be more precise, the signature is over the SHA-1
hash of the concatenated string

ClientVersion + ServerVersion +
Client.SSH_MSG_KEXINIT + Server.SSH_MSG_KEXINIT +
Server.publicKey + minSize + prefSize + maxSize +
p + g + e + f + K

As the key exchange12 and public key parameters, our
SSH client was conﬁgured to use diffie-hellman-group-
-exchange-sha1 and ssh-dss respectively. Note that two
diﬀerent hashing functions may be used, one hash function
for key derivation following Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange and
another hash function for the signing algorithm, which for
DSA is the SHA-1 hash function.

Similarly to the TLS case, our client saves the hash of
the concatenated string and the digital signature raw bytes
sent from the server. All subsequent messages, including
SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS and any client responses, are not required
by our attack. Our client therefore drops the connection at
this stage, and repeats this process several hundred times to

12https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4419

build up a set of distinct trace, digital signature, and digest
tuples. See Section 6 for our explicit attack parameters.
Figure 3 is a typical signal extracted by our spy program in
parallel to the handshake between our client and the victim
SSH server.

5.3 Observations

These two widely deployed protocols share many similar-
ities in their handshakes regarding e.g. signaling, content of
messages, and security context of messages. However, in the
process of designing and implementing our attacker clients
we observe a subtle diﬀerence in the threat model between
the two. In TLS, all values that go into the hash function to
compute the digital signature are public and can be observed
(unencrypted) in various handshake messages. In SSH, most
of the values are public—the exception is the last input to
the hash function: the shared DH key. The consequence
is side-channel attacks against TLS can be passive, listen-
ing to legitimate handshakes not initiated by the attacker
yet collecting side-channel data as this occurs. In SSH, the
attacker must be active and initiate its own handshakes—
without knowing the shared DH key, a passive attacker can-
not compute the corresponding digest needed later for the
lattice stage of the attack. We ﬁnd this innate protocol
level side-channel property to be an intriguing feature, and
a factor that should be carefully considered during protocol
design.

6. RECOVERING THE PRIVATE KEY

In previous sections we showed how our attack can re-
cover the sequence of square and multiply operations that
the victim performs. We further showed how to get the sig-
nature information matching each sequence for both SSH
and TLS. We now turn to recovering the private key from
the information we collect.

The scheme we use is similar to past works. We ﬁrst

use the side-channel information we capture to collect in-
formation on the nonce used in each signature. We use the
information to construct HNP instances and use a lattice
technique to ﬁnd the private key. Further details on each
step are provided below.

6.1 Extracting the least signiﬁcant bits

In Section 4 we showed how we collect the SM sequences
of each exponentiation. From every SM sequence, we extract
a few LSBs to be used later in the lattice attack. To that
end, Table 1 contains our empirical accuracy statistics for
various relevant patterns trailing the SM sequences, and fur-
thermore not for the SWE in isolation but rather in the con-
text of OpenSSL DSA executing in real world applications
(TLS via stunnel, SSH via OpenSSH), as described above
in Section 5. All of these patterns correspond to recovering
a = ¯k mod 2(cid:96) for an exponent ¯k. From these ﬁgures, we
note two trends. (1) The accuracy decreases as (cid:96) increases
due to deviation in the square operation width. Yet weighed
with the exponentially decreasing probability of the longer
patterns, the practical impact diminishes. (2) As expected,
we generally obtain more accurate results with 2048-bit vs.
1024-bit due to granularity. These numbers show that, ex-
ploiting our new software defect and leveraging the tech-
niques in Section 4, we can recover a with extremely high
probability.

6.2 Lattice attack implementation

Recall that to protect against timing attacks OpenSSL
uses an exponent ¯k equivalent to the randomly selected nonce
k. ¯k is calculated by adding the modulus q once or twice to
k to ensure that ¯k is of a ﬁxed length. That is, ¯k = k + γq
such that 2n ≤ ¯k < 2n + q where n = (cid:100)lg(q)(cid:101) and γ ∈ {1, 2}.
The side-channel leaks information on bits of the expo-
nent ¯k rather than directly on the nonce. To create HNP
instances from the leak we need to handle the unknown value
of γ. In previous works, due to ECC parameters the modu-
lus is close to a power of two hence the value of γ is virtually
constant [9]. For DSA, the modulus is not close to a power
of two and the value of γ varies between signatures. The
challenge is, therefore, to construct an HNP instance with-
out the knowledge of γ. We now show how to address this
challenge.

Recall that s = k−1(h(m) + αr) mod q. Equivalently,
k = s−1(h(m) + αr) mod q. The side-channel information
recovers the (cid:96) LSBs of ¯k. We, therefore, have ¯k = b2(cid:96) + a
where a = ¯k mod 2(cid:96) is known, and

2n−(cid:96) ≤ b < 2n−(cid:96) +

q/2(cid:96)(cid:109)
(cid:108)

.

(1)

Following previous works we use (cid:98)·(cid:99)q to denote the reduc-
tion modulo q to the range [0, q) and | · |q for the reduction
modulo q to the range (−q/2, q/2). Within these expres-
sions division operations are carried over the reals whereas
all other operations are carried over GF (q).

We now look at (cid:4)b − 2n−(cid:96)(cid:5)

.

Out of the HNP instances we generate, we select at ran-
dom 49 for the SSH attack, 130 for the TLS attack and
construct a lattice as described in Section 2.5.2. We solve
the CVP problem with a Sage script, performing lattice re-
duction using BKZ [34], and enumerate the lattice points
using Babai’s Nearest Plane (NP) algorithm [7]. We ap-
ply two diﬀerent techniques to extend NP to a larger search
space. First, we take multiple rounding values to explore
210 diﬀerent solutions in the tree paths [23, Sec. 4]. Second,
we use a randomization technique [26, Sec. 3.5] and shuﬄe
the rows of B between lattice reductions. We repeat with
a diﬀerent random selection of instances until we ﬁnd the
private key.

6.3 Results

We implemented the attack and evaluated it against the
two protocols, SSH with 1024/160-bit DSA and TLS with
2048/256-bit DSA. Table 2 contains the results. For both
protocols we only utilize traces with (cid:96) ≥ 3. With this value
we experimentally found that we require 49 such signatures
for SSH and 130 for TLS in order to achieve a reasonable
probability of solving the resulting CVP.

Because the nonces are chosen uniformly at random, only
about one in every four signatures has an (cid:96) that we can
utilize. To gather enough signatures and to compensate for
possible trace errors, we collect 580 SM sequences from TLS
handshakes and 260 from SSH.

On average, these collected sequences yield 70.8 (SSH)
and 158.1 (TLS) traces with (cid:96) ≥ 3. Comparing the traces to
the ground truth, we know that on average less than 3 have
trace errors. However, because an adversary cannot check
against the ground truth, we leave these erroneous traces
in the set and use them in the attack. We note that due
to the smaller key size in SSH, trace errors are much more
prevalent there.

We construct a lattice from a random selection of the col-
lected traces and attempt to solve the resulting CVP. Due
to the presence of the error traces there is a non-negligible
probability that our selected set contains an error. Further-
more, even if all the chosen traces are correct, the algorithm
may fail to ﬁnd the target solution due to the heuristic na-
ture of lattice techniques. In case of failure, we repeat the
process with a new random selection from the same set. We
need to execute a median value of 13 iterations for SSH and
22 for TLS until we ﬁnd the target solution.

As seen from Table 2, repeating our experiment over a
thousand trials on a cluster with hundreds of nodes, mixed
between Intel X5660 and AMD Opteron 2435 cores, we ﬁnd
the private key in all cases requiring a median 5.9 CPU min-
utes for the SSH key and 38.8 CPU minutes for the TLS key.
Although we executed each trial on a single core, in reality
the iterations are independent of each other—the lattice at-
tack is embarrassingly parallel.

7. CONCLUSION

In this work we disclose a programming error in Open-
SSL that results in a security weakness. We show that as
a result of the defect, the DSA implementation in Open-
SSL is vulnerable to cache-timing attacks, and exploit the
vulnerability to mount end-to-end attacks against SSH (via
OpenSSH) and TLS (via stunnel).

It is all too easy to dismiss the bug as an innocent pro-

gramming error. However, we believe that the core issue is
a design problem. When designing the “constant-time” ﬁx,
the developers elected to use an insecure default behavior.
From an engineering perspective the decision is justiﬁed—
it is much easier to identify the handful of locations where
we know that the exponent should be kept secret than to
analyze the entire library identifying exponents that can be
leaked. However, from a security perspective, this design
decision breaches the principle of fail-safe defaults, which
Saltzer and Schroeder [33] justify by saying: a design or
implementation mistake in a mechanism that explicitly ex-
cludes access tends to fail by allowing access, a failure which
may go unnoticed in normal use.

It is hard not to appreciate the extraordinary prescience of
Saltzer and Schroeder’s justiﬁcation. Had OpenSSL elected
to use a better design, that defaults to the constant-time be-
havior, a similar bug could have resulted in a small perfor-
mance loss for non-sensitive exponentiations, but the omis-
sion to preserve the ﬂag in question would have been unlikely
to jeopardize the security of the system. A more secure de-
sign would also improve the security of third-party products
in the case that developers may not be aware of the intrica-
cies of the constant-time ﬂags.

The simplest software-based solution to mitigate our at-
tack is to ﬁx the software defect. During responsible disclo-
sure, OpenSSL, LibreSSL, and BoringSSL merged patches
for CVE-2016-217813, assigned as a result of this work.

Broader, the clflush instruction does not require elevated
privileges to execute, hence we suggest access control mech-
anisms. We recommend that cache ﬂush instructions be
privileged-only execution, or at least restricted to memory
pages to which the process has write access and to memory
pages explicitly allowed by the kernel. Partially or fully dis-
abling caching during sensitive code execution can prevent
cache-timing attacks at the cost of performance [3]. Pre-
venting page sharing between processes is a partial solution
at the cost of increased memory requirements and avoiding
sharing of sensitive code is possible by changing the program
loader.

We close with some practical advice regarding this vul-
nerability. OpenSSH supports building without OpenSSL
as a dependency. We recommend that OpenSSH package
maintainers switch to this option. For OpenSSH adminis-
trators and users, we recommend migrating to ssh-ed25519
key types, the implementation of which has many desirable
side-channel properties. Furthermore, ensure that ssh-dss
is absent from the HostKeyAlgorithms conﬁguration ﬁeld,
and any such HostKey entries removed. On the TLS side,
we recommend disabling cipher suites that have DSA func-
tionality as a pre-requisite.

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1362183#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-08-01 13:18:54 UTC  ``` It was reported that libcurl would attempt to resume a TLS session even if the client certificate had changed. That is unacceptable since a server by specification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on resume, and may instead use the old identity which was established by the previous certificate (or no certificate).  libcurl supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume previous TLS sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes. They are used when for any reason an existing TLS connection couldn't be kept alive to make the next handshake faster.

# Security Policy

## Reporting security issues

If you wish to report a possible security issue in OpenSSL please
[notify us](/community/#reporting-security-bugssecurityreports).

## Issue triage

Notifications are received by the OMC and OTC. We engage resources within
OpenSSL to start the investigation and prioritisation. We may work in
private with individuals who are not on the OMC or OTC as well as other
organisations and our [employers](/community/thanks/)
where we believe this can help with the issue investigation, resolution, or
testing.

## Threat Model

Certain threats are currently considered outside of the scope of the
OpenSSL threat model. Accordingly, we do not consider OpenSSL secure
against the following classes of attacks:

* same physical system side channel
* CPU/hardware flaws
* physical fault injection
* physical observation side channels (e.g. power consumption,
  EM emissions, etc)

Mitigations for security issues outside of our threat scope may still be
addressed, however we do not class these as OpenSSL vulnerabilities and
will therefore not issue CVEs for any mitigations to address these issues.

We are working towards making the same physical system side channel attacks
very hard.

Prior to the threat model being included in this policy, CVEs were sometimes
issued for these classes of attacks. The existence of a previous CVE does
not override this policy going forward.

## Issue severity

We will determine the risk of each issue, taking into account our experience
dealing with past issues, versions affected, common defaults, and use cases.
We use the following severity categories:

* **CRITICAL** Severity. This affects common
  configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable. Examples
  include significant disclosure of the contents of server memory
  (potentially revealing user details), vulnerabilities which can be easily
  exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or where remote code
  execution is considered likely in common situations. These issues will be
  kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We
  will attempt to address these as soon as possible.
* **HIGH** Severity. This includes issues that are of a
  lower risk than critical, perhaps due to affecting less common
  configurations, or which are less likely to be exploitable. These issues
  will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported
  versions. We will attempt to keep the time these issues are private to a
  minimum; our aim would be no longer than a month where this is something
  under our control.
* **MODERATE** Severity. This includes issues like
  crashes in client applications, flaws in protocols that are less commonly
  used (such as DTLS), and local flaws. These will in general be kept
  private until the next release, and that release will be scheduled so
  that it can roll up several such flaws at one time.
* **LOW** Severity. This includes issues such as those
  that only affect the openssl command line utility, or unlikely
  configurations. These will in general be fixed immediately in latest
  development versions, and may be backported to older versions that are
  still getting updates. We will update the vulnerabilities page and note
  the issue CVE in the changelog and commit message, but they may not
  trigger new releases.

## Prenotification policy

* Where we are planning an update that fixes security issues we will notify
  the [openssl-announce list](https://groups.google.com/a/openssl.org/g/openssl-announce/)
  and update the OpenSSL website to give our scheduled update release date
  and time and the severity of issues being fixed by the update. No further
  information about the issues will be given.
* Where we are planning an update that include CRITICAL, HIGH, or MODERATE severity
  issues we will also prenotify certain organisations with more details
  and patches.
  + The organisations we prenotify include those that produce a general
    purpose OS that uses OpenSSL as included on [this list of Operating
    System distribution security contacts](http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros).
  + We also include other open source projects that are derived from OpenSSL
    which have a significant user base and a reciprocal arrangement.
  + We may also include other organisations that are not listed but would
    otherwise qualify for list membership.
  + We may also include organisations with which we have a commercial
    relationship.
  + We may withdraw notifying certain organisations from future
    prenotifications if they leak issues before they are public or over time
    do not add value.

Note: researchers or intermediaries who notify us of issues may have their
own prenotification policy in addition to ours.

## Principles

The policy above is guided by our security principles:

* It’s in the best interests of the Internet as a whole to get fixes for
  OpenSSL security issues out quickly. OpenSSL embargoes should be measured
  in days and weeks, not months or years.
* Many sites affected by OpenSSL issues will be running a version of OpenSSL
  they got from some vendor (and likely bundled with an operating system).
  The most effective way for these sites to get protected is to get an
  updated version from that vendor.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0193)

## Topic

Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.23 and fix several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release adds the new Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 packages that are part of the JBoss Core Services offering.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.6, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for creating a virtual host mapping rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow. (CVE-2016-6808)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)
* An error was found in protocol parsing logic of mod\_cluster load balancer Apache HTTP Server modules. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process. (CVE-2016-8612)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Bock, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes
described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library
must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release includes bug fixes as well as a new release of OpenSSL. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections form other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# [R7] Nessus 6.9 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus is potentially impacted by several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (20160926) that were recently disclosed and fixed. Note that due to the time involved in doing a full analysis of each issue, Tenable has opted to upgrade the included version of OpenSSL as a precaution, and to save time. These vulnerabilities may impact Nessus and include:

* CVE-2016-6308 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6305 - OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6304 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6306 - OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* CVE-2016-6307 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6303 - OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* CVE-2016-6329 - Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* CVE-2016-6302 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2179 - OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2181 - OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2182 - OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* CVE-2016-2180 - OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* CVE-2016-2178 - OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* CVE-2016-2177 - OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* CVE-2016-6309 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* CVE-2016-7052 - OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS

Additionally, Nessus and Tenable's managed Nessus Cloud offering were found to be impacted by an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue reported to us by Noriaki Iwasaki (CVE-2016-9260). Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us and giving us time to resolve the issue. Tenable would also like to thank JPCERT/CC for the coordination of their advisory on this issue.

Notes and caveats:

1. Nessus Agents are not affected by these issues, as they do not act as an SSL server.
2. The CVSSv2 score reflects CVE-2016-6302 and other remote DoS issues.
3. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that Nessus be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus version 6.9 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), which is not affected, and addresses the XSS issue.

To update your Nessus installation, follow these steps:

* Download the appropriate installation file to the system hosting Nessus Professional or Nessus Manager, available at the Tenable Support Portal (<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=200>)
* Stop the Nessus service.
* Install according to your operating system procedures.
* Restart the Nessus service.

Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
the severity of this vulnerability is Low.

Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we’re aware of, either only “named
curves” are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can’t represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an “exotic”
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC\_GROUP\_new\_curve\_GF2m(), EC\_GROUP\_new\_from\_params(),
and various supporting BN\_GF2m\_\*() functions.

Applications working with “exotic” explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, …) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don’t perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain. So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL\_select\_next\_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL\_select\_next\_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL\_select\_next\_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client\_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client\_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a “no overlap”
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function is accidentally called with a
client\_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_free\_buffers may cause
memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL\_free\_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not
vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by
applications.

The SSL\_free\_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used
when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected
to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have
been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the
network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.
In this case calling SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though a record has only
been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has
been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of
this data. Again a call to SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though the buffer
is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check()
or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded
memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL\_OP\_NO\_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early\_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12\_parse(),
PKCS12\_unpack\_p7data(), PKCS12\_unpack\_p7encdata(), PKCS12\_unpack\_authsafes()
and PKCS12\_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME\_write\_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take
a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
with the ‘-pubin’ and ‘-check’ options on untrusted data.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.

Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_generate\_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications
that use DH\_check\_pub\_key(), DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

While DH\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),
DH\_check\_pub\_key() doesn’t make any of these checks, and is therefore
vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.

Likewise, while DH\_generate\_key() performs a check for an excessively large
P, it doesn’t check for an excessively large Q.

An application that calls DH\_generate\_key() or DH\_check\_pub\_key() and
supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

DH\_generate\_key() and DH\_check\_pub\_key() are also called by a number of
other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other
functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this
are DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex(), EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check(), and EVP\_PKEY\_generate().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the
“-pubcheck” option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() or
EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() the provided OSSL\_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length,
via the “keylen” parameter or the IV length, via the “ivlen” parameter,
within the OSSL\_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST’s SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because
the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.

OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the
Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86\_64 processors supporting the
AVX512-IFMA instructions.

Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker
can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does
not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform
when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to
the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their
previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\_64 processors
supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so
the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,
if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent
calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD
cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using
OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of
any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we
consider this a Low severity security issue.

As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at
runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\_ia32cap:

OPENSSL\_ia32cap=:~0x200000

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,
if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is
unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
The other functions affected by this are DH\_check\_ex() and
EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the “-check” option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()

delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those
checks confirms that the modulus (‘p’ parameter) is not too large. Trying to use
a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which
is over 10,000 bits in length.

However the DH\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters
that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value
even if it has already been found to be too large.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.

Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as
a consequence.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to
authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing,
adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL
implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.

The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
application has to call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP\_CipherUpdate()) with
NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call
instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
The empty data thus will not be authenticated.

As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and
we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or
data containing them may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ\_obj2txt() directly, or use any of
the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message
size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those
messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.

An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -
most of which have no size limit. OBJ\_obj2txt() may be used to translate
an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL
type ASN1\_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the
sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by
periods.

When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large
(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds
of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long
time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with ’n’ being the size of the
sub-identifiers in bytes (\*).

With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /
identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching
algorithms.

Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure
AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify
what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or
decrypt, or digest passed data.

Applications that call OBJ\_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are
affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose
of display, the severity is considered low.

In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,
CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509
certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.

The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a
100KiB limit on the peer’s certificate chain. Additionally, this only
impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
authentication.

In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,
such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way
that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered
not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
and the severity is therefore considered low.

Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM
platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,
leading to a crash.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM
platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually
used for disk encryption.

The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read
past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16
byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext
buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of
service.

If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue
a Low severity one.

The function X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was
decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy()
function.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate
policy check need to use X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_policies() or explicitly
enable the policy check by calling X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set\_flags() with
the X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK flag argument.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not
commonly used by applications.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be
vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by
OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.
A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies
in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.

The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS
enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading
the legacy provider.

PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
not call these functions however third party applications would be
affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
data.

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL\_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp as an ASN1\_TYPE rather than an
ASN1\_STRING.

When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network.

The public API function BIO\_new\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
end user applications.

The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\_f\_asn1 filter
BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
to call BIO\_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
likely result in a crash.

This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\_write\_ASN1() which
may cause BIO\_new\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\_pop() on
the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
PEM\_write\_bio\_ASN1\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_CMS\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_PKCS7\_stream,
SMIME\_write\_ASN1, SMIME\_write\_CMS and SMIME\_write\_PKCS7.

Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
i2d\_ASN1\_bio\_stream, BIO\_new\_CMS, BIO\_new\_PKCS7, i2d\_CMS\_bio\_stream and
i2d\_PKCS7\_bio\_stream.

The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.

The function PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
decodes the “name” (e.g. “CERTIFICATE”), any header data and the payload data.
If the function succeeds then the “name\_out”, “header” and “data” arguments are
populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The
caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a
PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\_read\_bio\_ex()
will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer
to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer
then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM
files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.

The functions PEM\_read\_bio() and PEM\_read() are simple wrappers around
PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.

These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
functions including PEM\_X509\_INFO\_read\_bio\_ex() and
SSL\_CTX\_use\_serverinfo\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal
uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the
header argument if PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
include the PEM\_read\_bio\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in
OpenSSL 3.0.

The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker
would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for
decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an
encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a
sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
application data sent over that connection.

A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs
after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a
CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
to a trusted issuer.

The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to
a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure
of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext)
although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory
contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.

In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
client authentication and a malicious client connects.

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy
processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
to be a common setup.

Policy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy`
argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() and EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID\_undef as this value in the call to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). When NID\_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() using NID\_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86\_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86\_64 architecture are affected by this issue.

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasnât written. In the special case of âin placeâ encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.

The OPENSSL\_LH\_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common.

The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP\_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP\_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL âocspâ application. When verifying an ocsp response with the â-no\_cert\_checksâ option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.

The BN\_mod\_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN\_mod\_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022.

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021, and the release of 1.0.2zc on the 22nd of February 2022. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms.

Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509\_verify\_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL\_connect() or SSL\_do\_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL\_get\_error() to return the value SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL\_CTX\_set\_cert\_verify\_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY return value from SSL\_get\_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509\_verify\_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1\_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSLâs own âd2iâ functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1\_STRING\_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1\_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1\_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the âdataâ and âlengthâ fields in the ASN1\_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1\_STRING\_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1\_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1\_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the âdataâ field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1\_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509\_get1\_email(), X509\_REQ\_get1\_email() and X509\_get1\_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1\_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the âoutâ parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the âoutlenâ parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the âoutâ parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a âpurposeâ has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named âpurposeâ values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSLâs s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the â-crl\_downloadâ option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSLâs parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked.

The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue.

In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS\_decrypt or PKCS7\_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt.

If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable ânon-stitchedâ ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted.

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the âprefix / âopenssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be â/usr/localâ. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of âC:/usr/localâ, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSLâs default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, â/usr/local/sslâ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own âprefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

There is an overflow bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN\_mod\_exp may be affected if they use BN\_FLG\_CONSTTIME.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL\_init\_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL\_INIT\_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used.

ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.

During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.

There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an âerror stateâ mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL\_do\_handshake(), SSL\_accept() and SSL\_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL\_read() or SSL\_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites. Note: This issue is very similar to CVE-2015-3193 but must be treated as a separate problem.

If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attackerâs direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

Applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.

This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a, released on 22nd September 2016. The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.

A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms. The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.

A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the âno-ocspâ build time option are not affected. Servers using OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in a default configuration, instead only if an application explicitly enables OCSP stapling support.

An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE\_MAX which is impractical on most platforms.

Because DES (and triple-DES) has only a 64-bit block size, birthday attacks are a real concern. For example, with the ability to run Javascript in a browser, it is possible to send enough traffic to cause a collision, and then use that information to recover something like a session Cookie. Triple-DES, which shows up as âDES-CBC3â in an OpenSSL cipher string, is still used on the Web, and major browsers are not yet willing to completely disable it. If you run a server, you should disable triple-DES. This is generally a configuration issue. If you run an old server that doesnât support any better ciphers than DES or RC4, you should upgrade. For 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, we removed the triple-DES ciphers from the âHIGHâ keyword and put them into âMEDIUM.â Note that we did not remove them from the âDEFAULTâ keyword. For the 1.1.0 release, we treat triple-DES just like we are treating RC4. It is not compiled by default; you have to use âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ as a config option. Even when those ciphers are compiled, triple-DES is only in the âMEDIUMâ keyword. In addition we also removed it from the âDEFAULTâ keyword.

A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that arrive for future epochs update the replay protection âwindowâ before the MAC for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific DTLS connection.

In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simulataneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.

Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.

Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: âp + len > limitâ Where âpâ points to some mallocâd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE âlenâ here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message). The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that âp + lenâ is only well defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour. For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for âpâ such that âp + lenâ actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len < limit.

This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of the bug was not known at the time. In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in i2c\_ASN1\_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create ânegative zeroesâ when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug. However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i\_ASN1\_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY structures. Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations. Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSLâs default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.

A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP\_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP\_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP\_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP\_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Internally to OpenSSL the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM\_write\_bio\* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM\_write\_bio\* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).

A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if theyâve not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time. Builds that are not configured with âenable-ssl2â will not support SSLv2. Even if âenable-ssl2â is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23\_method() will need to explicitly call either of: SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options(ctx, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); or SSL\_clear\_options(ssl, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2\_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured with âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ will not provide any âEXPORTâ or âLOWâ strength ciphers.

The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a â%sâ format string in the BIO\_\*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally the internal |doapr\_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT\_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long â%sâ format string. Memory leaks can also occur. The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

The SRP user database lookup method SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user had confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in constant time.

In the BN\_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value |i|. Later |bn\_expand| is called with a value of |i \* 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn\_expand| not allocating any memory because |i \* 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i \* 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN\_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.

If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation.

Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on âsafeâ primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be âsafeâ. Where an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not âsafeâ then an attacker could use this fact to find a peerâs private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS serverâs private DH exponent if itâs reusing the private DH exponent or itâs using a static DH ciphersuite. OpenSSL provides the option SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk. OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if: - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh() is used and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not set. - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used, and both the parameters and the key are set and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not used. This is an undocumted feature and parameter files donât contain the key. - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2. It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if: - SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is set - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used and the callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is almost always used like this. Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using: - genpkey with the dh\_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file including the prime-order subgroup size âqâ. This is supported since the 1.0.2 version. Older versions canât read files generated in this way. - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as requiring the single use. The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a âqâ parameter is available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. This could have some performance impact. Additionally the SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

Multiblock corrupted pointer. OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the âmultiblockâ performance improvement. This feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of âmultiblockâ can cause OpenSSLâs internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking IO. Typically, when the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connection. However if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentation fault will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attack.

OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature algorithm and signature encodings. OpenSSL also does not enforce a match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned portions of the certificate. By modifying the contents of the signature algorithm or the encoding of the signature, it is possible to change the certificateâs fingerprint. This does not allow an attacker to forge certificates, and does not affect certificate verification or OpenSSL servers/clients in any other way. It also does not affect common revocation mechanisms. Only custom applications that rely on the uniqueness of the fingerprint (e.g. certificate blacklists) may be affected.

This bug occurs at random with a very low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been determined: \*) The probability of BN\_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. \*) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. \*) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected. \*) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.

## 2003

### [CVE-2003-0851](#CVE-2003-0851)

Published at
4 November 2003
Found by
Novell
Affected

* from 0.9.6k before 0.9.6l

References

* [CVE Record](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0851)
* [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20031104.txt)

A flaw in OpenSSL 0.9.6k (only) would cause certain ASN.1 sequences to trigger a large recursion. On platforms such as Windows this large recursion cannot be handled correctly and so the bug causes OpenSSL to crash. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw if they can send arbitrary ASN.1 sequences which would cause OpenSSL to crash. This could be performed for example by sending a client certificate to a SSL/TLS enabled server which is configured to accept them.

### [CVE-2003-0545](#CVE-2003-0545)

# CVE-2016-2183

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-2182.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-2184.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-2183 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183)

#### Description

The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.

Of these 14 vulnerabilities, the OpenSSL Software Foundation classifies one as “Critical Severity,” one as “Moderate Severity,” and the other 12 as “Low Severity.”         Subsequently, on September 26, the OpenSSL Software Foundation released an additional advisory that describes two new vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities affect the OpenSSL versions that were released to address the vulnerabilities disclosed in the previous advisory. One of the new vulnerabilities was rated as “High Severity” and the other as “Moderate Severity.”         Of the 16 released vulnerabilities:   + Fourteen track issues that could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition   + One (CVE-2016-2183, aka SWEET32) tracks an implementation of a Birthday attack against Transport Layer Security (TLS) block ciphers that use a 64-bit block size that could result in loss of confidentiality   + One (CVE-2016-2178) is a timing side-channel attack that, in specific circumstances, could allow an attacker to derive the private DSA key that belongs to another user or service running on the same system   Five of the 16 vulnerabilities exclusively affect the recently released OpenSSL versions that are part of the 1.1.0 release series, which has not yet been integrated into any Cisco product.      This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160927-openssl>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine   which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities and the impact   on each affected product.

Cisco Broadband Access Center for Telco and Wireless   *Cisco Hosted Services*   + Cisco ONE Portal  Details  * The associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs for the vulnerabilities that were disclosed on September 22, 2016, and September 26, 2016, in the OpenSSL Software Foundation security advisories are as follows:       + CVE-2016-2177   + CVE-2016-2178   + CVE-2016-2179   + CVE-2016-2180   + CVE-2016-2181   + CVE-2016-2182   + CVE-2016-2183   + CVE-2016-6302   + CVE-2016-6303   + CVE-2016-6304   + CVE-2016-6305   + CVE-2016-6306   + CVE-2016-6307   + CVE-2016-6308   + CVE-2016-6309   + CVE-2016-7052      Additional Details   **OpenSSL OCSP Stapling Status Request Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling implementation of OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to keep consuming memory on the targeted system. The vulnerability is due to the implementation of the OCSP Status Request SSL/TLS extension.       An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing an SSL/TLS session to the targeted system and iteratively performing renegotiation, sending an OCSP Status Request each time. An exploit could allow the attacker to indefinitely keep increasing the memory allocated to the process that is running the vulnerable OpenSSL code.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-6304.      **OpenSSL 3DES CBC Mode Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to a cipher block collision that may occur during an encrypted session where OpenSSL uses a 64-bit block cipher, such as 3DES Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. An attacker who is able to capture nearly a terabyte of network traffic could exploit this vulnerability to monitor a cipher block collision, which could be leveraged to decrypt data in transit and gain access to sensitive information. A successful exploit could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.   This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-2183.      **Vulnerabilities Not Applicable to Cisco Products**      The vulnerabilities identified by the following CVE IDs exclusively affect the recently released OpenSSL versions that are part of the 1.1.0 release series, which has not yet been integrated into any Cisco product:      + CVE-2016-6305   + CVE-2016-6307   + CVE-2016-6308   + CVE-2016-6309   + CVE-2016-7052      For details about the remainder of the vulnerabilities, please refer to the security advisories published by the OpenSSL Software Foundation:   + [September 22, 2016 Security Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt)   + [September 26, 2016 Security Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160926.txt)  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Updates for affected software releases will be published when they are available and information about those updates will be documented in Cisco bugs, which are accessible from the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID).      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

# USN-3087-1: OpenSSL vulnerabilities

22 September 2016

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request

extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory

consumption, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6304](/security/CVE-2016-6304))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when

performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update.

([CVE-2016-2177](/security/CVE-2016-2177))

César Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL

did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing

attack and recover private DSA keys. ([CVE-2016-2178](/security/CVE-2016-2178))

Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime

of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of

service. ([CVE-2016-2179](/security/CVE-2016-2179))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the

TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2180](/security/CVE-2016-2180))

It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay

feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2016-2181](/security/CVE-2016-2181))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-2182](/security/CVE-2016-2182))

Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES

ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could

possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted

sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM.

([CVE-2016-2183](/security/CVE-2016-2183))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths.

A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-6302](/security/CVE-2016-6302))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the

MDC2\_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6303](/security/CVE-2016-6303))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message

length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6306](/security/CVE-2016-6306))

# [R3] PVS 5.2.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable's Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) uses third-party libraries to provide certain standardized functionality. Four of these libraries were found to contain vulnerabilities and were fixed upstream. Those fixes have been integrated despite there being no known exploitation scenarios related to PVS.

* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* SQLite Insecure Temporary Directory Usage Local Issue
* Expat XML Parser Input Document Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c XML\_GetBuffer() Function Compressed XML Content Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c generate\_hash\_secret\_salt() Function PRNG Non-random Output Generation Weakness
* Expat xmlparse.c Hash Table Collision DoS
* jQuery UI dialog() Function closeText Parameter XSS

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the OpenSSL integration into PVS and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact PVS at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that PVS be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

Additionally, a reflected XSS vulnerability affecting the PVS Web GUI was fixed in the HTML 1.7.1 and Web Server 1.8.0 updates delivered via the plugin feed on November 14, 2016. A default install of PVS 5.2.0 includes these fixes. This issue was reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

### Solution

Tenable has released version 5.2.0 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), jQuery UI (1.12.0), Expat (2.2.0), and SQLite (3.13.0), which are not affected. The new version is available at:

**Notes**: Splunk Enterprise 5.0.x will not be patched for OpenSSL issues. Splunk recommends updating to the latest version of Splunk Enterprise.

In order to address the OpenSSL SWEET32, vulnerability, along with the version update, the SSL cipherSuite should be updated on inputs.conf file to remove medium strength ciphers (:Medium:).

### Multiple Vulnerabilities in Python (CVE-2016-5636, CVE-2016-5699, CVE-2016-0772) (SPL-128812)

#### Description

The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries associated with unused out-of-order messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, related to d1\_lib.c, statem\_dtls.c, statem\_lib.c, and statem\_srvr.c.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1382352#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-10-06 12:59:01 UTC  ``` The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to create a virtual host mapping rule. It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.

Subject: Re: CVE-2016-2178: OpenSSL DSA follows a non-constant
 time codepath for certain operations

I assume the OpenSSL team considers this vulnerability to be LOW severity:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-07 09:12:18 UTC  ``` Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.  Upstream fix:  <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=d168705e11526a4b487640c7cac5b53ee3646cbc> <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=3681a4558c13198944e6f7f149c4be188e076e14>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-07 09:13:06 UTC  ```  Created openssl101e tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1343403](show_bug.cgi?id=1343403 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2178 openssl101e: openssl: Non-constant time codepath followed for certain operations in DSA implementation [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-07 09:13:20 UTC  ```  Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1343401](show_bug.cgi?id=1343401 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2178 openssl: Non-constant time codepath followed for certain operations in DSA implementation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c3)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-07 09:13:31 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1343402](show_bug.cgi?id=1343402 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-2178 mingw-openssl: openssl: Non-constant time codepath followed for certain operations in DSA implementation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c5)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-08 15:49:23 UTC  ``` Lowering the initial impact because of the nature of time-channel attack.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c6)  Andrej Nemec    2016-06-09 07:56:49 UTC  ``` References (thread contains a discussion about severity of this issue):  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/493>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-19 20:17:01 UTC  ``` Details of the issue and the attack taking advantage of it:  <http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/594> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/594.pdf>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1343400#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-22 12:00:58 UTC  ``` Covered now by OpenSSL upstream security advisory and fixed in versions 1.0.1u and 1.0.2i.   Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing ([CVE-2016-2178](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2178)) ===============================================================  Severity: Low  Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 23rd May 2016 by César Pereida (Aalto University), Billy Brumley (Tampere University of Technology), and Yuval Yarom (The University of Adelaide and NICTA).

## Topic

An update for openssl is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* It was discovered that the Datagram TLS (DTLS) implementation could fail to release memory in certain cases. A malicious DTLS client could cause a DTLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory. (CVE-2016-2179)
* A flaw was found in the Datagram TLS (DTLS) replay protection implementation in OpenSSL. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a DTLS server using OpenSSL to reject further packets sent from a DTLS client over an established DTLS connection. (CVE-2016-2181)
* An out of bounds write flaw was discovered in the OpenSSL BN\_bn2dec() function. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL to process a large BIGNUM could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2182)
* A flaw was found in the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

This update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by lowering priority of DES cipher suites so they are not preferred over cipher suites using AES. For compatibility reasons, DES cipher suites remain enabled by default and included in the set of cipher suites identified by the HIGH cipher string. Future updates may move them to MEDIUM or not enable them by default.

* An integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read was found in the way OpenSSL parsed TLS session tickets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a TLS server using OpenSSL if it used SHA-512 as HMAC for session tickets. (CVE-2016-6302)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)
* An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way OpenSSL formatted Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol data for printing. An attacker could possibly cause an application using OpenSSL to crash if it printed time stamp data from the attacker. (CVE-2016-2180)
* Multiple out of bounds read flaws were found in the way OpenSSL handled certain TLS/SSL protocol handshake messages. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to crash a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL. (CVE-2016-6306)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and CVE-2016-6306 and OpenVPN for reporting CVE-2016-2183. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304 and CVE-2016-6306; and Karthikeyan Bhargavan (Inria) and Gaëtan Leurent (Inria) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2183.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

Subject: Re: CVE-2016-2178: OpenSSL DSA follows a non-constant
 time codepath for certain operations

Hi,

the openssl team usually announces those LOW issues together with the other
issues during their semi regular advisories.

(And usually as soon as these LOW CVE issues are getting added to git, a
new advisory is not far away.)

Ciao, Marcus

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1359615#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-07-25 06:53:02 UTC  ``` An OOB read flaw was found in the RFC 3161 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol code of OpenSSL. An attacker could use this flaw to cause the openssl binary to crash when specially-crafted time-stamp file is parsed via the "openssl ts" command.

Other applications using the OpenSSL library may also use this functionality, but it does not seem to be used by any other application in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1359615#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-22 12:01:50 UTC  ``` Covered now by OpenSSL upstream security advisory and fixed in versions 1.0.1u and 1.0.2i.   OOB read in TS_OBJ_print_bio() ([CVE-2016-2180](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2180)) ==============================================  Severity: Low  The function TS_OBJ_print_bio() misuses OBJ_obj2txt(): the return value is the total length the OID text representation would use and not the amount of data written. This will result in OOB reads when large OIDs are presented.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 21st July 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL development team.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0194)

## Topic

An update is now available for JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

This release adds the new Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 packages that are part of the JBoss Core Services offering.

This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Pack Apache Server 2.4.6 and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)
* It was found that the length checks prior to writing to the target buffer for creating a virtual host mapping rule did not take account of the length of the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow. (CVE-2016-6808)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)
* It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)
* An error was found in protocol parsing logic of mod\_cluster load balancer Apache HTTP Server modules. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process. (CVE-2016-8612)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Bock, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

RHSA-2017:1659 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-06-28
Updated:
2017-06-28
# RHSA-2017:1659 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.16 natives update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release includes bug fixes as well as a new release of OpenSSL that addresses a number of outstanding security flaws. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections form other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

#### Description

The Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 mishandles early use of a new epoch number in conjunction with a large sequence number, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (false-positive packet drops) via spoofed DTLS records, related to rec\_layer\_d1.c and ssl3\_record.c.

# Undefined Pointer Arithmetic

Jun 27, 2016

In commits a004e72b9 (1.0.2) and 6f35f6deb (1.0.1) we released a fix for
CVE-2016-2177. The fix corrects a common coding idiom present in OpenSSL 1.0.2
and OpenSSL 1.0.1 which actually relies on a usage of pointer arithmetic that
is undefined in the C specification. The problem does not exist in master
(OpenSSL 1.1.0) which refactored this code some while ago. This usage could give
rise to a low severity security issue in certain unusual scenarios. The OpenSSL
security policy (<https://openssl-library.org/policies/general/security-policy/>) states that we
publish low severity issues directly to our public repository, and they get
rolled up into the next release whenever that happens. The rest of this blog
post describes the problem in a little more detail, explains the scenarios
where a security issue could arise and why this issue has been rated as low
severity.

The coding idiom we are talking about here is this one:

```
if (p + len > limit)
{
    return; /* Too long */
}

```

Where `p` points to some malloc’d data of `SIZE` bytes and `limit == p + SIZE`.
`len` here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS
message).

The idea here is that we are performing a length check on peer supplied
data to ensure that `len` (received from the peer) is actually within the
bounds of the supplied data. The problem is that this pointer arithmetic
is only defined by the C90 standard (which we aim to conform to) if `len <= SIZE`, so if `len` **is** too long then this is undefined behaviour, and
of course (theoretically) anything could happen. In practice of course
it usually works the way you expect it to work and there is no issue
**except** in the case where an overflow occurs.

In order for an overflow to occur `p + len` would have to be sufficiently
large to exceed the maximum addressable location. Recall that `len` here
is received from the peer. However in all the instances that we fixed it
represents either one byte or two bytes, i.e. its maximum value is
`0xFFFF`. Assuming a flat 32 bit address space this means that if `p < 0xFFFF0000` then there is no issue, or putting it another way, approx.
0.0015% of all conceivable addresses are potentially “at risk”.

Most architectures do not have the heap at the edge of high memory. Typically,
one finds:

```
    0: Reserved low-memory
    LOW:    TEXT
            DATA
            BSS
            HEAP
            BREAK
            ...
            mapped libraries and files
            STACK

```

And often (on systems with a unified kernel/user address space):

```
HIGH:
    kernel

```

I don’t claim to know much about memory lay outs so perhaps there are
architectures out there that don’t conform to this. So, assuming that
they exist, what would the impact be if `p` was sufficiently large that an
overflow could occur?

There are two primary locations where a 2 byte `len` could be an issue (I
will ignore 1 byte `len`s because it seems highly unlikely that we will
ever run into a problem with those in reality). The first location is
whilst reading in the ciphersuites in a ClientHello, and the second is
whilst reading in the extensions in the ClientHello.

Here is the (pre-patch) ciphersuite code:

```
n2s(p, i);
if (i == 0) {
    al = SSL_AD_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER;
    SSLerr(SSL_F_SSL3_GET_CLIENT_HELLO, SSL_R_NO_CIPHERS_SPECIFIED);
    goto f_err;
}
/* i bytes of cipher data + 1 byte for compression length later */
if ((p + i + 1) > (d + n)) {
    /* not enough data */
    al = SSL_AD_DECODE_ERROR;
    SSLerr(SSL_F_SSL3_GET_CLIENT_HELLO, SSL_R_LENGTH_MISMATCH);
    goto f_err;
}
if (ssl_bytes_to_cipher_list(s, p, i, &(ciphers)) == NULL) {
    goto err;
}
p += i;

```

Here `i` represents the two byte length read from the peer, `p` is the
pointer into our buffer, and `d + n` is the end of the buffer. If
`p + i+ 1` overflows then we will end up passing an excessively large `i`
value to `ssl_bytes_to_cipher_list()`. Analysing that function it can be
seen that it will loop over all of the memory from `p` onwards
interpreting it as ciphersuite data bytes and attempting to read its
value. This is likely to cause a crash once we overflow (if not before).

The analysis of the extensions code is similar and more complicated, but
the outcome is the same. It will loop over the out-of-bounds memory
interpreting it as extension data and will eventually crash.

It seems that the only way the above two issues could be exploited is via a DoS.

The final consideration in all of this, is how much of the above is
under the control of the attacker. Clearly `len` is, but not the value
of `p`. In order to exploit this an attacker would have to first find a
system which is likely to allocate at the very highest end of address
space and then send a high number of requests through until one “got
lucky” and a DoS results. A possible alternative approach is to send out
many requests to many hosts attempting to find one that is vulnerable.

It appears that such attacks, whilst possible, are unlikely and
would be difficult to achieve successfully in reality - with a worst
case scenario being a DoS. Given the difficulty of the attack and the
relatively low impact we rated this as a low severity issue.

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the worst of
which allows attackers to conduct a time based side-channel attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.2j** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.2j** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. Please review
the CVE identifiers and the International Association for Cryptologic
Research’s (IACR) paper, “Make Sure DSA Signing Exponentiations
Really are Constant-Time” for further details.

### Impact

Remote attackers could cause a Denial of Service condition or have other
unspecified impacts. Additionally, a time based side-channel attack may
allow a local attacker to recover a private DSA key.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.2j"

```

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

* [Notes for UNIX-like platforms](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-UNIX.md)
* [Notes for Android platforms](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-ANDROID.md)
* [Notes for Windows platforms](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-WINDOWS.md)
* [Notes for the DOS platform with DJGPP](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-DJGPP.md)

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

* [Notes for Android platforms](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-ANDROID.md)
* [Notes for Windows platforms](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-WINDOWS.md)
* [Notes for the DOS platform with DJGPP](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-DJGPP.md)
* [Notes for the OpenVMS platform](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-VMS.md)
* [Notes on Perl](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-PERL.md)
* [Notes on Valgrind](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-VALGRIND.md)

Specific notes on upgrading to OpenSSL 3.x from previous versions can be found
in the [ossl-guide-migration(7ossl)](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/ossl-guide-migration.html "OpenSSL Migration Guide") manual page.

Are you talking about the SSH target?

If so, the realistic scenario is a user with legitimate credentials
logging into a server to steal the DSA host key locally with cache
timings.

I don't think client-side enters into the equation for this vuln. You
need an active attacker initiating handshakes. That's my 2c -- we
didn't consider client-side victim much in this work.

If it's the TLS target, you need local access or manage to co-locate
in cloud scenarios. Not as realistic as the SSH case IMO.

# [R2] LCE 4.8.2 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

LCE 4.8.1 is possibly impacted by multiple vulnerabilities reported in third-party libraries. Tenable has not investigated each one to determine if it is exploitable or the vulnerable code path can be reached. Instead, Dev has upgraded the impacted libraries as a faster and safer alternative. Due to the number of library upgrades and the potential for any of these issues to impact LCE users, we strongly encourage you to upgrade. In some cases, older versions than 4.8.0 may be impacted by a subset of these issues.

The following vulnerabilities have been resolved with the updated libraries. Note that several of these issues do not have a CVE assigned.

* SQLite ATTACH / DETACH Statement Handling NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* curl IDNA Puny Code Translation Incorrect Host Resolution Weakness
* curl tool\_urlglob.c Globbing Feature Out-of-bounds Access Issues
* curl lib/escape.c curl\_easy\_unescape() Function URL Unescape Integer Truncation Heap Buffer Overflow
* curl lib/url.c ConnectionExists() Function Connection Reuse Case-insensitive Password Comparison Remote Weakness
* curl lib/parsedate.c parsedate() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* curl lib/cookie.c Shared Cookies Handling Use-after-free Information Disclosure
* curl lib/mprintf.c alloc\_addbyter() Function Double-free DoS
* curl lib/url.c parseurlandfillconn() Function Authority Component Invalid URL Parsing Host Connection Issue
* curl lib/cookie.c Curl\_cookie\_init() Function Arbitrary Cookie Injection
* curl lib/security.c read\_data() Function Kerberos Authentication Handling Double-free Unspecified Issue
* curl lib/base64.c base64\_encode() Function Integer Overflow Heap Buffer Overflow
* curl lib/escape.c Multiple Functions String Length Handling Integer Overflow Heap Buffer Overflow
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the cURL / libcurl integration into LCE and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact LCE at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that LCE be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Log Correlation Engine (LCE) 4.8.2 has been released, which updates the linked OpenSSL, cURL / libcurl, and SQLite libraries. The new version [can be obtained on the Tenable Support Portal](https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=180).

The only low part here appears to be the number of samples needed for a full recovery.
Are we sure that a "low" rating is justified?
DSA is basically dead, until the constant time switch is flicked. The only countermeasure so far is turning it off.

Thx,
Roman.

Subject: Re: CVE-2016-2178: OpenSSL DSA follows a non-constant
 time codepath for certain operations

Whilst there is a commit in openssl and a CVE ID, I wonder why this hasn't
been announced yet by OpenSSL.org and why there are no official fix
releases (yet).
What made this issue different to the usual coordinated disclosures being
practiced with the OpenSSL team?

Security updates for all active release lines, September 2016
## [*(Update 27-September-2016)* Releases available](#update-27-september-2016-releases-available)

Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. These include the recently published versions of OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 as well as fixes for some Node.js-specific security-related defects.

The OpenSSL security fixes included in these updates that impact Node.js are:

* [CVE-2016-6304](#CVE-2016-6304): "OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth"
* [CVE-2016-2183](#CVE-2016-2183): "SWEET32 Mitigation"
* [CVE-2016-6303](#CVE-2016-6303): "OOB write in MDC2\_Update()"
* [CVE-2016-2178](#CVE-2016-2178): "Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing"
* [CVE-2016-6306](#CVE-2016-6306): "Certificate message OOB reads"

Details on each of these can be found in the original post below.

Additionally, OpenSSL 1.0.2j was released yesterday and included a fix for [CVE-2016-7052](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-7052). This flaw was introduced in last week's 1.0.2i release, and therefore does not directly impact Node.js.

## [Node.js-specific security flaws](#nodejs-specific-security-flaws)

Also included, are a number of fixes unrelated to the recent OpenSSL releases.

### [CVE-2016-7099: Wildcard certificates not properly validated](#cve-2016-7099-wildcard-certificates-not-properly-validated)

This is a high severity defect that would allow a malicious TLS server to serve an invalid wildcard certificate for its hostname and be improperly validated by a Node.js client. This is due to a flaw in the validation of `*.` in the wildcard name string.

Originally reported by Alexander Minozhenko and James Bunton (Atlassian).

All versions of Node.js are **affected**.

### [CVE-2016-5325: `reason` argument in `ServerResponse#writeHead()` not properly validated](#cve-2016-5325-reason-argument-in-serverresponsewritehead-not-properly-validated)

This is a low severity security defect that may make [HTTP response splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting) possible under certain circumstances. If user-input is passed to the `reason` argument to `writeHead()` on an HTTP response, a new-line character may be used to inject additional responses.

The fix for this defect introduces a new case where `throw` may occur when configuring HTTP responses. Users should already be adopting try/catch here.

This was originally reported independently by Evan Lucas and Romain Gaucher.

All versions of Node.js are **affected**.

### [Remove support for loading dynamic third-party engine modules](#remove-support-for-loading-dynamic-third-party-engine-modules)

This is a low severity security defect. By default, OpenSSL will load a list of third-party engine modules when the `ENGINE_load_builtin_engines()` function is used. These are normally not present on a user's system. An attacker may be able to make Node.js load malicious code by masquerading it as one of the dynamic engine modules.

This defect primarily impacts Windows due to the standard DLL search paths. However, Unix users may also be at risk with a poorly configured `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable or /etc/ld.so.conf path list.

Originally reported by Ahmed Zaki (Skype).

* Node.js v6 (Current) ***is affected***
* Node.js v4 (LTS "Argon") ***is affected***
* Node.js v0.12 (Maintenance) ***is affected***
* Node.js v0.10 (Maintenance) ***is not affected***

### [Downloads](#downloads)

* [Node.js v6.7.0](/en/blog/release/v6.7.0/)
* [Node.js v4.6.0 (LTS "Argon")](/en/blog/release/v4.6.0/)
* [Node.js v0.12.16 (Maintenance)](/en/blog/release/v0.12.16/)
* [Node.js v0.10.47 (Maintenance)](/en/blog/release/v0.10.47/)

Please note that this may be the final release of the v0.10 line as support ends in October. Please upgrade to v4 or above if you have not already done so.

***Original post is included below***

---

The Node.js project has scheduled updates for all of its active release lines to patch a number of security flaws. These flaws include some of those [announced](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt) by the OpenSSL project as well as a number of Node.js-specific issues. We do not consider any of these updates to be critical. However, it is strongly recommended that all production instances of Node.js be upgraded when the releases are made available.

We intend to make releases available on or soon after the evening of **Tuesday, the 27th of September, 2016, UTC** (midday US time).

We consider some of the patches in these releases to be API *breaking* changes which would normally warrant an increase in the major-version number of Node.js. However, in accordance with our security procedures, we will be delivering these changes in minor-version increases (the *y* in *x.y.z*) where appropriate, and patch-version increases in v0.10 an v0.12 releases.

These are the expected version numbers for the releases:

* Node.js v6.7.0 (Current)
* Node.js v4.6.0 (LTS "Argon")
* Node.js v0.12.16 (Maintenance)
* Node.js v0.10.47 (Maintenance)

Additional notes:

* As per our [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS), support for Node.js v0.10 will cease in October. Therefore, this may be the final release of Node.js v0.10. If you are still using v0.10 in production, it is essential that you plan for a migration to v4 (LTS "Argon") or v6 (LTS to be announced in October) as soon as possible.
* In accordance with our security release procedures, we will be limiting changes included in the LTS and Maintenance lines (v4, v0.12, and v0.10) *for these updates* to only security-related and other critical fixes that provide for maximum stability for users.

## [Node.js-specific security flaws](#nodejs-specific-security-flaws-1)

Included in these releases will be a number of fixes unrelated to the recent OpenSSL releases. These include:

* A high-severity flaw relating to the processing of TLS certificates, impacting all versions of Node.js
* A low-severity native code injection vulnerability on Windows, impacting all versions of Node.js
* A low-severity HTTP validation error, impacting all versions of Node.js

Full disclosure of fixed vulnerabilities will be provided after all releases are made available for download.

## [September OpenSSL Releases](#september-openssl-releases)

The OpenSSL project has [announced](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt) the general availability of versions [1.0.2i](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.0.2-notes.html) (to be included in Node.js v4 and above) and [1.0.1u](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.0.1-notes.html) (to be included in Node.js v0.10 and v0.12). Our crypto team (Shigeki Ohtsu, Fedor Indutny, and Ben Noordhuis) have performed an analysis of the defects addressed in the OpenSSL releases to determine their impact on Node.js. The results of this analysis are included below.

### [[CVE-2016-6304](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6304): OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth](#cve-2016-6304-ocsp-status-request-extension-unbounded-memory-growth)

A malicious client can exhaust a server's memory, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) by sending very large OCSP Status Request extensions in a single session.

This flaw is labelled *high* severity due to the ease of use for a DoS attack and Node.js servers using TLS are vulnerable.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6305](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6305): SSL\_peek() hang on empty record](#cve-2016-6305-ssl_peek-hang-on-empty-record)

OpenSSL 1.1.0 SSL/TLS will hang during a call to `SSL_peek()` if the peer sends an empty record.

Node.js is not yet dependent on OpenSSL 1.1.0 so it is not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2183](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2183): SWEET32 Mitigation](#cve-2016-2183-sweet32-mitigation)

[SWEET32](https://sweet32.info) is a new attack on older block cipher algorithms that use a block size of 64 bits.

As mitigation, OpenSSL has moved DES-based ciphers from the `HIGH` to `MEDIUM` group. As Node.js includes `HIGH`, but not `MEDIUM`, in its default suite, affected ciphers are no longer included unless the default suite is not used. Node's default TLS cipher suite can be found in the [API documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_modifying_the_default_tls_cipher_suite).

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6303](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6303): OOB write in MDC2\_Update()](#cve-2016-6303-oob-write-in-mdc2_update)

An overflow can occur in `MDC2_Update()` under certain circumstances resulting in an out of bounds (OOB) error. This attack is impractical on most platforms due to the size of data required to trigger the OOB error.

Node.js is impacted by this flaw but due to the impracticalities of exploiting it and the very low usage of MDC-2, it is *very low* severity for Node.js users.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6302](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6302): Malformed SHA512 ticket DoS](#cve-2016-6302-malformed-sha512-ticket-dos)

If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC, it is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack via crash upon receiving a malformed ticket.

Node.js does not use SHA512 for session tickets and is therefore not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2182](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2182): OOB write in BN\_bn2dec()](#cve-2016-2182-oob-write-in-bn_bn2dec)

An out of bounds (OOB) write can occur in `BN_bn2dec()` if an application uses this function with an overly large `BIGNUM`. TLS is not affected because record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2180](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2180): OOB read in TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio()](#cve-2016-2180-oob-read-in-ts_obj_print_bio)

An out of bounds (OOB) read can occur when large OIDs are presented via `TS_OBJ_print_bio()`.

Node.js does not make use of the Time Stamp Authority functionality in OpenSSL and is therefore believed to be unaffected by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2177](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2177): Pointer arithmetic undefined behavior](#cve-2016-2177-pointer-arithmetic-undefined-behavior)

This programming flaw is described in the post at <https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/06/27/undefined-pointer-arithmetic/>.

It is unlikely that Node.js users are directly impacted by this.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2178](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2178): Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing](#cve-2016-2178-constant-time-flag-not-preserved-in-dsa-signing)

A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.

This is *very low* severity for Node.js users due to the difficulty in taking advantage of this attack and because DSA is very rarely used.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2179](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2179): DTLS buffered message DoS](#cve-2016-2179-dtls-buffered-message-dos)

In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order, those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.

As Node.js does not support DTLS, users are not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-2179](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-2179): DTLS replay protection DoS](#cve-2016-2179-dtls-replay-protection-dos)

A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism that would allow an attacker to force a server to drop legitimate packets for a DTLS connection, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) for that connection.

As Node.js does not support DTLS, users are not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6306](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6306): Certificate message OOB reads](#cve-2016-6306-certificate-message-oob-reads)

Some missing message length checks can result in out of bounds (OOB) reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical denial of service (DoS) risk. This only impacts a client or a server which enables client authentication.

Node.js is impacted by this *low* severity flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are **affected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6307](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6307): Excessive allocation of memory in tls\_get\_message\_header()](#cve-2016-6307-excessive-allocation-of-memory-in-tls_get_message_header)

Excessive allocation of memory in OpenSSL 1.1.0 can be achieved by manipulating the length component of a TLS header.

Node.js is not yet dependent on OpenSSL 1.1.0 so it is not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

### [[CVE-2016-6308](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-6308): Excessive allocation of memory in dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment()](#cve-2016-6308-excessive-allocation-of-memory-in-dtls1_preprocess_fragment)

A flaw that is similar to CVE-2016-6307 but impacting DTLS.

Node.js is not yet dependent on OpenSSL 1.1.0, nor does it implement DTLS, so it is not impacted by this flaw.

**Assessment**: All versions of Node.js are believed to be **unaffected** by this vulnerability.

Orion Elite Hidden IP Browser Pro++ - Multiple Known Vulnerabilities
(Formerly known as: Torion Secure Anonymous Browser Pro++)
Versions affected:
7.9 (02 May 2016) and all former versions dating back to 1.0 (10 August 2015)
iPhone App Info - Description by Developer:
"#1 Onion Routing Browser that protects and hides your IP (Internet Protocol) address from
the internet for legal legitimate purposes. It is the most robust, tested and popular App on the
App Store. Is your privacy worth cutting corners? Can you be half protected? Is it worth the
risk? The world famous eVestigator.com.au, the Cyber Digital-Forensics Private Investigator,
the author and enhancer of this original open browser says "not even he could hack it" and
"I have put people behind bars just from tracing an IP before". That's straight from the Author.
If you're thinking about investigating in an inferior product, think again!"

Special Thanks: The original developer (see references) for providing accurate changelogs and making known bugs public,
so that users are aware of these security risks.
-:: The Advisory - Detailed::-
The iPhone application reviewed is vulnerable to multiple known issues.
1. The Tor client embedded within the application is: 0.2.6.5-rc (released 18 Mar 2015)
Relevant changelogs:
- <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/ReleaseNotes?h=release-0.2.6>
(<https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0265-rc-released>)
- Potentially Applicable CVEs:
CVE-2017-0376, CVE-2017-0375, CVE-2016-8860
2. The OpenSSL library embedded within the application is: 1.0.2a (released 19 Mar 2015)
Relevant changelogs:
- <https://openssl.org/news/changelog.html>
- <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt> << Important security advisory
- <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt> << Important security advisory
- Applicable CVEs:
CVE-2017-3731, CVE-2017-3732, CVE-2016-7055, CVE-2016-7052, CVE-2016-6304, CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6303
CVE-2016-6302, CVE-2016-2182, CVE-2016-2180, CVE-2016-2177, CVE-2016-2178, CVE-2016-2179, CVE-2016-2181
CVE-2016-6306, CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2109, CVE-2016-2176, CVE-2016-0800
CVE-2016-0705, CVE-2016-0798, CVE-2016-0797, CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-0702, CVE-2016-0701, CVE-2015-3197
CVE-2015-3193, CVE-2015-3194, CVE-2015-3195, CVE-2015-1793, CVE-2015-3196
3. Known bugs from the original application, by the original developer:
- Video note: Websites using HTML5 <video> tags may leak <video>-related DNS queries and data transfer outside
of Tor. This includes YouTube, Vimeo, and any website using iOS-compatible HTML5 video. This is due to behavior
of the embedded QuickTime player and a comprehensive workaround has not yet been developed.
- JavaScript blocking: The "Active Content Blocking" feature is experimental. If ACB is turned off, JavaScript
techniques can identify what type of iOS device you are using and what version of iOS you are using, even if
User-Agent Spoofing is enabled.
- Geolocation blocking: Websites may use the HTML5 Geolocation API unless the "Active Content Blocking" feature
is set to "Block All". Users should remain vigilant for any pop-ups asking for permission to access location data.
Note: Please refer to the references further below, i.e. "Known Bugs".
4. The application also sends the following HTTP request on startup to the developers website:
<http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/ip34r.asp?guid=><INSERT GUID HERE>
An example of this can be seen below:
GET /secure/ip34r.asp?guid=<INSERT GUID HERE>&new=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.orionbrowser.com
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: close
Pragma: no-cache
User-Agent: OrionBrowser/<VERSION HERE> CFNetwork/<VERSION HERE> Darwin/<VERSION HERE>
According to the developer, this is to check that the application is licensed, by sending a unique GUID over HTTP that
can be tracked, every time the application is run.
5. In addition to the above, several other links are hardcoded to use HTTP:
__cstring:001B912A 00000033 C <http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/ip34r.asp?guid=>
__cstring:001B9443 00000028 C <http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/?tk=>
__cstring:001B94C5 0000003F C window.location.href='[http://orionbrowser.com/secure/top.asp'](http://orionbrowser.com/secure/top.asp%26apos);;
__cstring:001B9504 00000042 C window.location.href='[http://orionbrowser.com/secure/bottom.asp'](http://orionbrowser.com/secure/bottom.asp%26apos);;
__cstring:001B9546 00000040 C window.location.href='[http://orionbrowser.com/secure/menu.asp'](http://orionbrowser.com/secure/menu.asp%26apos);;
__cstring:001B971D 00000037 C <http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/bookmark.asp?title=>
__cstring:001B9980 00000026 C <http://www.orionbrowser.com/help.html>
__cstring:001BBA84 0000001D C <http://www.orionbrowser.com/>
__cstring:001BBB27 00000027 C <http://www.orionbrowser.com/opensource>
6. Several embedded HTML files within the application, will also redirect to the developer's website over HTTP:
a.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2; URL='[http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/a.html"](http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/a.html%22); />
about.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='[http://www.orionbrowser.com/"](http://www.orionbrowser.com/%22); />
bookmark.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='[http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/bookmark.asp"](http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/bookmark.asp%22); />
help.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='[http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure"](http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure%22); />
startup.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='[http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure"](http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure%22); />
status.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='[http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/status.html"](http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/status.html%22); />
7. The current version of this iPhone app does not use "HashedControlPassword" within the TorRC file either.
-:: Proof of Concept ::-
The current version of this iPhone application appears to be broken, and has likely been broken for a few months.
When the app starts up, it expects the developer's domain to provide a specific response over plain-text HTTP. The
first request made to the developer's website is vulnerable to MITM attacks before it crashes.
-:: Solution ::-
1. The embedded OpenSSL library must be updated to the latest version.
2. The embedded Tor client within the application, must be updated to the latest secure version.
3. Users must be notified of known bugs - See references further below.
4. All connections made to the developer's website must be over HTTPS.
5. The application should NOT send a unique GUID to the developer's website when it runs.
6. The application should NOT allow the user to save bookmarks on the developer's website.
It is STRONGLY advised to uninstall this iPhone application immediately, if you have it installed on your phone.

The paper very resourceful, and thank you for sharing your thoughts
even beyond it!

Control over CPU utilization (and thereby cache eviction) can be achieved
by a remote attacker: Web applications are influenced remotely by
definition, and they are far from slim or localized these days.
Keepalives allow to keep the system in a sling with predictable resource
utilization including cache fills, as there is not only just data stuffed
through some buffers.

The question remains if the deterioration of the SNR (*) leaves enough
resolution to be useful. This would no longer constitute a cache-based
attack with the terrifyingly clear signal, but the sharp edges in the
latency that you have demonstrated may contribute to filtering the effect
from the noise.
While the cause - non-constant-time implementation - remains.

Are the orders of magnitude in range?

(*):
-: network jitter, uncontrolled task concurrency
+: NIC offloading functions, cache coherency artefacts with multi
threaded apps, carefully chosen timing between cache eviction activity
and latency measurement of responses.

Subject: Re: CVE-2016-2178: OpenSSL DSA follows a non-constant
 time codepath for certain operations

... which would be a different rating to the "moderate" that the RedHat
team ended up with: <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2178>
I agree that both ratings are reasonable; so still awaiting for the OpenSSL
announcement at least in the vulnerability section (
<https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#y2016>).
(Could be that I am just too impatient ;-)

# USN-3087-2: OpenSSL regression

23 September 2016

USN-3087-1 introduced a regression in OpenSSL.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

USN-3087-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The fix for [CVE-2016-2182](/security/CVE-2016-2182) was

incomplete and caused a regression when parsing certificates. This update

fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request

extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory

consumption, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6304](/security/CVE-2016-6304))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when

performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update.

([CVE-2016-2177](/security/CVE-2016-2177))

César Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL

did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing

attack and recover private DSA keys. ([CVE-2016-2178](/security/CVE-2016-2178))

Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime

of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of

service. ([CVE-2016-2179](/security/CVE-2016-2179))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the

TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2180](/security/CVE-2016-2180))

It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay

feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2016-2181](/security/CVE-2016-2181))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-2182](/security/CVE-2016-2182))

Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES

ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could

possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted

sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM.

([CVE-2016-2183](/security/CVE-2016-2183))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths.

A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-6302](/security/CVE-2016-6302))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the

MDC2\_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6303](/security/CVE-2016-6303))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message

length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6306](/security/CVE-2016-6306))

Maybe I should be a little more verbose on this:
1) attacker recovers the DSA host key.
2) attacker mitm-attacks client connections to the server and recovers the user's private key by exploiting the vulnerable openssl on the client side
3) ...

The same principles apply when the computational burden is reversed for client auth, aren't they?

## Security Advisory 0024 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1749-security-advisory-24?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** October 4th, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | October 4th, 2016 | Initial release |

**Arista Products vulnerability report for security vulnerabilities announcement from the OpenSSL project on September 22nd, 2016**

**Product: EOS and CloudVision eXchange**

These products are not vulnerable to the following

* CVE-2016-6305 (SSL\_peek() hang on empty record)
* CVE-2016-6303 (OOB write in MDC2\_Update())
* CVE-2016-6302 (Malformed SHA512 ticket DoS)
* CVE-2016-2182 (OOB write in BN\_bn2dec())
* CVE-2016-2180 (OOB read in TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio())
* CVE-2016-2177 (Pointer arithmetic undefined behaviour)
* CVE-2016-2181 (DTLS replay protection DoS)
* CVE-2016-6306 (Certificate message OOB reads)
* CVE-2016-6307 (Excessive allocation of memory in tls\_get\_message\_header())
* CVE-2016-6308 (Excessive allocation of memory in dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment())

EOS and CloudVision eXchange are vulnerable to the following:

* CVE-2016-6304 (OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth)

+ **Affected Software versions:** EOS-4.17.0F, 4.17.1F, 4.17.1.1F, 4.17.1FX-VRRP6LL
+ **CVSS Scores:**

- CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.5 (High)
- CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (High)

+ **Affected Features:** eAPI, CVX HA, VMtracer
+ **Impact**: A malicious attacker could cause a server that uses SSL (in this case EOS or CloudVision eXchange running the affected features) to run out of memory and have the service be rendered temporarily unavailable as a result. The switch or the VM would then come back, in about a minute or so, though repeated attacks could potentially increase the time before the service starts up again.
+ **Mitigation**: Use control plane ACLs to limit only known, secure devices to connect to the affected services.
+ **Resolution**: Bug 171788 tracks this issue and the fix will be available in the next version of supported EOS release trains.

* CVE-2016-2183 (SWEET32 Mitigation)

+ **Affected Software versions:** Table-1 documents the affected EOS releases
+ **CVSS Scores:**

- CVSS v3 Base Score: 5.3 (Medium)
- CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (Medium)

+ **Affected Features:** CVX (OVSDB Connections) (Client), EOS copy command (Client), XMPP (Client)
+ **Impact**: To exploit this vulnerability both the OpenSSL server and client have to use 3DES to encrypt data over SSL. Only after 32GB have been transferred, the attacker can begin to decrypt data.
+ **Mitigation**: All affected features are SSL clients. To mitigate the issue, the SSL server that the clients are connecting to should not use the 3DES cipher.
+ **Resolution**: Bug 167755 tracks this issue and the fix will be available in the next version of supported EOS release trains.

* CVE-2016-2178 (Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing)

+ **Affected Software versions**: Table-1 documents the affected EOS releases
+ **CVSS Scores**:

- CVSS v3 Base Score: 5.5 (Medium)
- CVSS v2 Base Score: 2.1 (Low)

+ **Affected Features:** SSH
+ **Impact**: This vulnerability can allow an attacker to recover the DSA private key under certain conditions. Since SSH supports DSA as an option, this can allow the attacker to recover the DSA key used on an sshd server.
+ **Mitigation**: It is recommended not to use DSA as a hostkey in the SSH server (i.e. on the switches or VMs running affected EOS versions)
+ **Resolution**: Bug 171791 tracks this issue and the fix will be available in the next version of supported EOS release trains.

**AFFECTED EOS RELEASES:**

# CVE-2016-2179

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-2178.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-2180.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-2179 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2179)

#### Description

The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries associated with unused out-of-order messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, related to d1\_lib.c, statem\_dtls.c, statem\_lib.c, and statem\_srvr.c.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
0. Revision history
v1.0 2016-09-23 Initial release.
v1.1 2016-09-26 Revised patch to address a regression in CVE-2016-2182 fix.
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension.
If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status
Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the
server. [CVE-2016-6304]
An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or through
the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply
very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate()
with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap
corruption. [CVE-2016-6303]
If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a
DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will
ultimately crash. [CVE-2016-6302]
The function BN\_bn2dec() does not check the return value of BN\_div\_word().
This can cause an OOB write if an application uses this function with an
overly large BIGNUM. This could be a problem if an overly large certificate
or CRL is printed out from an untrusted source. TLS is not affected because
record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.
[CVE-2016-2182]
The function TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() misuses OBJ\_obj2txt(): the return value is
the total length the OID text representation would use and not the amount
of data written. This will result in OOB reads when large OIDs are presented.
[CVE-2016-2180]
Some calculations of limits in OpenSSL have used undefined pointer arithmetic.
This could cause problems with some malloc implementations. [CVE-2016-2177]
Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to
avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that
a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. [CVE-2016-2178]
In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those
messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later
use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages
do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed.
An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when
they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS
connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore
the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection.
[CVE-2016-2179]
A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that
arrive for future epochs update the replay protection "window" before the MAC
for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by
sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a
valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent
legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific
DTLS connection. [CVE-2016-2181]
In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in
OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical
DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms.
[CVE-2016-6306]
III. Impact
A remote attacker can cause OpenSSL server, regardless whether OCSP is supported,
to have unbounded memory growth, and eventually lead to a Denial of Service.
[CVE-2016-6304]
If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous
call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow
resulting in a heap corruption. [CVE-2016-6303]
An attacker who can send a malformed ticket to the server can cause an OOB read
which will ultimately lead to a crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.
[CVE-2016-6302]
A local attacker can cause an application that parses overly large certificate or
CRL to crash. TLS is not affected. [CVE-2016-2182]
A local attacker who can create a specially-crafted time stamp file and pass it
through the "ts" command of openssl(1) can cause it to crash. This functionality
is not used by the SSL/TLS implementation. [CVE-2016-2180]
Some OpenSSL code is questionable to integer overflow, which may lead to heap
corruption. [CVE-2016-2177]
An attacker may recover the private DSA key by conducting timing attack.
[CVE-2016-2178]
A remote attacker may cause a DTLS server to exhaust memory, resulting in a
Denial of Service. [CVE-2016-2179]
A remote attacker who can send DTLS records can cause the server to drop all
subsequent packets for a specific connection. [CVE-2016-2181]
A remote attacker can, in theory, cause OOB reads if the server enabled client
authentication. [CVE-2016-6306]
IV. Workaround

Subject: CVE-2016-2178: OpenSSL DSA follows a non-constant time codepath for certain operations

Hi,

Just off Twitter:

<mjos_crypto> Out today: This is the OpenSSL side-channel vulnerability I mentioned last week; now on ePrint. Also CVE-2016-2178. <http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/594>
<@mjos_crypto> @mjos_crypto Currently unfixed in essentially all distros.
<mjos_crypto> Note that CVE-2016-2178 / <http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/594.pdf> most severely actually impacts OpenSSH, which uses the OpenSSL library.
<mjos_crypto> Cesar's CVE-2016-2178 patch for the OpenSSL library from Monday. <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=399944622df7bd81af62e67ea967c470534090e2>

| "Make Sure DSA Signing Exponentiations Really are Constant-Time''
|
| Cesar Pereida Garca and Billy Bob Brumley and Yuval Yarom
|
| Abstract: TLS and SSH are two of the most commonly used protocols for securing Internet traffic. Many of the implementations of these protocols rely on the cryptographic primitives provided in the OpenSSL library. In this work we disclose a vulnerability in OpenSSL, affecting all versions and forks (e.g. LibreSSL and BoringSSL) since roughly October 2005, which renders the implementation of the DSA signature scheme vulnerable to cache-based side-channel attacks. Exploiting the software defect, we demonstrate the first published cache-based key-recovery attack on these protocols: 260 SSH-2 handshakes to extract a 1024/160-bit DSA host key from an OpenSSH server, and 580 TLS 1.2 handshakes to extract a 2048/256-bit DSA key from an stunnel server.

| Fix DSA, preserve BN_FLG_CONSTTIME
|
| Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in
| order to avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA
| implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for
| certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing
| attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-20 08:10:27 UTC  ``` Quoting form the draft of the OpenSSL upstream advisory:  OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth ([CVE-2016-6304](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6304)) =====================================================================  Severity: High  A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the "no-ocsp" build time option are not affected.  OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0a OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 29th August 2016 by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.). The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-20 08:10:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the OpenSSL project Upstream: Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-20 08:11:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1202766](attachment.cgi?id=1202766&action=diff "OpenSSL upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1202766&action=edit "OpenSSL upstream fix") OpenSSL upstream fix   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-20 08:12:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1202768](attachment.cgi?id=1202768&action=diff "OpenSSL upstream fix for 1.1.0") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1202768&action=edit "OpenSSL upstream fix for 1.1.0") OpenSSL upstream fix for 1.1.0   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-20 08:16:05 UTC  ``` This flaw is in the code that handles status_request TLS extension (RFC 4366, RFC 6066).  The support for this extension was introduced upstream in version 0.9.8h, therefore openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier were not affected as they did not include the affected code.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-20 13:22:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c0)) > Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do > not support OCSP.  This statement does not apply to older OpenSSL versions.  Previously, parsing of status_request TLS extension only happened if application using OpenSSL provided tlsext_status_cb callback function.  The behaviour changed in response to this upstream bug report:  <https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3178&user=guest&pass=guest> <https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=eb85ee9a8867b605cd7fb427869d0e50caa80a3f>  In 1.0.1 branch, this change was introduced in version 1.0.1g. The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are based on upstream version 1.0.1e and require callback to be set to perform status_request extension parsing.  Therefore, this flaw can only be triggered for applications that explicitly enable OCSP stapling support.  That functionality does not seem to be widely used in server applications using OpenSSL.  Web servers as httpd (2.4) and nginx allow users to enable stapling support, but don't do that by default:  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslusestapling> <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_stapling>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-21 21:36:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1203520](attachment.cgi?id=1203520&action=diff "Updated OpenSSL upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1203520&action=edit "Updated OpenSSL upstream fix") Updated OpenSSL upstream fix   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1377600#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-22 10:58:27 UTC  ``` Public now via upstream advisory.

#### Description

The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.
