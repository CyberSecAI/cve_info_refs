- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated attacker with special permissions can craft a script on the server that will cause processes to run on a remote UCD agent machine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper access control on script execution, allowing the execution of crafted scripts on remote agents.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on remote UCD agent machines, with the potential for data compromise and system takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based, by crafting malicious scripts on the server component of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user with special permissions to craft scripts on the server.
