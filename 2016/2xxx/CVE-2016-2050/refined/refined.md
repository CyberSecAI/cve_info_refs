Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write error in the `libdwarf` library, specifically within the `get_abbrev_array_info` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Out-of-bounds write:** The `get_abbrev_array_info` function attempts to write data to a memory location outside of the allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Memory corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt adjacent memory, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potentially, arbitrary code execution. The valgrind output indicates an invalid write of size 8 bytes, into a large unallocated memory block.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted ELF file. In this specific case, the ELF file `aw.elf` is provided as a test case.
-   The attack vector would be an attacker crafting a malicious ELF file and then have a user or system attempt to process the file with `dwarfdump` which uses `libdwarf`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted ELF file to an application that uses the vulnerable `libdwarf` library (e.g. `dwarfdump`).
-   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability, but would require access to a system or application that attempts to process the malicious ELF.
