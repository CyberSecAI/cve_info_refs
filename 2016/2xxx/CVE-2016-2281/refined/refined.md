- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ABB Panel Builder 800 Version 5.1 application is vulnerable to a DLL hijacking issue. When the application attempts to load a DLL without specifying the full path, Windows searches for the DLL in various locations, including the application's directory. An attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious DLL with the same name in a location where Windows will find it before the legitimate DLL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427). The application does not specify the full path to DLLs, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to insert and run arbitrary code on the affected system. This could result in complete system compromise, including data theft, system disruption, and further propagation of malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a specific location on the file system where the Panel Builder 800 Version 5.1 application is used. The user must then execute the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine to place the malicious DLL and must rely on user interaction to launch the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be a privileged user.
