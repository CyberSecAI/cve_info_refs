Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-2102

**Root Cause:**
The HAProxy statistics interface was configured to be accessible over the network without any authentication.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of Authentication: The primary vulnerability is the absence of authentication for the HAProxy statistics interface.
- Network Exposure: This interface is exposed over the network, making it remotely accessible to potential attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could gain access to sensitive information related to HAProxy's performance, such as:
- Server status
- Traffic statistics
- Performance metrics
- Potentially other internal details.

This information could be used to plan further attacks, cause denial of service, or gain deeper access into the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: The vulnerability is exploited by accessing the HAProxy statistics port over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to reach the port where the HAProxy statistics are exposed. This could be through the local network or if the port is exposed to the internet.
- No Authentication Required: No authentication is needed, meaning an attacker can access the statistics directly.
