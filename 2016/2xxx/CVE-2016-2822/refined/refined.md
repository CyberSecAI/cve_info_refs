Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla Firefox handles the `<select>` HTML element, specifically when it contains a persistent menu. This menu can act as a container for arbitrary HTML content and be positioned in a way that it overlaps the address bar.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The ability to place arbitrary HTML content over the address bar allows a malicious website to mask the true URL of the site, potentially leading users to believe they are on a legitimate website. This bypasses the Same Origin Policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing Attacks:** A malicious website can display a fake URL in the address bar, leading users to believe they are on a trusted site, potentially leading to phishing or other social engineering attacks.
*   **Clickjacking:** With an address bar covered by a malicious element, a user might unintentionally click on other elements displayed by the attacker, such as those for WebRTC dialogs that are often used in webcam hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is launched through a crafted web page that a user would have to access via a browser.
*   **User Interaction:** The user is required to open the malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be a remote user controlling a malicious server.
*   **Crafted Web Page:** The attacker needs the ability to create a web page with a specific structure using a persistent menu within a `<select>` element to overlap the address bar.
*   **Social Engineering:** Some form of social engineering to lure the user into opening the malicious website is necessary.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a regression caused by a previous change made to the `<select>` element, and is considered a medium severity vulnerability with low likelihood of exploitation
*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that select dropdown menus cannot overlap the address bar.
*   A related issue was discovered for e10s mode and was tracked in [bug 1276976](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1276976).
*   The persistent menu aspect led to additional issues like clickjacking.
*  RedHat notes the CVSS v2 score is 4.3(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N). SUSE gives it a 4.3 as well but notes a CVSS v2 vector of  AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N .
*  SUSE notes the CVSS v3 score is 6.5 with vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

In summary, CVE-2016-2822 allows a remote attacker to spoof the address bar in Mozilla Firefox using a specially crafted web page. This can be used to deceive users, which could potentially lead to a further compromise.
