Package        : icedove
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2806

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird. Support
for the 38.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 45.x releases.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:45.1.0-1~deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:45.1.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:45.1.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [oxygen-gtk3](/security/cves?package=oxygen-gtk3) - Oxygen widget theme for GTK3-based applications

## Details

USN-2936-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update caused Firefox to

crash on startup with the Oxygen GTK theme due to a pre-existing bug in

the Oxygen-GTK3 theme engine. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Christian Holler, Tyson Smith, Phil Ringalda, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman,

Mats Palmgren, Carsten Book, Boris Zbarsky, David Bolter, Randell Jesup,

Andrew McCreight, and Steve Fink discovered multiple memory safety issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2804](/security/CVE-2016-2804), [CVE-2016-2806](/security/CVE-2016-2806),

[CVE-2016-2807](/security/CVE-2016-2807))

An invalid write was discovered when using the JavaScript .watch() method in

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2808](/security/CVE-2016-2808))

Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free and buffer overflow in service

workers. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2811](/security/CVE-2016-2811), [CVE-2016-2812](/security/CVE-2016-2812))

Sascha Just discovered a buffer overflow in libstagefright in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2814](/security/CVE-2016-2814))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that CSP is not applied correctly to web

content sent with the multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks when they would otherwise be prevented. ([CVE-2016-2816](/security/CVE-2016-2816))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that the chrome.tabs.update API for web

extensions allows for navigation to javascript: URLs. A malicious

extension could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-2817](/security/CVE-2016-2817))

Mark Goodwin discovered that about:healthreport accepts certain events

from any content present in the remote-report iframe. If another

vulnerability allowed the injection of web content in the remote-report

iframe, an attacker could potentially exploit this to change the user's

sharing preferences. ([CVE-2016-2820](/security/CVE-2016-2820))

Marking this s-s because the assertion doesn't look safe to me. If it depends on TypedObject, it might be Nightly-only.

[bug 1105463](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105463 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement default constructors for ClassDefinitions") is almost certainly not a regressor, here. It just made |class get{}.get++| not a syntax error. Jan has graciously agreed to help me look into this anyway.

OK, I've tracked this down.
We incorrectly set up the stack for callTypeUpdateIC() in several SetProp stubs including TypedObject and Unboxed, which leads to a bogus value in ICTailCallReg, consulted in HandleException after an oom-related failure in DoTypeUpdateFallback.
Jan, do you think we should land tests with this? It seems like it's reasonably easy to get this to happen, and if it does, we'll get the wrong stub there. It seems like the repercussions could be quite bad.
It also seems like this should go to Beta, since ICSetProp\_Unboxed is older and not Nightly-only.Assignee: nobody → efaustbmoStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(efaustbmo)

Fix
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Since we're not gonna land the test immediately, you'd have to be already familiar, and then get pretty lucky.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
41+. This is headed for Aurora47 Beta46 and esr45.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should apply everywhere.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
quite unlikely. Tested locally, and we can let it sit on central for a day or two before uplifting.

Fix
[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined:
Potential possibly exploitable crash with OOM. Incorrect JITCode.
Fix Landed on Version:
Landed cleanly with no visible regressions on 48.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
Changing jitcode always introduces the possibiliy of regressions, but this one is quite small, safe, and intuitive. The failure is quite localized, so I am quite confident this will not provide new risk.
String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None.
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2016-39

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:46.0 / rv:45.1 / rv:38.8)

Announced
April 26, 2016
Reporter
Mozilla Developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 46
* Firefox ESR 38.8
* Firefox ESR 45.1
* Thunderbird 38.8
* Thunderbird 45.1

### Description

Mozilla developers fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least
some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Christian Holler, Tyson Smith, and Phil Ringalda reported memory safety problems and
crashes that are fixed in Firefox ESR 45.1, Firefox ESR 38.8 and Firefox 46.

STR:
Load the attached testcase and click anywhere in the content area. This will open a new window while alert is called in the original window. Close the new window, then proceed to close the alert box in the original window.
The currently release build of firefox crashes usually with an access violation while trying to read from memory address 0xE5E5E5E5. This address originates from the css equivalent( like background: #E5E5E5 ).
I'm currently still trying to find a way to automate the value that ends up there but here's a partial explanation as I understand it so far. To begin with see <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/browser/themes/osx/downloads/downloads.css#46>
Note that some internal browser elements are styled using this, and as the screen renders itself for vertical sync it actually copies the value to memory many times over representing one rendering of that frame.
I'm certain that this is exploitable, I've ran through many iterations manually and twice I have already overwritten what would normally be 0xE5E5E5E5 with a pointer to an address that was accessible. I have also just confirmed that the current release build also crashes in linux in this same situation.
This all originated from some click jacking work I've been doing, and I'm still in the process of that and I have to get to an audit on pocket soon(this took priority obviously once I found it.)
Once I've finished my current work I'll try to complete migrating my linux OS to a full VM setup so I can test and debug in both windows and linux at the same time which will hopefully allow me to get a more complete understanding of exactly what is happening here.

Are you sure the address containing 0xE5E5E5E5 comes from the color value, rather than being coincidental? 0xE5 is the fill pattern jemalloc uses now for freed memory (in older builds we used 0x5a). Adding a link or two from about:crashes is helpful if you have them -- saves QA/devs from having to generate them ourselves.Group: core-security → gfx-core-security

I'm not positive at all. As i said that this is as I understand it currently. I do know that if you do other things that write to memory depending on the timing you will get completely different results.
As I said I've already made it past the normal crash point stepping through in asm twice just doing random things. It crashes a little later, but that's just because I haven't figured out exactly what data is being placed there. If I knew I would have a full exploit written that would run your calculator.
In the DidComposite function apparently it does not attempt to make the call to mTransactionIdAllocator->NotifyTransactionCompleted(aTransactionId) until after you have closed the alert box. So before you close it you can attempt to overwrite the value in memory and as I said I've already successfully overwritten it with an accessible memory location twice which stops the read access violation and triggers DEP in windows when it even attempts to execute the code which should be NotifyTransactionCompleted.
That's all I have currently.

This has me worried, because it's not that hard to find and its in the current release build. I haven't slept in pushing 48 hours now just to get to this point. Maybe I can bring better info to the table later.
It took me some time just to narrow down the pieces of the click jacking testcase I was working on to get this far, sorry I don't have more currently.

I'll try to generate some crashes and post the links to them. Honestly I have crash reporting kind of tweaked as in it's partially enabled(generates dumps but never even tries to submit them).
I don't like things automatically sending data ever. Let me generate some reports and have it submit them so I can get the links from about:crashes.
After that I'm getting some rest and I'll see what you guys have come up with later.

<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/a0cb3a70-375f-4cb8-a226-3f66d2160125>
Note if you view the raw info of the dumps, the value of EDI which would normally be 0xE5E5E5E5 isn't that in either of these dumps. One even has a value that is near to being a valid pointer. The only difference is I did some additional things in the webconsole to make writes to memory before closing the alert box.

The crash stats in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1242668#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Memory corruption in mozilla::layers::ClientLayerManager::DidComposite appears to be exploitable /use after free") look like null derefs. Doesn't mean there isn't a UAF happening, though.

I'm working on a revised testcase right now. It was passing the read access violation and actually getting to the 'call edx' instruction of NotifyTransactionCompleted(if you look at the disassembly).
So far it made it to this instruction 3 out of 5 times at which point DEP kicks in, that's scary and makes me fairly sure this is exploitable. I'll be working on it.
I'm not the best with memory corruption to begin with, and firefox makes things like heap spray harder. I'm still fairly sure this is exploitable and its definitely not just a null pointer deref. If you go through many iterations you will see that the same values aren't even always null pointers.

Yeah I meant to ask, as you explained 0xE5E5E5E5 comes from jemalloc, does anything fill memory with the value 0xE4E4E4E4? It's also common to run into here. I'll look myself soon, I just feel that I'm very close to having something here.
I need a way to leak memory address from JS so I can just forget about bypassing DEP and call into internal functions to run an executable. I probably wont have much luck with that though.

I can't believe nobody is taking this as seriously as me. Here's a screenshot showing that its obviously a use after free. I've seen people just post an ASAN debug output log showing a use after free and people get to it.
In this picture you can clearly see its trying to read a memory location, but the pointer to that location has been freed.
Also this is in the current release that everyone has, appears to be there in linux and windows, and isn't that hard to find.

Here's a screenshot of what I consider proof that this is exploitable. There could be special circumstances in this case, but I think it can be accomplished.

Yes, recent jemalloc uses 0xe4 when it allocates and 0xe5 when it frees, so 0xe4 indicates uninitialized memory.Keywords: [csectype-uaf](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-uaf&resolution=---),

I had already looked into and confirmed this. I also spent more time than I should have looking for any out of bounds read that I could use to try to get the base address of the xul library reliably. I then looked over papers on VUPEN's old work from pwn2own and they have some very interesting techniques for manipulating the internal heaps in firefox.
I eventually had to just let it go as I spent far to much energy on this that could have been used much more efficiently. When it comes to things security related right in front of me I tent to get tunnel vision.

[Keep things alive longer](attachment.cgi?id=8716577&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1242668&attachment=8716577)

Keeping child alive makes sense because we're getting it from a global and there's no guarantee that it will stay alive for the duration of the caller. Fixing this moves the crash to a crash on a disappearing layer manger.
It's not clear to me who's responsibility it is to keep the layer manager alive, but doing so seems to fix the problem.
Overall, I made this fix without any real understanding of what was happening so I have no idea if it makes sense.

I seems to find what triggers the crash. "gBrowser.selectedBrowser.focus()" in browser.js is a trigger of the crash.
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#1190>
In the STR, the focus() takes very long time. It was called just before showing alert and it ended just after alert close. Therefore, if we do not close alert, the focus() does not exit.

It seems that when DidComposite() is called in ClientLayerManager's destructor, widget could be also in destructor :-(

Problem looks similar to [Bug 1242237](/show_bug.cgi?id=1242237 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent mixed-dimentionN.html?margin_parent | image comparison (==), max difference: 255, number of differing pixels: 2800").

By the investigation, the problem seems to be caused by a problem of MozAfterPaint event.
At first, I tried to reproduce the reftest failure, but failed to reproduce it locally. Invalidation failure was caused by reftest's invalidation mechanism. Reftest renders documents to canvas to check tests result and invalidation area come from MozAfterPaint event. There is a case that the event does not have a invalidated area. It caused invalidation problem and resulted to reftest failures.

When reftest invalidate whole document area, the reftest failures were addressed.

In current gecko, MozAfterPaint could be sent when related update is not arrived to LayerManagerComposite. It happens on content process. And in chrome process, reftest tried to render the content to canvas. The rendering to canvas end up to composition in LayerManagerComposite.
There could be a case that the rendering to canvas happen before the content's layers update is delivered to LayerManagerComposite.

I tried to make CompositorChild::RecvDidComposite() exits quickly. It is like [attachment 8718687](/attachment.cgi?id=8718687 "patch - Defter nsAutoScriptBlocker in nsView::DidCompositeWindow()") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8718687&action=edit "patch - Defter nsAutoScriptBlocker in nsView::DidCompositeWindow()") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8718687&action=diff "patch - Defter nsAutoScriptBlocker in nsView::DidCompositeWindow()") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1242668&attachment=8718687). But it seems to cause tryserver failure. The patch changed the timing of the function calls. It seems to hit another problems. It seems not easy to address them.
From the above, in this bug, it seems better just to address the crash. It seems simpler.

It seems better also hold a reference of ClientLayerManager in TabChild::DidComposite(). And you might want to add a comment that the function might not exit quickly.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not too easily as someone needs to figure out how to make trigger the lifetime mistake.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? A little bit.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? Probably many of them.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? It should be easy to create backports.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? It shouldn't be too likely to cause regressions as it just keeping things alive a little longer, however it is possible to imagine regressions.

This is too late for the 45 release cycle.
This can go in after March 15, when we're in the new cycle.
It would be good to know how far back this goes. "Probably many of them" isn't very definitive. :-)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1330271#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-04-25 18:44:07 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Christian Holler, Tyson Smith, and Phil Ringalda reported memory safety problems and crashes that are fixed in Firefox ESR 45.1, Firefox ESR 38.8 and Firefox 46.

Marking s-s because this crashes with a weird memory address. Also marking as fuzzblocker because there is practically nothing a signature could reliably match on.

I'm going to assume this is crashing inside JIT code based on the lack of symbols. Jan, can you look at this or find somebody to look at it? Thanks.Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

[Bug 1131955](/show_bug.cgi?id=1131955 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add collectRangeInfoPreTrunc to boundscheck") added MBoundsCheck::fallible\_, if that's false we don't emit any LIR or code for it.
Here TryEliminateBoundsCheck is eliminating a fallible bounds check by updating an infallible one before it, but since it's infallible, we don't emit any code for it...
This is serious.Keywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---)

Patch
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Writing a test for this is not completely obvious or trivial, but it's also not extremely difficult...
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
39+.
> If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 1131955](/show_bug.cgi?id=1131955 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add collectRangeInfoPreTrunc to boundscheck").
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Should be easy to backport.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely; I don't expect any perf/correctness regressions.

OK, jonco just confirmed to me that not doing this is bad. Like "leave a dangling JSObject\* there" bad.
We should fix this and uplift to all affected branches.
The specific thing that needs fixing is that workerdebuggersandbox\_class has an objectMovedOp (workerdebuggersandbox\_moved) that does nothing. Presumably it has a non-null objectMovedOp because nsWrapperCache::SetWrapper asserts that the JSClass of the object being set has such a thing. And the reason it does \_that\_ is because per comments above nsWrapperCache::UpdateWrapper that objectMovedOp MUST update the wrapper cache's stored pointer if the object moves. Otherwise that pointer will be stale.Flags: needinfo?

This code has been around for some time, so I assume we have to uplift this patch to all branches.
Boris, I can request the uplift, but I don't fully understand the user impact if this patch is declined. Can you help clarify that?

The user impact is that if a worker debugger sandbox is created, then after that the wrapper cache pointer can go stale when a gc happens. After that point, we probably crash the next time we try to cycle collect on that worker (or anything else which tries to use that JS object). If we're lucky, it's not an exploitable crash; I have no idea how likely it is that we get lucky.

Including ESR-38? This is marked as blocking [bug 1092102](/show_bug.cgi?id=1092102 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement the remainder of the worker debugger API"); is that what introduced this code? That landed about a year ago--after 38--and I don't see workerdebuggingsandbox code in WorkerScope.cpp on the ESR-39 branch. ESR-45 definitely needs a patch though.
A remote attacker can't create a worker debugger sandbox, right? If the best attack involves luring the victim into debugging your malicious page we could probably lower the severity to sec-moderate. On the other hand a faux-innocent "why doesn't my page work?" request or bug report could be a successful targeted attack.Group: dom-core-security → core-security-release

In theory, the only way to create a worker debugger sandbox is by calling createSandbox on WorkerDebuggerGlobalScope. That global is only available to debugger scripts, which can only be loaded in a worker via a call to WorkerDebugger.initialize on the main thread. That method, in turn, is only available to chrome code.
I should add that debugger code in a worker can evaluate code in the main worker global (by evaluating code in the console, for instance), and code in the main worker global can trigger code in the debugger's global (by hitting a breakpoint, for instance). It might be possible for the debuggee to somehow trick the debugger into creating a sandbox.
To minimise the risk of attacks like that, we use an opaque security wrapper that allows the debugger to have references to debuggee objects (we need at least one such reference to tell the debugger API what global to debug), but does not allow the debugger to inspect those objects in any way. Conversely, the debuggee is not allowed to have any references ot debugger objects at all.
I hope that gives you the information you need.
My understanding is that we need to uplift to aurora, beta, and ESR45. Do you still need me to request approval for those, or can you take it from here?Flags: needinfo?(ejpbruel)

Patch to be reviewed
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
User impact if declined: Can cause Firefox to crash.
Fix Landed on Version: 48
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): No significant risk.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: N/A
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: 1092102
[User impact if declined]: Can cause Firefox to crash.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
[Risks and why]: Without this patch, the wrapper cache for a worker debugger sandbox can go stale when a gc happens. If that happens, the next time we try to do a cc, the browser could crash. It is unclear whether this crash is exploitable or not.

Patch to be reviewed
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Unclear.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No. The problem is one of omission. It is unlikely to be spotted unless someone had intimate knowledge of the wrapper cache.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
aurora, beta, and esr45 are affected
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[bug 1092102](/show_bug.cgi?id=1092102 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement the remainder of the worker debugger API") introduced the flaw
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I don't have any backports. The patch should apply as it is on all branches, with minimal to no rebasing required.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely.Flags: needinfo?(ejpbruel)

The crash in 44.0.x (featuring a lot of fffffffe5e5e5e5 crash addresses) is clearly a use-after-free. The crashes in 45.0.x are in a different spot (new code added in 45 by [bug 1219299](/show_bug.cgi?id=1219299 "RESOLVED FIXED - rework aria-owns implementation")). None of the 45.0.x crashes show the jemalloc-poisoned values, but the patch still looks like UAF-prevention. We should land this patch on the ESR-45 branch.Group: core-security-release

I think I likely exposed an existing problem. IonBuilder::jsop\_regexp(RegExpObject\* reobj) consults TI's OBJECT\_FLAG\_REGEXP\_FLAGS\_SET to determine whether cloning is required and notes this in MIR so codegen is accordingly affected. \*But\*, it does so without adding a constraint on that value never changing. If we later change it, as here, nothing promptly invalidates that previously-generated code. Most likely [bug 1215430](/show_bug.cgi?id=1215430 "RESOLVED FIXED - The RegExp creation code is a stateful, unintelligible mess")'s refactoring perturbed something just so, to make the assert happen -- but a differently-written testcase probably could fail for the same reason.
I'm currently somewhat trying to understand the problem in a debugger, but my understanding of spew isn't great, so I'm not sure how far I'll get on that tack. At worst I could just add the constraint, observe that fixes things, and be "good enough". But this is 1) intellectually unsatisfying and wouldn't aid my understanding of parts of SpiderMonkey internals I don't already grok, and 2) gives no insight into whether the failure merits a higher security rating. Certainly "sec-high" here can't represent deep understanding of how we go off the rails here, and how controllable that process might be, since nobody investigated this already.
For now, still trying to understand the matter. At worst I can call in reinforcements, but I hope it doesn't come to that.Flags: needinfo?(jwalden+bmo)

[Patch, \*without\* usable testcase](attachment.cgi?id=8724005&action=diff) (obsolete)

[Comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1242810#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Assertion failure: MIR instruction returned object with unexpected type, at js/src/jit/MacroAssembler.cpp:1445") is a sack of lies written by a lying liar who lied and is a bad person who should feel bad.
The real problem is that IonBuilder::jsop\_regexp adds a constraint on OBJECT\_FLAG\_REGEXP\_FLAGS\_SET. We expect, for reasons not 100% clear to me, that the object created for a regexp literal will always have the same ObjectGroup. Examine <https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/bc949d6e3aaa> carefully, and you'll see CloneRegExpObject \*used\* to create a regexp with the provided RegExp's group in all circumstances, but that patch in the modified-statics case made us instead do RegExpAlloc(cx) which did \*not\* share a group. The JIT in paranoia-mode added extra logic checking that the type of the created regexp was as expected, but because we got a new regexp without sharing a group, things became Inconsistent, and so we asserted. This fixes the problem by reverting back to always using the same group.
I would like to have a clearer test for this than [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1242810#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Assertion failure: MIR instruction returned object with unexpected type, at js/src/jit/MacroAssembler.cpp:1445"). My attempt is in this patch, but it doesn't work. I'd \*like\* to have a test that fails even if the asserts aren't compiled in, but this doesn't cut it. The apparent consequence of this bug, is that we'd create a RegExp with a different TypeSet from expected. How to expose that difference? Not sure. Note that we're fighting against logic to avoid cloning RegExps at all, and if we look too funny at the /foo/ we'll perturb logic and possibly suppress an otherwise-bug.
Anyway. Halp, I would like to have a better/clearer test for this than fuzzer garbage. :-)

If we parse on the main thread, the regex literal will get the 'canonical' group for the regex Class + proto. In that case there's no problem, because CloneRegExpObject will use that same group.
The problem shows up when we parse off-thread: the off-thread parse compartment will create a \*different\* group for the regex literal. Then we merge the parse-compartment's groups with the main compartment and we end up with a regex literal that has a group != the canonical group for that Class + proto.
The JIT's 'paranoia-mode' type checks are there for a reason: these TI bugs are sec-crits. The test below crashes an opt build (it's a near-null crash, but it should be possible to modify it to do worse).
Hope that helps.

Given the trickiness in understanding TI well enough to exploit this, I'm not super-worried about this being found in the field. So I think it's probably best not to try landing this super-late in a cycle, even if the patch seems pretty clear and unlikely to cause any regressions. A few weeks into the next cycle seems like a good time to land this, to me. Here's the final patch for use when the time comes.

Patch for landing (does not include test)
Note that this change and [bug 1253099](/show_bug.cgi?id=1253099 "VERIFIED FIXED - Assertion failure: p, at js/src/vm/Shape.cpp:1568 with RegExp and GC") touch the same area of code, so these two changes must mildly coordinate landing. Both are sec bugs we should fix, of similar-ish danger IMO, so coordination should be easy enough.
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
If you understand TI well...maybe easily? I dunno. The set of people capable of exploiting this is probably fairly low, but why take unnecessary risks.
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included
> in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No. And tests are separated out to land a bit after the fact.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
> If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
44 onward, judging by the TM of [bug 1215430](/show_bug.cgi?id=1215430 "RESOLVED FIXED - The RegExp creation code is a stateful, unintelligible mess") that introduced this. Spot-checking 45 says it's there for sure.
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how
> different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Should be easy to make.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much
> testing does it need?
Fairly low-risk. I'd wait 2-3 weeks into the cycle to land in m-c, then percolate through branches over the subsequent few days.Flags: needinfo?(jwalden+bmo)

The issue here is very subtle. When we're setting the dir to "auto" on the span, we get to this code: <<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/DirectionalityUtils.cpp#509>> under this stack:

Here, rootNode is the <bdi> element which doesn't have a dir attribute yet. But HasDirAuto() returns true for it, since it's a <bdi> element! <<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/Element.h#353>> Therefore, we start going into the weeds, like this. We call WalkDescendantsSetDirectionFromText(), and it first finds the "f" text node, but it won't use it because that's aChangedNode, so it keeps looking, and then it finds the "g" text node and incorrectly determines that "g" determines the directionality of our <bdi> node. Later when we set the dir="auto" attribute on the <bdi> element itself, we correctly decide that "f" determines the directionality of the <bdi> and later when we remove the span, we correctly clear the directionality map entry for "f" but not "g" (since that is in an inconsistent state) and we lose. IOW, this bug can only be triggered by this \*exact\* test case. ;-)
The fix is very simple. We need to run the downward propagation algorithm only if we've encountered a real dir=auto element, not a <bdi> without one.Assignee: nobody → ehsanFlags: needinfo?(smontagu)

Only run the downward propagation algorithm for elements with a real dir=auto attribute
I'm not really familiar with this stuff.
Like, I have no idea when "downward propagation algorithm" should run and when not. Based on [Bug 613149](/show_bug.cgi?id=613149 "RESOLVED FIXED - Support HTML5 bdi element and CSS property unicode-bidi: isolate"), peterv might be better reviewer for this code.
Feels \_very \_error prone to have a method called HasDirAuto() which doesn't mean what we want here.
The code has
1491 // Set if the node has dir=auto.
1492 NodeHasDirAuto
That clearly hints that attribute value is auto.
But based on the code <bdi> sets the flag too. So the comment is wrong at least, but I'd
say also the flag name and its setter/getter.
Did you go through other HasDirAuto() usage?
So, I would change HasDirAuto() implementation to
bool HasDirAuto() { return HasFixedDir() && HasValidDir(); }
and then rename NodeHasDirAuto to something else. NodeBehavesAsDirAuto or some such.
But ok, that becomes rather large change, not anything for branches.

Ehsan is this something we should be trying to get onto 44? Is it affected? Are you still working on the patch? Or is the problem in the patch? Thanks.
We should track this for 44+ since it's sec-critical, but it looks like it may end up wontfix for 44.

After further investigation, I think most of [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1228882#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: element already removed from map\" or heap-buffer-overflow with <bdi>, dir=auto") is correct, but the conclusion I originally drew from it is not.
The real problem here is that WalkDescendantsSetDirectionFromText() thinks that the "f" text node is being changed, which is the beginning of things getting into an inconsistent state. We use this function from three places: the call site in question, TextNodeChangedDirection() and ResetDirectionSetByTextNode(). In the latter two cases, the contents of the text node are changing in a way that make it impossible for it to affect the direction of dir=auto ancestors. However, in the call site in question, all we're doing is re-resolving the auto direction of any possible ancestors, but we know that the text node hasn't necessarily changed in a way to make it no longer responsible for any dir=auto ancestors. Therefore, in this call site we should be passing null for aChangedNode. Once that happens, following [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1228882#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: element already removed from map\" or heap-buffer-overflow with <bdi>, dir=auto"), the "f" text node will be picked, which is the correct text node to choose here.

I had a question about oldTextNode at <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/DirectionalityUtils.cpp#506>, which is then passed to WalkDescendantsSetDirectionFromText as aChangedNode. We cast it to Element\*, but from your comments here it sounds like it's really a text node. WalkDescendantsSetDirectionFromText has this check: |child->NodeType() == nsIDOMNode::TEXT\_NODE && child != aChangedNode|, which if aChangedNode is an element is an odd condition. Do you know what's really going on there?Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

This argument is only useful when it points to a text node (hence the check in WalkDescendantsSetDirectionFromText). The cast to Element there is wrong, and we're getting lucky since the pointer math turns out to the correct case. Also calling this "text node" along the way is not really helpful. I submitted a patch to improve things in [bug 1257208](/show_bug.cgi?id=1257208 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix some confusing naming and casts in DirectionalityUtils.cpp") to keep the cleanup separate from this bug.Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

Don't assume that the textnode has changed when checking whether any textnode descendants determine the directionality of a dir=auto ancestor
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not very easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? No. The commit message basically describes the code change in English.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? No, and very easy (if the patch doesn't apply verbatim.)
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? It passed our existing tests. Still I think some baking time would be needed since the code in question is pretty complex.

Don't assume that the textnode has changed when checking whether any textnode descendants determine the directionality of a dir=auto ancestor
sec-approval+. We'll want Aurora and Beta patches made and nominated. I suspect we'll want this on ESR38 and ESR45 also.

Landing now in beta (for beta 5) means we have some time to fix possible regressions in beta. So I am inclined to uplift now.

Ehsan,
Next week's ESR38 (ESR38.8) is the last release. Technically, given its rating, we'd normally fix this in ESR38 given our normal criteria.Whiteboard: [adv-main46+][adv-esr45.1+]

This has the same signature as [Bug 1203763](/show_bug.cgi?id=1203763 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - ASan: heap-use-after-free [@mozilla::GMPVideoDecoder::GMPInitDone]"). This is not OpenH264; it's playback (EME). Chris -- This is marked as a regression, blocking Fx46 release and a top crasher. Can you take it and drive this to a fix? Or find someone on your team to drive this to a fix?

#3 topcrash in beta 46 so far. I agree, being the very top crashes and sec-critical should probably make this a release blocker.

There are two problems here, caused by races in shutdown.
The first problem here is that GMP{Audio,Video}Decoder::mInitPromise is set to null in GMP{Audio,Video}Decoder::Shutdown() after it's rejected. So if the GMP decoder is shutdown after Init() is called, but before GMPInitDone() is called, mInitPromise can be null, and that's how we get the null pointer deref on mInitPromise.
The other case we see is the UAF in GMP{Audio,Video}Decoder::mConfig in GMPInitDone. This is because mConfig is a const reference to a struct probably held by the MediaFormatReader or demuxer, which must have been freed. We can just make a copy of the config.

Note: I mean shutdown of the decoder, not shutdown of Firefox.

Attached patch

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8730519&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1256065&attachment=8730519)

\* Check whether GMP{Audio,Video}Decoder::mInitPromise is empty and bail if so in GMPInitDone. This prevents null pointer deref.
\* Make a copy of the MediaInfo passed to GMP{Audio,Video}Decoder, rather than keeping a reference to it. This means we can't get a UAF if the thing that owns the MediaInfo is destroyed before the GMP decoder is. That can happen because the callback object maintains a reference to the GMP decoder while we wait for a GMPInitDone callback.

Patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
I think it could be hardish. Attacker would need to construct an MP4 file with valid audio/video stream metadata that populates the MediaInfo/AudioInfo/VideoInfo structs to create valid executable code, and then if unencrypted decoding using GeckoMediaPlugins is enabled, play the video inside a regular non-EME <video> element and spam shutting down and starting up.
Unencrypted decoding is enabled in Firefox 46 and later.
In theory an attacker could load this video inside an EME <video> as well, though we have no crash reports that I can find proving this is possible. We only have crash reports for the unencrypted video case AFAICT. EME is enabled in Firefox 42 and later.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I think a skilled attacker could work backwards from the class/struct names to figure out what the flaw was. Figuring out that they could exploit this using unencrypted decoding and/or ClearKey EME would be a bit of a leap.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
46 is affected in the unencrypted video decoding case. 45 and ESR45 in theory are affected in the EME video case, though we've not seen any crash reports in the EME case.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not yet. We need Release 45. ESR45, and Aurora, Beta, Central. Should be easy enough.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely to cause regressions. Basically adding null-check type guards. I'm not 100% sure I fixed all the cases, since I can't repro, so testing this not-too-late in the beta cycle would be good.
We can also land this in inconspicuously in [bug 1256064](/show_bug.cgi?id=1256064 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash in mozilla::MozPromise<T>::Private::Resolve<T> (called from MediaTimer::UpdateLocked)") to make it less visible that it's an exploitable bug.

# USN-2936-3: Firefox regression

19 May 2016

USN-2936-1 introduced a regression in Firefox.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-2936-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update caused an issue

where a device update POST request was sent every time about:preferences#sync

was shown. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Christian Holler, Tyson Smith, Phil Ringalda, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman,

Mats Palmgren, Carsten Book, Boris Zbarsky, David Bolter, Randell Jesup,

Andrew McCreight, and Steve Fink discovered multiple memory safety issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2804](/security/CVE-2016-2804), [CVE-2016-2806](/security/CVE-2016-2806),

[CVE-2016-2807](/security/CVE-2016-2807))

An invalid write was discovered when using the JavaScript .watch() method in

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2808](/security/CVE-2016-2808))

Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free and buffer overflow in service

workers. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2811](/security/CVE-2016-2811), [CVE-2016-2812](/security/CVE-2016-2812))

Sascha Just discovered a buffer overflow in libstagefright in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2814](/security/CVE-2016-2814))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that CSP is not applied correctly to web

content sent with the multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks when they would otherwise be prevented. ([CVE-2016-2816](/security/CVE-2016-2816))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that the chrome.tabs.update API for web

extensions allows for navigation to javascript: URLs. A malicious

extension could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-2817](/security/CVE-2016-2817))

Mark Goodwin discovered that about:healthreport accepts certain events

from any content present in the remote-report iframe. If another

vulnerability allowed the injection of web content in the remote-report

iframe, an attacker could potentially exploit this to change the user's

sharing preferences. ([CVE-2016-2820](/security/CVE-2016-2820))

This is pretty bad:
\* JSErrorReport has a `char\* linebuf` that stores both a part of the line + tokenptr.
\* In this case, the line has a null-byte.
\* Then CopyErrorReport does strlen(report->linebuf), so the copy only has the first part of the buffer.
JSErrorReport is a mess unfortunately :(

Hm I think the only place where we depend on report->(uc)linebuf holding at least tokenptr - linebuf chars is PrintError (where we're crashing here).
There are some places in Gecko where we also do tokenptr - linebuf, but that's just to determine the column number (which seems bogus because linebuf only holds a small part of the string).

This patch just adds a linebufLength to JSErrorReport and fixes CopyErrorReport to use that instead of strlen.
JSErrorReport really needs a round of refactoring though. Or ten rounds.Assignee: nobody → jdemooijStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
r=me on what's here, but I think you need a bit more changing in this. And because it's probably not a great idea individually evaluating each change for safety deferring to another bug or not, we probably should do it all here, even if it makes for a bigger-than-definitely-necessary patch.
Change dom/workers/WorkerPrivate.cpp's use of uclinebuf to copy the whole string based on linebufLength. Also file a bug to make that file's |columnNumber = aReport->uctokenptr - aReport->uclinebuf;| use aReport->column as well (I think you can, but neither you nor I should eyeball it and do that here -- plus it should change behavior, and so requires tests and bz-level scrutiny).
Also |uint32\_t column = err->uctokenptr - err->uclinebuf;| in js/xpconnect/src/XPCComponents.cpp, new bug for that. And the gratuitous casts three lines down could die, too. And |uclinebuf ? nsDependentString(uclinebuf) : EmptyString()| just beneath there should be converted to pass in the full uclinebuf length, not the null-terminated bit.
And in js/xpconnect/src/XPCConvert.cpp, a gratuitous cast. And an nsDependentString truncation. And in the InitWithWindowID, should pass column and not a subtraction. More new bug fodder.
netwerk/base/ProxyAutoConfig.cpp should also pass a dependent string with full context, not a truncated form.
Actually, this is enough you probably really should just fix it all here, rather than sort through exactly which changes can be deferred -- safely -- and which cannot. And you probably should have a Gecko person review the adjustments and associated tests, too, in addition to just me.

Actually it doesn't truncate: LossyTwoByteCharsToNewLatin1CharsZ uses tbchars.length(). So it should be safe, but agreed this is really confusing.

I think the test then no longer triggers the ASAN failure, but I can repro locally so I can try that (decoder also said the number of o's in foooo matters).

No, it's also used below, for the message string IIRC :( So yeah, we should probably fix all that too while we're at it.

Oh, right. Did I see this, then forget it, during reviewing? :-( Feh.

I don't think I am. :-( There's enough variety of change, and truncation in various places, that I really don't feel comfortable picking and choosing my way through which are safe to defer to another bug, and which must be done now. I'd rather see a slightly-larger patch that fixes the problems everywhere, than one that knowingly misses spots -- but still has to fully review every spot to be sure it's safe to defer there, anyway. Even if this 5K patch sized up to 10-15K, I still wouldn't be too worried about its size.Flags: needinfo?(jwalden+bmo)

This patch is much nicer than the previous one.
I made these JSErrorReport fields private and added a method to initialize them all at once. This makes it much easier to check the invariants.
It also removes tokenptr/uctokenptr; it's simpler to just store a tokenOffset.
Flagging bz for the changes outside js/src.

Good point, most of these places should probably use the |column| field instead. (Waldo also mentioned that.) I think it matters for long lines, in that case |linebuf| does not contain the whole line. I'll file a followup bug for this.

Yes it's guaranteed to be null-terminated (the patch asserts this in JSErrorReport::initLinebuf). I'll add a comment.

Yes. (Sorry for the delay.)
Given that we don't have much time, it should be fine to get this in 46 but not 45: this code is ancient and I don't think there's an actual (non-shell) security bug here.
So let's treat it as a security bug, just in case, but since the patch is not trivial, I'd rather not land it (on beta) last minute.Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

(In reply to Jeff Walden [:Waldo] (remove +bmo to email) from [comment #18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1212328#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ js::PrintError] with heap-buffer-overflow involving evalInWorker"))

I was working on this and then realized the latin1 copy of linebuf in JSErrorReport is \*only\* used in js::PrintError, but there we can just as easily use uclinebuf.
That lets us remove the confusing LossyTwoByteCharsToNewLatin1CharsZ and I think that's worth doing as part of this bug. Will post an updated patch.

Waldo, sorry for the churn, but removing the latin1 linebuf made this much nicer and simpler.

Patch
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It's not clear this is even exploitable - the crash here is in a shell-only function. The patch also cleans up some gnarly code elsewhere, though.
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All, it's ancient code AFAIK.
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Shouldn't be too hard.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Pretty low risk.

Jan, Al: I noticed that the patch is nom'd for uplift to esr38. Given that this is not easily exploitable and the fix is pretty big (not a one-liner), I plan to deny the esr38 uplift and wontfix for that version.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1330270#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-04-25 18:41:29 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Mats Palmgren, Carsten Book, Boris Zbarsky, David Bolter, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety problems and crashes that are fixed in Firefox ESR 45.1 and Firefox 46.  External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2016/mfsa2016-39.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1330270#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-04-25 18:41:37 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Mozilla project Upstream: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Mats Palmgren, Carsten Book, Boris Zbarsky, David Bolter, Randell Jesup   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1330270#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-04-26 19:45:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2016:0695 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0695.html>   ``` |  |

That patch just looks like it just adds an assertion, so the actual underlying regression would be earlier.

For some reason we create the global and all associated state that we're going to use when parsing off-main-thread using a normal context. This allows these allocations to be made in the nursery, then moved off-main-thread. This is, obviously, highly catastrophic.
In general, the global allocation paths are very careful to avoid allocating in the nursery, for exactly this reason. Unfortunately, the metadata system is allocated in a generic fashion, automatically, below this layer. This /really/ should have all be converted over to ExclusiveContext when OMT parsing landed. I'm sure we can hack around it somehow in the short term, but we really do need to make all this use ExclusiveContext at some point soon.Flags: needinfo?(terrence)

Steve suggested a second assertion we can add to guard even harder: when tenuring, check that the target Zone is not an OMT zone.

As we discussed today, this is a hack to work around the crash. It should be easy to backport to branches as well, as we'll need something much more involved to solve the problem at a more core level.Assignee: nobody → terrenceStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

fuzz-1251922-v0.diff
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
I think it would be quite difficult. You'd have to trick the user into enabling the debugger to turn on metadata collection, then take advantage of a race with the GC to corrupt the free lists. That would, I think, allow you to finalize a live object, which could lead to UAF. It would be a same-zone write however, so I'm not sure how useful it would actually be.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes, although I think it's unlikely that anyone is looking at GC flaws yet, considering how hard they are to exploit.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All currently shipping branches.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
--
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I'm not sure when metadata suppression was added, but I think it was early enough that we should be able to backport easily.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely. When we merge back into the main thread, it looks like we unset the debuggee status, which means we can't make use of the metadata object. Thus, we won't be losing any functionality by not creating it in the first place.

Hi Terrence. Based on [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1251922#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Assertion failure: isNurseryAllocAllowed(), at js/src/gc/Allocator.cpp:153"), it appears that there could be more work here. Once this bug is fixed, can you make another bug to track that?

# USN-2936-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

27 April 2016

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Christian Holler, Tyson Smith, Phil Ringalda, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman,

Mats Palmgren, Carsten Book, Boris Zbarsky, David Bolter, Randell Jesup,

Andrew McCreight, and Steve Fink discovered multiple memory safety issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2804](/security/CVE-2016-2804), [CVE-2016-2806](/security/CVE-2016-2806),

[CVE-2016-2807](/security/CVE-2016-2807))

An invalid write was discovered when using the JavaScript .watch() method in

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2808](/security/CVE-2016-2808))

Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free and buffer overflow in service

workers. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2811](/security/CVE-2016-2811), [CVE-2016-2812](/security/CVE-2016-2812))

Sascha Just discovered a buffer overflow in libstagefright in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2016-2814](/security/CVE-2016-2814))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that CSP is not applied correctly to web

content sent with the multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks when they would otherwise be prevented. ([CVE-2016-2816](/security/CVE-2016-2816))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that the chrome.tabs.update API for web

extensions allows for navigation to javascript: URLs. A malicious

extension could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-2817](/security/CVE-2016-2817))

Mark Goodwin discovered that about:healthreport accepts certain events

from any content present in the remote-report iframe. If another

vulnerability allowed the injection of web content in the remote-report

iframe, an attacker could potentially exploit this to change the user's

sharing preferences. ([CVE-2016-2820](/security/CVE-2016-2820))

This test looks fishy to me. GC is being called while the RegExp object stringifies something, might be that something is collected there while it shouldn't be. Marking s-s.

Hmm. I can reproduce this, but only with the particular specified compile options (and possibly only on the reported revision, for me). Tricksy. Investigating.

It's [bug 1215430](/show_bug.cgi?id=1215430 "RESOLVED FIXED - The RegExp creation code is a stateful, unintelligible mess"), but the problem is kind of not so much with the changes made there as with the existing code. Sort of. (But don't quote me on that just yet, as I need to do more investigation to understand the consequences of this mistake for sec-\* purposes.)
The problem basically appears to be that RegExp objects, which are created with a set of builtin properties from birth (now just the single lastIndex property, formerly also .multiline, .sticky, .global, and so on), are created in two steps: RegExpAlloc and RegExpInitialize. The former creates the object \*but\* doesn't quite fully do the builtin-property initialization. The latter does that initialization. \*If\* the first RegExp in a compartment is created by the former method, then another RegExp is created and initialized by the two methods \*before\* the first RegExp can be initialized using RegExpInitialize, you hit issues.
I think the fix is going to be to add the shape-initialization to add the builtin properties to RegExpAlloc -- which also happens to be consistent with ES6's RegExpAlloc algorithm. Patch tomorrow.Flags: needinfo?(jwalden+bmo)

Attached patch

[Patch (no tests yet)](attachment.cgi?id=8726655&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8726655&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1253099&attachment=8726655)

Okay, this sort of spiraled. A little.
Moving shape-assignment into RegExpAlloc isn't too bad, but at that point initFromAtom becomes nigh-infallible. So then I decided to make it infallbile, but then I realized: it really \*shouldn't\* be infallible. Its use in RegExpInitialize (a spec algorithm) is wrong, because RegExpInitialize can be called on RegExps that have been exposed to script. And that could let someone overwrite a "non-writable" lastIndex property with a zero, when such writing should actually fail.
Given this overwriting is a Caja violation (and sec-highish for that reason), and I was halfway there with the patch already, and my halfway-work didn't really tee up .lastIndex setting for a proper fix, I decided it made sense to do everything in one patch. We have to fix all this stuff everywhere, so it doesn't seem to make much difference that it's being done in a sec bug instead of a more public one.
Here's the patch, with some refactoring of algorithms, a bunch of function-renaming to make the spec-algorithm similarities/differences clear, and more assertions.
Tests, including for the .lastIndex setting/zeroing bug, coming later today, after sleep. But for now it seems good to get this in front of people.

the value of LAST\_INDEX\_SLOT can be obtained by public static lastIndexSlot() method.
maybe we could use it there and remove friend declaration here?

Good call. Fixed locally.
[Bug 1242810](/show_bug.cgi?id=1242810 "VERIFIED FIXED - Assertion failure: MIR instruction returned object with unexpected type, at js/src/jit/MacroAssembler.cpp:1445") and this bug touch the same areas of code, so they'll have to have somewhat-coordinated landing, once both have sec-approval. So no posting an updated version of the patch, because I've based it atop the patch for that bug.

I made the requested comment-change, but some of these comments have me a little leery, so I removed them to their own patch. I'll post those comments in a separate patch, to land after the main one. (Say, a week or so after releases with the bug fixed have happened, maybe.)

Final patch, no tests, no too-incriminating comments
[Security approval request comment]
\* How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
For the Caja-esque parts of this, wrt letting RegExp.prototype.compile modify a non-writable property -- pretty easy to invoke that.
For the assertion failure originally triggering the bug-filing: I'm not at all certain whether subsequent execution might be exploitable; I don't know exactly how our HashTable code works in the case in play there. But it's definitely trivial to trigger that failing case.
\* Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Tests will land at their usual delay after this patch lands. The possibly-incriminating comments, I've moved to a separate patch, that I'm going to land a week or so after releases with these problems fixed. (efaust and) I think there's cause for concern about correctly using these APIs, so it's desirable not to let things go uncommented for too long -- but no need to make it easier to understand the problem solved, right off the bat.
\* Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
44 onward, so ESR45 and aurora/beta.
\* Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Shouldn't be too hard, or riskier than this is. I can always re-review if trunk's diverged from the original regressed state more than I think it has.
\* How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Relatively unlikely, but there's enough moving parts here that probably landing a few weeks out, rather than closer to release, would probably be best.

sec-approval+ to land this on trunk. I think we'll want to backport this to Aurora, Beta, and ESR45. I'll let release management approve that.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: [bug 1215430](/show_bug.cgi?id=1215430 "RESOLVED FIXED - The RegExp creation code is a stateful, unintelligible mess")
[User impact if declined]: sec-high for the ability to mutate a non-writable .lastIndex, wrt Caja; unclear what the severity is for the original assertion -- don't know exactly what the contents of the misbegotten HashTable ptr (\*not\* pointer, it's a HashTable structure) are, when no match is found, or the consequences of writing into that bad ptr
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: trunk patch tested on tryserver, landed on m-i earlier today
[Risks and why]: this refactors/touches a moderate-ish bit of code in pursuit of fixing two issues, so a little riskier -- a little extra experience landing this now, rather than 1-2 weeks later, will be valuable
[String/UUID change made/needed]: N/A

[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: sec-high for the Caja overwrite-immutable-property aspect, unclear for the rest
User impact if declined: sec-high, maybe worse
Fix Landed on Version: trunk is 48, right?
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): slightly risky as it touches a bit of code, but I think that's addressable by landing this earlier in a cycle
String or UUID changes made by this patch: N/A

This bug was filed from the Socorro interface and is
report [bp-7db23744-0e54-43f8-b1bf-0b2b52160315](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/7db23744-0e54-43f8-b1bf-0b2b52160315).
=============================================================
Crash is on a line last touched by froyd in [bug 1189829](/show_bug.cgi?id=1189829 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix O(n^2) behavior in nsConsoleService::ClearMessagesForWindowID"); the bug might pre-exist that change however.
UAF signature, with ~1000 crashes in the last week. Likely a sec-crit; certainly a sec-high

So we assert that we're on the main thread [1] which is good enough if anything else accessing the message array is main thread only as well, but that's not the case [2].
I think we need to lock |mLock| to actually guarantee thread safety.

Also just to be clear, this was a latent issue existing prior to [bug 1189829](/show_bug.cgi?id=1189829 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix O(n^2) behavior in nsConsoleService::ClearMessagesForWindowID"). It was most likely introduced in [bug 814497](/show_bug.cgi?id=814497 "RESOLVED FIXED - Ensure passing the stack object out of platform codebase").

Nice. Does nsConsoleService::ClearMessages() need this treatment, too? It also accesses mMessages without a lock. I guess it is only called from Reset() where the lock is held and from the dtor which hopefully can't happen when anything else holds it.

Yeah I checked that as well and came to the same conclusions.

Lock while iterating console messages
Carrying forward r+.
> [Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Hard for me to assess, I would guess given the prevalence of crashes it would be pretty easy.
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Nothing explicit, but it's pretty clear what we're fixing.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This goes back to 42, so all.
> If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
It affects all, was introduced in [bug 814497](/show_bug.cgi?id=814497 "RESOLVED FIXED - Ensure passing the stack object out of platform codebase").
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Patch should apply cleanly to all supported branches.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely to regress, fixes crashes.

Ok, I am able to reproduce this issue (unfortunately not under rr yet), the issue is a near null dereference caused by the lack of MResumePoint while lowering the MRegExp instruction.
When assignSafepoint is used, both the mir()->resumePoint() and the lastResumePoint\_ are null. This suggest that the block did not had any MResumePoint. Only a few code path can produce such basic blocks, either the Split-Edge phase ([Bug 1186006](/show_bug.cgi?id=1186006 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash at js::jit::LRecoverInfo::appendResumePoint js::jit::LRecoverInfo::init js::jit::LRecoverInfo::New js::jit::LIRGeneratorShared::getRecoverInfo js::jit::LIRGeneratorShared::buildSnapshot")) or the Value Numbering ([Bug 1221872](/show_bug.cgi?id=1221872 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash in js::jit::LRecoverInfo::appendResumePoint")).
Normally, we have a work-around in the Lowering to propagate the lastResumePoint\_ from the previous block, but this does not work if the block has multiple predecessors.
I will try to extract this function and build a shell test case.

I can reproduce this issue with this test case on x64 and with a debug build while running with --no-threads.
Note, using --ion-eager, or even --baseline-eager cause the test to spin indefinitely.
The problem seems to be related to the Value Numbering phase. ([Bug 1221872](/show_bug.cgi?id=1221872 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash in js::jit::LRecoverInfo::appendResumePoint"))

Ok, the problem seems to comes from the fact that Value Numbering is removing blocks as it goes and not as a later phase.
In the following test minimal case (x64 debug build, running --no-threads):
function find(c, unbox, t) {
if (typeof t != "string") return; // (1)
while (true) { // (2)
while (t == "" && !inJit());
c--;
if (c == 0) {
while (unbox) { // (3)
if (inIon()) return;
}
}
}
};
find(1, {}, '');
What happens for reasons which I yet have to investigate, the condition (1) if infered as always being false. This leaves the MIRGraph in 2 separated graphs, because of the OSR entry point into (3). As we have an OSR block, and that it can loop back into the beginning of the while loop (2), we inster a ficup OSR block before the loop (2). This fixup block is here to keep the domination order clean, and prevents big graphs re-ordering around the OSR block.
Later during Value Numbering, we infer that the condition of (3) will always be true-ish (= object), and thus the exit path of the while loop (1) no longer exists.
The problem here is that the fixup block which was made to keep the messed-up immediate dominator tree caused by the 2 entry points, no longer work as expected and dominates the outer loop (2) which can conditionally go into the inner loop (3) which can only return.
Thus, LICM is able to move invariant code (t == "") in the fixup-block, which does not have any resume point.Flags: needinfo?(sunfish)

Ok, I have been thinking for a while about this issue and making up test cases.
I think one solution to this problem would be to record all the fixup block that are added to the graph during the Value Numbering phase, and at the end of the Value Numbering iteration, we should:
1) Recompute the dominator tree(s).
2) Remove any block which is only dominated by fixup blocks.
Also note that it is possible to have more than one fixup block in the MIRGaph.
I will make a bunch of test cases, now that I am getting familiar with the trickiness of hitting this code path.

It is probably being inferred as being false, as we never recorded any call to "typeof" as we only entered the function while executing the interpreter.
I managed to reproduce the same behaviour by using the UCEfault-like pattern, and by calling the replaced function over-and-over to force the inlining of the replaced function.
var f = function () {
f = function () { return true; };
return false;
};
function find(c, unbox, t) {
if (f()) return;
while (true) {
while (t == "" && !inJit());
c--;
if (c == 0) {
while (unbox) {
if (f() && inIon()) return;
}
}
}
};
find(1, {}, '');

(not working yet)
I am on a dead end at trying to reverse engineer the current code, in order
to reuse it. I really do not want to add extra branches in the current
code, as I am not sure to grasp all corner cases.
I undertsand that the initial goal was to do only one traversal of the MIR
Graph, but now I think it would be easier understand and potentially more
efficient if we were to only flag Unreachable basic block as such, instead of
removing them from the graph, at the expense of additional reruns.
Now I am more thinking about re-using the code made for PruneUnusedBranches
second phase, to implement the removal of basic blocks.
Sunfish, as you might know this code better, would you take over this patch?

Here's a new patch which implements the same idea slightly differently.
In short, after GVN completely done, if any OSR fixup blocks have been created, do a full mark and sweep of the CFG and delete any completely unreachable blocks, other than OSR fixup blocks for reachable loops.
This fixes the reduced testcase, and is a conceptually simpler patch. What do you think?Flags: needinfo?(sunfish)

RemoveUnamrkedBlocks does not flag the operands of all instructions as having removed uses, which we should do, as otherwise we could make a truncation assuming that we know everything about Math instructions, and not keep a copy of the instruction for the bailout path.
Note this issue would be a correctness issue, but not a safety issue.

This function was made assuming that the graph has no removed blocks yet, and is faster if applied in with a PostorderIterator. I will recommend to make a separate loop only for calling this function, as done the the Prune Branch optimization.
Also note, that if we backport this patch, we might have to include this function as well, as it got added in Gecko a few versions ago.

How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily. It's difficult to create testcases that trigger the OSR fixup block condition in the first place; triggering this bug requires triggering it in a very specific way.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?

Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I don't, but they'd be fairly easy and straightforward to create.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely. Normal treeherder testing is probably sufficient.

Attached patch

[relax-assert.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8716575&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1238592&attachment=8716575)

The fix was backed out for causing jsapi test testJitGVN\_FixupOSROnlyLoopNested to fail, because there's an over-aggressive assert. This patch fixes it.
