Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple parts of the phpMyAdmin application, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application fails to properly escape or encode data in the following contexts:

1.  **Normalization Page:** The `normalization.php` file and the associated `js/normalization.js` file do not properly handle user-controlled table/column names.
2. **Database Structure Page:**  The `templates/database/structure/sortable_header.phtml` template does not properly sanitize parameters used for sorting.
3. **Central Columns Page:** The `pos` parameter in the `db_central_columns.php` file is not properly validated and sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding, resulting in multiple XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically, the following vulnerabilities are present:

*   **Stored XSS:**  In the database normalization page, crafted table/column names can be stored, and when viewed by other users, this will lead to the execution of injected scripts.
*   **Reflected XSS:** In the database structure and central columns pages, the vulnerabilities are reflected, meaning that malicious scripts are injected directly through URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the user's browser. This can have the following impacts:

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal user session cookies and hijack active sessions, gaining unauthorized access to the phpMyAdmin application.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious JavaScript could be used to extract sensitive data from the user's browser, such as database credentials or other information displayed in the phpMyAdmin interface.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker can alter the content of the phpMyAdmin interface, defacing the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** XSS can be leveraged to redirect users to malicious websites, facilitating malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network. An attacker can send crafted requests containing malicious payloads through the browser.
*   **HTTP Headers:** (specifically in CVE-2016-2560, but related to the general weakness) A crafted Host HTTP header can be used to inject malicious script, affecting other users.
*   **URL Parameters:** Attackers can craft malicious links with specific URL parameters that trigger the XSS vulnerabilities (`normalizeTo`, `pos`, sort parameters, etc.)
*   **Database Inputs:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts by creating tables with crafted names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of phpMyAdmin to exploit the vulnerabilities in the normalization, database structure, and central columns page, according to the phpmyadmin advisory. However, the SUSE advisory notes that for CVE-2016-2560, no authentication is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the phpMyAdmin server to send malicious requests.
*   **User Interaction:** For reflected XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker typically needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or accessing a crafted page. The user interaction requirement is noted in the CVSS v3 score.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The SUSE advisory indicates that this vulnerability has a "moderate" severity.
*   The phpMyAdmin security advisory (PMASA-2016-12) categorizes the severity as "non-critical" given the need for user authentication.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in phpMyAdmin versions 4.4.15.5 and 4.5.5.1, as well as later versions.

In summary, CVE-2016-2561 highlights multiple XSS flaws stemming from inadequate input sanitization and output encoding, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious actions.
