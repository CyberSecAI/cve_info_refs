February 2016 Security Release Summary

Two weeks ago we [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nodejs-sec/G8IA0G4uA88/So3Cw84YDwAJ) the planned release of updates to all active release lines, v0.10, v0.12, v4 and v5, to fix HTTP related vulnerabilities and to upgrade the bundled versions of OpenSSL.

Upon release of the OpenSSL updates we posted an [impact assessment](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nodejs-sec/G8IA0G4uA88/-UB4DpG1DwAJ) for Node.js users. We noted that the updates contained only one minor change that impacted Node.js users.

Today we have released Node.js [v0.10.42 (Maintenance)](/en/blog/release/v0.10.42/), [v0.12.10 (LTS)](/en/blog/release/v0.12.10/), [v4.3.0 "Argon" (LTS)](/en/blog/release/v4.3.0/) and [v5.6.0 (Stable)](/en/blog/release/v5.6.0/) with fixes for the announced vulnerabilities and updates to OpenSSL.
(/(/(/(/
**Please note that our LTS "Argon" release line has moved from v4.2.x to v4.3.x due to the security fixes enclosed. There will be no further updates to v4.2.x.** Users are advised to upgrade to v4.3.0 as soon as possible.

For the purpose of understanding the impact that the fixed vulnerabilities have on your Node.js deployment and the urgency of the upgrades for your circumstances we are providing details below.

### [CVE-2016-2086 Request Smuggling Vulnerability](#cve-2016-2086-request-smuggling-vulnerability)

Régis Leroy reported defects in Node.js that can make [request smuggling](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9.5) attacks possible under certain circumstances. To fix these defects, HTTP header parsing in Node.js, for both requests and responses, is moving closer to the formal HTTP specification in its handling of `Content-Length`.

While the impact of this vulnerability is application and network dependent, it is likely to be difficult to assess whether a Node.js deployment is vulnerable to attack. We therefore recommend that all users upgrade.

* Versions 0.10.x of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade to [v0.10.42 (Maintenance)](/en/blog/release/v0.10.42/).
* Versions 0.12.x of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade to [v0.12.10 (LTS)](/blo(/ease/v0.12.10/).
* Versions 4.x, including LTS Argon, of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade (/4.3.0 "Argon" (LTS)](/blog/release/v4.3.0/).
* Versions 5.x of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade to [v5.6.0 (Stable)](/en/blog/release/v5.6.0/).(/

### [CVE-2016-2216 Response Splitting Vulnerability](#cve-2016-2216-response-splitting-vulnerability)

Сковорода Никита Андреевич (Nikita Skovoroda / [@ChALkeR](https://github.com/chalker)) and Amit Klein (of [Safebreach](http://safebreach.com/)) separately reported ways in which HTTP header parsing in Node.js can be used to perform [response splitting](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9.4) attacks (new-line / CRLF injection). While Node.js has been protecting against response splitting attacks by checking for CRLF characters, it is possible to compose response headers using Unicode characters that decompose to these characters, bypassing the checks previously in place.

To fix this defect, HTTP header parsing in Node.js, for both requests and responses, is moving closer to the formal HTTP specification. HTTP headers containing characters outside of the [valid set for tokens](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html#sec2.2) will be rejected. This check is performed for both requests and responses, for Node.js HTTP servers and clients.

It is possible that there exist Node.js applications that rely on the lax behavior of HTTP header parsing for Node.js clients and/or servers. This change is therefore a breaking change that would normally be reserved for a semver-major version increment. However, as per our [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/) policy, we are introducing this change as a semver-minor in Node.js v4 (hence the move from v4.2.x to v4.3.x) and v5 and semver-patch in v0.10 and v0.12.

Node.js LTS releases, v0.10.42, v0.12.10 and v4.3.0 (but not v5.6.0) also include a new command-line argument that can be used to turn off this new strict header parsing. By supplying `--security-revert=CVE-2016-2216` when starting Node.js, the previous lenient HTTP header character checks will be used instead. Use of this option is not recommended and should only be used as a temporary migration tool where the implications of reverting the new behavior are fully understood.

We recommend that all users upgrade to receive this fix.

* Versions 0.10.x of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade to [v0.10.42 (Maintenance)](/en/blog/release/v0.10.42/).
* Versions 0.12.x of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade to [v0.12.10 (LTS)](/blo(/ease/v0.12.10/).
* Versions 4.x, including LTS Argon, of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade (/4.3.0 "Argon" (LTS)](/blog/release/v4.3.0/).
* Versions 5.x of Node.js are **vulnerable**, please upgrade to [v5.6.0 (Stable)](/en/blog/release/v5.6.0/).(/

### [OpenSSL upgrade summary](#openssl-upgrade-summary)

Node.js v0.10.42 and v0.12.10 upgrades the bundled version of OpenSSL from 1.0.1q to 1.0.1r. Full details can be found in the [OpenSSL 1.0.1 changelog](https://www.openssl.org/news/cl101.txt).

Node.js v4.3.0 and v5.6.0 upgrades the bundled version of OpenSSL from 1.0.2e to 1.0.2f. Full details can be found in the [OpenSSL 1.0.2 changelog](https://www.openssl.org/news/cl102.txt).

As per our [impact assessment](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nodejs-sec/G8IA0G4uA88/-UB4DpG1DwAJ), the following applies to these releases:

**DH small subgroups (CVE-2016-0701)**

Node.js v0.10 and v0.12 are not affected by this defect.

Node.js v4 and v5 use the `SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE` option already and are therefore not affected by this defect.

**SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers (CVE-2015-3197)**

Node.js v0.10 and v0.12 disable SSLv2 by default and are not affected *unless* the `--enable-ssl2` command line argument is being used (not recommended).

Node.js v4 and v5 do not support SSLv2.

**An update on DHE man-in-the-middle protection (Logjam)**

Previous releases of OpenSSL (since Node.js v0.10.39, v0.12.5, v4.0.0 and v5.0.0) mitigated against [Logjam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logjam_%28computer_security%29) for TLS *clients* by rejecting connections from servers where Diffie-Hellman parameters were shorter than 768-bits.

The new OpenSSL release, for all Node.js lines, increases this to 1024-bits. The change only impacts TLS clients connecting to servers with weak DH parameter lengths.

Please tune in to **nodejs-sec** (<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec>) to receive security announcements. An [Atom feed](/en/feed/vulnerability.xml) is also available for security-only posts to the [nodejs.org blog](/en/blog/).

OpenJS Foundation Trademark Policy

OpenJS Foundation

This is a statement of the
trademarks owned by the OpenJS Foundation and used by projects under the OpenJS Foundation.
Individual projects under the OpenJS Foundation may have additional guidelines and requirements for the
use of trademarks intended to imply compliance with certain criteria or other requirements, and in such
cases compliance with such criteria and requirements is necessary.

’s trademarks and its policy and guidelines relating to use of

For purposes of this document, references to trademarks or marks include all trade and service marks and
logos owned by the OpenJS Foundation legal entity. Projects operating as separately incorporated entities
managed by the OpenJS Foundation have their own trademarks, policies and usage guidelines.

The OpenJS Foundation’s Trademarks

A list of OpenJS Foundation’s registered trademarks, pending registrations and trademarks in use can be
found at
.  The current version of this trademark policy can be found at
https://trademark-policy.openjsf.org

https://trademark-list.openjsf.org

.

The OpenJS Foundation Trademark Usage Guidelines

Trademarks are used to provide assurance to the community of consistency with respect to the quality of
products or services with which the mark is associated. This policy attempts to strike the proper balance
between two competing interests: 1) the need of the OpenJS Foundation to ensure that its trademarks
remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they have been created to preserve and 2) the need of the
OpenJS Foundation to ensure that community members are able to discuss the projects with which the
OpenJS Foundation is associated and to accurately describe the relationship between the OpenJS
Foundation and the products and services offered by others.

Your right to use a mark of the OpenJS Foundation is provided for in this policy and in the statement of
permitted use, if any, that may accompany the trademark notice displayed on the website dedicated to the
project. A copyright license, even an open source copyright license, does not include an implied right or
license to use a trademark that may be related to the project developing the licensed software or other
materials. Because open source licenses permit unrestricted modification of the copyrighted software, and
the OpenJS Foundation has no intention of interfering with that right, your right to use any specific
trademark of the OpenJS Foundation is not determined by your use of software made available under an
open source license. Your right to use a mark is conditioned upon conforming to other requirements that
are directly related to the qualities that the specific mark has been created to preserve.

Proper use of the OpenJS Foundation trademarks by following these trademark usage guidelines protects
the value of the OpenJS Foundation trademarks. Any use of or reference to the OpenJS Foundation
trademarks that is inconsistent with this trademark policy, or use of marks that are confusingly similar to
trademarks of the OpenJS Foundation, is prohibited. All uses of the OpenJS Foundation trademarks, and
all goodwill associated therewith, will inure solely to the benefit of the OpenJS Foundation.

​
​
​
​
​

Rules that Apply to OpenJS Trademarks

There are some basic rules that apply to any use of any trade or service mark of the OpenJS Foundation,
without the express permission of the OpenJS Foundation.

● A trademark must never be used as a verb or noun. A trademark must be used only as an adjective

followed by the generic name/noun.

● A trademark must not be used in the plural or possessive form.

● A trademark must not be altered or amended in any way. A mark must not be combined with any
other mark, hyphenated, abbreviated or displayed in parts. A trademark that is depicted as two or
more words must not be compressed into one word. A logo must not be displayed with color
variations, or with other elements superimposed on top of the logo.

● A trademark must not be used as your domain name or as part of your domain name.

● A trademark must not be used as part of your product name.

● A trademark must not be incorporated into your company's logos or designs.

● A trademark notice must be used on the most prominent and/or first appearance of each mark of
the OpenJS Foundation, and a trademark notice should not be changed. In particular, a ™ should
not be changed to an ® in a trademark notice by anyone other than the owner. If you are unsure
about whether a mark of the OpenJS Foundation is registered in your country, please contact us
for additional guidance as to what trademark symbol you should use.

There are also some basic rights that everyone has to use any trademark, which are often referred to as
“fair use,” and the OpenJS Foundation does not intend to restrict those rights. You may make fair use of
word marks to make true factual statements. But fair use does not permit you to state or imply that the
owner of a mark produces, endorses, or supports your company, products, or services. Even when making
fair use of a trademark, you must acknowledge the owner of the trademark with a trademark notice, such
as the notice displayed on the OpenJS Foundation project websites.

Rules and Policies Applicable to Marks Owned by the OpenJS
Foundation

In addition to the generally applicable rules discussed above, there are a few specific rules that we require
everyone to follow when using trademarks owned by the OpenJS Foundation.

● Use the full form of any trademarks (e.g., “OpenJS Foundation”) in the first reference in all

documents of mass communication, including marketing collateral and web pages. You may then
use any abbreviated or short form references (e.g. “OpenJSF”) within the same document where
the full form has already been used.

● Use the OpenJS Foundation’s trademarks in a form that distinguishes them from the text around

them, such as by capitalization, bold or italic fonts, or with quotation marks. Any use of

2

registered trademarks listed above should include the ® symbol immediately after the first usage
(e.g., “JQuery® is a JavaScript library designed to ….”). Any use of unregistered trademarks
listed above should include a ™ immediately after the first usage (e.g., “Chassis™ creates open
standards designed for CSS libraries ….”)

● Do not use the OpenJS Foundation trademarks in a manner that would disparage the OpenJS

Foundation or its projects (e.g., untruthful advertising, false/misleading promotional materials,
etc.).

● Do not use OpenJS Foundation logos on the cover of a book or magazine without written

permission from the OpenJS Foundation.

● Do not use the OpenJS Foundation trademarks more prominently than your own company,

product or service name.

● Do not use a logo of the OpenJS Foundation on posters, brochures, signs, websites, crowdfunding
sites, or other marketing materials to promote your events, products or services without written
permission from the OpenJS Foundation.

● Do not refer to a product or service as being certified under any of the OpenJS Foundation’s

marks unless your company has successfully undergone the requisite compliance testing and has
explicit authorization to use such terms from the OpenJS Foundation.

● Do not attempt to claim or assert any ownership rights in any mark of the OpenJS Foundation and
do not attempt to register any OpenJS Foundation trademark as a trademark, trade name, domain
name, or “doing business as” name, alone or (unless specifically licensed) in combination with
your own trademarks.

The OpenJS Foundation marks have been created and their use is expressly permitted for a specific
purpose. Do not use logos or names of the OpenJS Foundation in any commercial or marketing context
other than as expressly permitted in this policy unless you have obtained explicit written permission from
the OpenJS Foundation to do so. The OpenJS Foundation permits the use of its trademarks for private and
personal use to make t-shirts, stickers, and caps for yourself and your friends (meaning people from
whom you don’t receive anything of value in return) in a manner that is consistent with the preservation
of the goodwill and value of the mark.

You are also allowed to use a trademark or logo of the OpenJS Foundation as a link to the home page of
the applicable project or to a web page on the OpenJS Foundation web site that is relevant to the reference
so long as the link is in a manner that is consistent with the preservation of the goodwill and value of the
mark. The link and all other usage of a logo of the OpenJS Foundation shall be done using the official
versions of the OpenJS Foundation logos obtained from the OpenJS Foundation or its projects.

Here are examples of correct and incorrect uses of a logo of the OpenJS Foundation (noting that any
actual use must also comply with the other requirements described herein):

3

Correct

Incorrect (must not change colors)

Incorrect (must not change design elements)

Incorrect (must not change aspect)

Certain marks of the OpenJS Foundation have been created to enable you to communicate compatibility
or interoperability of software or products. In addition to the requirement that any use of a mark to make
an assertion of compatibility must, of course, be accurate, the use of these marks must avoid confusion
regarding the OpenJS Foundation’s association with the product. The use of the mark cannot be used to
imply that the OpenJS Foundation or its projects are sponsoring or endorsing the product. The following
are examples of proper and improper usage of these trademarks of the OpenJS Foundation:

● Correct: <your product name> for <the OpenJS Foundation mark>

● Correct: <your product/company name> plug-in for <the OpenJS Foundation mark>

● Correct: <your product name> compatible with <the OpenJS Foundation mark>

● Correct: <your product name> for use with <the OpenJS Foundation mark>

● Correct: Quick Start for <the OpenJS Foundation mark> by <your company name>

● Incorrect: <the OpenJS Foundation mark> <your product name>

4

● Incorrect: <the OpenJS Foundation mark> by <your company name>

● Incorrect: <the OpenJS Foundation mark> - <your product name>

● Incorrect: <your product/company name> - <the OpenJS Foundation mark>

● Incorrect: <the OpenJS Foundation mark> Quick Start by <your company name>

OpenJS Foundation Trademarks and Crowdfunding

The OpenJS Foundation recognizes that some projects may wish to use a project trademark when raising
funds through crowdfunding platforms. These activities are not official OpenJS Foundation efforts, even
if they are coordinated by core participants from our projects. Because crowdfunding is an individual
activity organized outside of the OpenJS Foundation, you must ask permission to use an OpenJS
Foundation trademark on a crowdfunding page.

In exchange for using the mark, the OpenJS Foundation requires the administrator of the crowdfunding
effort to adhere to these three policies:

1) You must have a policy that contributors and recipients disclose their legal or known names and

company affiliations to the administrator of the funds.

2) Projects must be clear about how they decide to distribute funds to individual contributors.

3) You must include the following disclaimer on the crowdfunding page, replacing [Project Name]

with the name of the project whose logo you plan to use:

This crowdfunding page is run by and for the benefit of the independent contributors to the
[Project Name] open source software project. This crowdfunding page is not endorsed or
administered by OpenJS Foundation, Inc. (the “OpenJS Foundation”), the OpenJS Foundation
does not receive and has no control over any funds contributed, the OpenJS Foundation does not
direct or otherwise supervise the actions of any contributor to the [Project Name] project, and all
donations made will be expended for the private benefit of or otherwise to reimburse individuals
that do not have an employer/employee, contractor, or other agency relationship with the OpenJS
Foundation. The [Project Name] marks used herein are used under license from the OpenJS
Foundation for the benefit of the open source software community.

To request permission to use a mark, please contact

info@openjsf.org

.

Finally, if you are raising money through crowdfunding, be aware that you are not acting on behalf of the
OpenJS Foundation. It is your responsibility to know and follow all applicable laws.

Questions, Comments, Concerns

We look to our community to help us retain the value of the OpenJS Foundation’s trade and service
marks. If you have questions with respect to these guidelines or to report concerns regarding the use or

5

​
​
misuse of a trademark of the OpenJS Foundation, or to obtain written permission for a proposed use of the
OpenJS Foundation trademarks, contact

info@openjsf.org

.

Disclaimer

The OpenJS Foundation does not make any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to the
warranties of non-infringement of any third party intellectual property rights. The OpenJS Foundation
does not warrant that any pending trademark applications for trademarks of the OpenJS Foundation will
result in any granted trademark protection. The OpenJS Foundation shall not be liable for any claims
relating to user’s activities falling within the scope of the permission and user hereby agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold the OpenJS Foundation and its contributors harmless against any such claims.

Updates

The OpenJS Foundation may release new versions of the OpenJS Foundation trademark policy or
statements of permitted use of the OpenJS Foundation marks from time to time without notice.
