[00:00] [Music]
[00:02] front row is always empty
[00:04] we continue their responsible disclosure
[00:07] process
[00:08] session we had one very interesting case
[00:11] study in as the first talk and now get
[00:15] off solo yours or very long time partner
[00:19] and IT security researcher will talk
[00:23] about
[00:24] cameras another interesting tool on
[00:28] device welcome
[00:30] [Applause]
[00:36] good night everybody
[00:39] so yeah we will I will actually talk
[00:42] about two different things so this is
[00:45] actually a presentation that includes
[00:50] quite quite a different angles and it
[00:53] has three parts even so I will start by
[00:57] discussing some specific vulnerabilities
[00:59] for some specific cameras those are
[01:03] actually those are actually
[01:06] CV registered five of our abilities of
[01:09] them and this is today is the day I'm
[01:11] just closing them for the first time so
[01:12] that the technical part we will also
[01:15] have a short hopefully sure short and
[01:18] sweet demo of those vulnerabilities and
[01:21] then I hope to talk in the end about the
[01:24] responsible disclosure process itself
[01:26] and
[01:27] how it's been doing for the specific for
[01:31] the specific example and my general
[01:35] recommendations and general conclusions
[01:37] for from responsible slaughtered process
[01:39] as a whole
[01:40] so
[01:42] let's just start with something simple
[01:46] okay mean one slide so just a quick
[01:50] background about me I am an IT security
[01:52] expert I'm and I'm a researcher and
[01:55] owner of Latin IT security company
[01:57] called first limited
[02:01] my skills range quite a substance from
[02:05] technical two more two more political I
[02:08] started as a programmer at age of seven
[02:11] but I got word of that through after
[02:13] 10-15 years so currently i specialize in
[02:18] live network flow analysis Network
[02:20] forensics I also do reverse engineering
[02:21] social engineering penetration testing
[02:23] for our clients of course
[02:25] security incident investigation
[02:28] unfortunately in our world we cannot
[02:30] really live without that security
[02:32] incidents happen and they need to be
[02:33] investigated and I've also had an
[02:36] experience with the legal dimension of
[02:38] cyber security and cyber defense
[02:40] well when I was when I started to make
[02:44] this presentation I mean I looked it to
[02:46] myself and and I considered okay i liked
[02:50] responsible special process i like the
[02:52] participant intellect the result but
[02:55] when I got to making the last slide I
[02:56] actually looked back at everything
[02:59] that's happening and I understood that
[03:00] well
[03:01] it's it's not as easy and as sweet as it
[03:05] should be there's possible closure
[03:06] process I mean so
[03:09] let's go to the first part of the
[03:11] presentation the
[03:13] the cameras right so
[03:17] it was every security research
[03:22] independent researchers somehow choose
[03:24] their topics and for this topic I didn't
[03:27] specifically go against after this
[03:28] vendor or after security cameras as such
[03:32] you know so we were just we were just
[03:35] working on an exercise and we were
[03:37] discussing you know physical security
[03:39] seems seems kind of nice topic to teach
[03:42] people right so
[03:43] let's teach them physical security so
[03:45] how can we do it
[03:47] let's find some physical secure device
[03:50] introduce some artificial weaknesses in
[03:53] there and
[03:54] well make them find those weaknesses so
[03:57] they you know
[03:59] our
[04:01] original point out where we departed on
[04:04] this project was we started with the
[04:07] idea that okay physical security for
[04:09] physical security systems cyber security
[04:10] is probably very tight and and we will
[04:14] not have any animal nur abilities in
[04:16] there so we will take a product will add
[04:18] similar abilities ourselves just so that
[04:20] are our people participating in
[04:22] trainings I thought I can get a feel
[04:24] that well cyber security is important in
[04:26] security products even even if those
[04:28] vulnerabilities aren't real
[04:29] so I said sure bring me a professional
[04:33] security camera a good one you know not
[04:36] that
[04:37] not the ones that you can get it can get
[04:40] an ebay for twenty dollars or fifty
[04:41] dollars the ones that are actually being
[04:44] deployed by professional security
[04:45] companies so okay a colleague brought me
[04:50] a professional security camera this one
[04:54] they go for about 300 euros i started
[04:58] about 300 euros so it's not a domestic
[05:00] product it is actually a professional
[05:02] security product I would say
[05:05] well but before introducing a weakness
[05:09] of course it is always a smart idea to
[05:11] first check if maybe maybe just maybe
[05:14] there are any pre-existing weakness
[05:16] isn't there so that's what we did
[05:21] possible approaches to go about that if
[05:23] you want to do it yourself it's all
[05:26] about the firmware so one thing you can
[05:29] do is connect to the serial port on your
[05:31] device the debug port and dump it by
[05:34] using the features of the bootloader so
[05:36] you can get the firmware and you can
[05:38] start taking a look at it oh
[05:41] yeah my demo is ready finally I was
[05:43] rebooting my computer okay so the second
[05:46] second possibility is to
[05:50] find the firmware online luckily many
[05:55] vendors publish firmware updates or even
[05:58] initial firmers online you can take a
[05:59] look at it it's usually encrypted you
[06:01] can try to decrypt it and and and then
[06:04] you can go from there a similar firmware
[06:07] will usually suffice especially in any
[06:10] Internet of Things
[06:11] era many vendors share some base of
[06:16] their firmware so you don't need you do
[06:18] not need to find specifically st. firmer
[06:20] and with these cameras that's exactly
[06:23] the problem the vendor decided that it
[06:26] is a good idea
[06:28] to approach the security product from
[06:32] perspective of a low security level in
[06:35] terms of things device
[06:37] basically they got they got the hardware
[06:40] they have the good price tag but their
[06:43] software site or rather the firmware
[06:45] side is
[06:46] well it's worth 10 euros you know if you
[06:50] have to pay for that it's not worth much
[06:51] so the approaches is not that good it's
[06:55] sloppy it's a sloppy approach one that
[06:57] you would find in an IOT refrigerator
[07:00] rather than a security camera so and of
[07:02] course you can always try to attack it
[07:05] over the network you can you can try and
[07:08] see maybe you can just get in and and
[07:09] it's a scary part i mean if you then do
[07:11] the first two and you're successful one
[07:13] on the last one which was the case with
[07:16] this camera actually even though I was
[07:18] trying different approaches at the same
[07:19] time well it means anybody can do that
[07:22] right
[07:24] so likely result by doing that
[07:27] will be that your peace of mind that the
[07:31] security product should provide will be
[07:33] actually replaced by additional worries
[07:36] like privacy crushing CVE 2357
[07:41] potentially fatal cv23 556 that cripples
[07:45] availability
[07:47] cv23 59 that allows anyone to do
[07:50] anything with your security device
[07:52] hidden users with blank password
[07:54] provided by CV 2358 and disabled where
[07:58] jobs could only check so at least I did
[07:59] that
[08:00] and of course cv23 to 360 which is a
[08:06] back door with superuser privileges so
[08:09] let's take a look at that the Chinese
[08:12] cert asked me not to disclose proof is
[08:16] proof of concept just yet
[08:18] so I didn't except for the first one
[08:21] because it's it's it's a really simple
[08:24] so
[08:25] so for the first time i present to you
[08:28] see ve 2016 2 3 5 7 mile side cameras
[08:33] contain hard coded ssl private key all
[08:35] of them
[08:36] hashes are the same for for all those
[08:40] cameras which means even if camera
[08:44] administrator is using https you can
[08:46] successfully do a mental attack on that
[08:48] without raising a warning even if they
[08:50] have pins a certificate
[08:53] as an additional bonus if you happen to
[08:55] get on the system without root you can
[08:57] change the certificates whatever a user
[09:00] is
[09:00] after you start the camera which is not
[09:03] a problem by the way as we will see in
[09:04] in some of the next one burner abilities
[09:06] so for those of you who still haven't
[09:09] noticed this is going to be fast paced
[09:10] talks a lot of lots of information in
[09:12] just 30 minutes sorry about that
[09:15] 2 3 5 6
[09:17] miles at cameras are vulnerable to a
[09:19] buffer overflow of username password
[09:22] fields so if you request the CGI script
[09:24] on the camera and combined length of
[09:27] HTTP user name and password is more than
[09:29] 31 symbols rings a bell right
[09:31] 31
[09:34] camera crashes the web server part and
[09:37] it is indicative of a buffer overflow I
[09:40] for today actually made a bit more
[09:44] advanced demo and it seems I've actually
[09:47] got proof of our overflow before it was
[09:49] just just a scientific guesstimate that
[09:51] there is a buffer overflows that was
[09:53] crashing and and now I made a demo that
[09:55] proves that let's hope that part works
[09:58] 2359 let me take a look at the clock
[10:01] here ok
[10:04] mouth had cameras do not properly
[10:07] authenticate command submitted to cgi
[10:09] bin so there is a file called vb HTM on
[10:13] the camera it basically
[10:15] allows user to control different
[10:20] functions of the camera itself so not
[10:21] that not underlying system not the
[10:23] services but the camera itself like
[10:24] zooming adding a user
[10:26] rebooting the system maybe and it has
[10:31] some unprivileged commands which work
[10:33] with any user or even without a user
[10:34] name and there are most of them are
[10:36] privileged you need to be a user of one
[10:39] of three levels 0 1 or 2 with 0 being
[10:41] the highest
[10:42] do to do a command but there's a bug if
[10:46] you somehow manage to submit to actions
[10:49] at the same time
[10:50] it looks for the least privileged action
[10:52] and checks privilege for that so if you
[10:54] submit an action that requires no
[10:56] privilege and additionally and the other
[10:58] action it it will succeed in executing
[11:02] those actions
[11:07] 2 3 5 8
[11:09] hard-coded default credentials so of
[11:12] course most products come with some
[11:15] default passwords only recently we see
[11:17] some routers coming with generated
[11:19] passwords but still if you if you can
[11:21] find the algorithm you can find and
[11:22] understand what what the password might
[11:25] be coming for example from a mac address
[11:27] or serial address but most devices in
[11:31] IOT sphere do come with some default
[11:34] passwords on and that's okay as long as
[11:36] users change them right but additionally
[11:39] here so camera supports of maximum 10
[11:42] different users and
[11:44] somehow well you know if there and it
[11:47] comes with three users from the factory
[11:48] so you have seven more users with empty
[11:52] usernames and empty passwords
[11:54] without authority bit set to zero so if
[11:57] you manage to find the right spot in the
[11:59] camera to put that in then you can do
[12:02] anything basically
[12:04] ways out a username and password but
[12:07] that is their homework right they made
[12:08] the javascript check that that doesn't
[12:10] allow you to do that over the web
[12:11] interface so we're safe there
[12:14] it was 360 next we're building
[12:19] muscle mouth had cameras have a
[12:22] vulnerable version throw beer so an old
[12:24] version 0.5 3.1 it's about well it has I
[12:29] think three or four vulnerabilities but
[12:32] it's not the most interesting part so
[12:35] the most interesting part is that as far
[12:38] as I can tell there is a backdoor I mean
[12:42] it is a back door because the port for
[12:44] for this ssh server is not the standard
[12:47] port and it has a root user and it has a
[12:52] password which is set to share value for
[12:55] all cameras all comers I could find
[12:56] during my my testing all four American
[12:59] fund inherent it's it's all the same so
[13:01] the first 16 characters of the line is
[13:04] here so this is a salt the password
[13:06] follows and created password of course
[13:07] so well if you if you want to get the
[13:09] password you're welcome to to buy a
[13:11] camera and and take a look or wait until
[13:13] the Chinese say that will we wait it
[13:16] enough and
[13:17] we can show the path of the world but
[13:18] it's not that hard anyway okay so it is
[13:21] demo time
[13:31] so if the video signal works correctly
[13:34] then we should get a nice a nice demo oh
[13:39] yeah great great great
[13:42] okay so let's start just by connecting
[13:45] to the camera and opening a web page
[13:48] so for this part I will need a creative
[13:51] volunteer from the audience is there
[13:52] someone who feels particularly creative
[13:54] right now we will not have you you will
[13:57] not have to say anything if you don't
[13:58] want to just and just need you at the
[13:59] keyboard here come on anyone let's not
[14:02] let's not spend the extra minutes who
[14:05] want to do that
[14:07] okay very good thank you
[14:10] okay so i will log in here now into the
[14:14] camera
[14:15] okay
[14:17] there is a there is a feature that
[14:20] allows to change the password this is a
[14:21] standard feature you're welcome so what
[14:23] I would like you to do is change the
[14:25] password for for administrator just just
[14:27] make sure you press on edit below
[14:29] there's an edit icon at the very bottom
[14:32] yes and now I just type the new password
[14:35] two times
[14:36] so in in the field above
[14:40] yes yes yes yeah that that is correct
[14:44] there just just type 2 times make sure I
[14:46] don't see it but be ready that everyone
[14:49] else will see it at the end of the
[14:50] presentation but make it secure
[14:58] okay can you save please
[15:08] okay it seems it worked
[15:11] well I hope so yeah we're good just 44
[15:16] I'm just impressed look out here just in
[15:17] case it didn't plug out fully thank you
[15:19] for much around of applause for
[15:20] volunteer
[15:21] [Applause]
[15:24] okay now if I try to log in with my
[15:28] previous credentials here I
[15:30] can't do that so that's unfortunate but
[15:33] i do have five vulnerabilities i can use
[15:36] so let's use let's use one of them let's
[15:39] let's do this
[15:41] okay so
[15:54] okay so two commands were scheduled
[15:57] executed an unprivileged command in
[15:59] privileged one good let's try to view
[16:02] the video now let's see it as we
[16:04] apparently we can't get in with with the
[16:06] old password so but we just made a user
[16:09] for ourselves
[16:13] let's see if it works
[16:20] okay so we got a feed from somewhere huh
[16:24] cool isn't it well not much to see here
[16:26] fortunately otherwise the state data
[16:30] inspection would be on my back okay so
[16:34] let's okay let's say we don't want to
[16:37] modify anything on the camera let's say
[16:39] we want to be stealthy and and we don't
[16:42] want any users one of the
[16:44] vulnerabilities can be used to actually
[16:46] try and take a look at the configuration
[16:48] file and from there you can of course
[16:49] extract the users
[16:53] so i made a handy strip that is that
[16:56] that does everything automatically
[17:01] okay is that your password ok so there's
[17:05] admin passwords there's the user we
[17:06] added
[17:07] there's a third user blank user and
[17:10] blank password and admin so the the the
[17:14] camera was set securely I mean besides
[17:16] the admin password everything possible
[17:17] was done to secure the camera extra
[17:20] users were removed and that's that's
[17:22] where where this is from so there were
[17:24] two extra users besides admin and it was
[17:26] deleted and we have a blank users there
[17:28] now which is why we can actually do this
[17:30] exploit here
[17:34] again two more two more demos um
[17:39] well this is not not not an interesting
[17:42] one but we can crush the web server
[17:43] right
[17:44] just in case we want to
[17:50] okay so instead of whatever we need to
[17:53] get we got an end to your flight from
[17:55] server let's run it again
[17:58] can't connect so web interface it down
[18:01] and finally let's say we want to
[18:09] you know do something useful
[18:20] okay
[18:26] let's let's see it's not my computer so
[18:29] there there are some you know small
[18:32] small partitions there are 30 megabytes
[18:33] so it's clearly not not a laptop let's
[18:36] take a look at the process list so we
[18:38] see some out dividual server we see some
[18:41] dropbear we see web server or web server
[18:43] backup so
[18:46] we're root inside the camera finally
[18:49] let's try the last part let's track
[18:52] extracting users again and I'm not sure
[18:54] this will work as I only only made made
[18:58] this proof-of-concept yesterday for the
[19:00] first time in my life yeah it worked so
[19:06] data got corrupted
[19:08] because
[19:10] by the virtue of crashing the web
[19:12] service and it being a buffer overflow
[19:17] it actually overwrote part of the user
[19:21] table and we can see it here clearly so
[19:24] that's everything for the demo thank you
[19:26] much for this part let's move on with
[19:29] the presentation
[19:42] okay so let's let's recap why this is
[19:45] important
[19:47] this is not a ten dollar twenty dollar
[19:50] device that the user will just buy and
[19:52] and set up to monitor their their cats
[19:56] or their dogs or something more
[19:58] important home this is a
[19:59] professional-grade device okay its
[20:01] mid-range price price level is mid range
[20:05] but still it's a professional device
[20:06] used by security professionals and these
[20:09] are quite severe bugs for such a device
[20:12] so it is important they get fixed well
[20:16] so how did the manufacturer react when I
[20:21] tried to get this fixed so
[20:23] vulnerability was actually discovered by
[20:26] me in November 2015 and
[20:29] and that's one of the things I want to
[20:31] talk to you about it's been almost a
[20:33] year and
[20:34] it's hard not seeing
[20:37] the work you do
[20:40] do any good for society for a whole year
[20:44] so that's the hard part of responsible
[20:47] other process if the vendor of
[20:49] manufacture is slow to respond so all
[20:52] the dates here are in weeks since I
[20:55] found out about the vulnerability first
[20:58] first five or six weeks I spent trying
[21:00] to manually contact them after ten weeks
[21:02] and with some help from from different
[21:05] friends in the industry I finally got
[21:08] email address of their CEO or president
[21:10] so ten weeks after I discovered
[21:13] vulnerabilities tried to contact them so
[21:16] this is what what he said I have
[21:19] forwarded your information to the
[21:20] appropriate party if there's an
[21:22] interested someone will contact you I
[21:24] thought well okay that's that's cool I
[21:27] mean at that point it never crossed my
[21:31] mind but you know some
[21:33] telling telling this story beginning of
[21:36] this week because the disclosure
[21:37] announced disclosure date was first act
[21:39] Ober so I I actually finally had the
[21:41] possibility to talk to some people about
[21:43] my research here this week they said
[21:47] well you should have just gone you know
[21:49] Two and and sold vulnerable OT on on the
[21:52] on the gray market which apparently by
[21:53] some lawyers
[21:55] some lawyers say it's legal you know
[21:57] because you don't explicitly just sell
[21:59] it and and good guys use it they say you
[22:01] know governments and say all our friends
[22:03] right
[22:05] anyway so
[22:08] it's ten weeks from Laura bility
[22:11] 36 weeks later from the beginning they
[22:15] finally safe we will fix this in two
[22:17] weeks okay perfect four weeks later
[22:20] they say we will have a fixed ready by
[22:24] the end of the month well okay so
[22:28] they miss the deadline again but just by
[22:30] bit so finally 44 45 weeks after a
[22:34] vulnerability was discovered by me they
[22:37] fixed it so
[22:39] this week beginning of this week I i
[22:41] went to the web page and it seems yet
[22:44] it's all fixed now so apparently you can
[22:46] go to the web page you can find out
[22:47] their skype account you can scamp them
[22:49] and get the patch I wasn't successful in
[22:51] that but it was like if I say they fixed
[22:53] it well then they probably have fixed
[22:54] that so whoever has mouth had cameras at
[22:57] home or in their company go download I
[23:00] mean good guy emailed them
[23:02] so third part of my presentation real
[23:05] quick the responsibles closure process
[23:08] it was it wasn't just sitting around
[23:11] waiting for a year for this to get fixed
[23:13] it was actively poking poking people
[23:16] using your contacts and trying trying to
[23:18] get this this fixed so I a huge credit
[23:23] to serve the till we who who actually
[23:26] contact the Chinese national
[23:28] vulnerability database and it was only
[23:30] possible because they met them
[23:31] physically in person or before that they
[23:34] weren't too eager to respond and then
[23:36] see and VD where such a Chinese see
[23:38] anybody we're trying to to push push the
[23:41] vendor to push fix miles that is
[23:43] actually an American company that does
[23:45] all their research and development to
[23:48] China
[23:50] one more thing that that I think also
[23:52] helped in this case is because a couple
[23:56] months after I discovered the
[23:57] vulnerability I
[23:58] discovered that
[24:00] quite a large governmental institution
[24:03] in Latvia had installed some of those
[24:06] cameras
[24:07] and so I went to circle vient okay so we
[24:12] have this problem problem in latvia and
[24:14] i would i would think it made them a bit
[24:16] a bit more worried about about this
[24:18] china american bug that actually has
[24:20] local impact
[24:22] so I
[24:24] also contacted hacker one they actually
[24:27] initially were the ones who who gave me
[24:29] contact from outside so that's a great
[24:31] service they have they provide
[24:33] vulnerability contact assistance service
[24:35] and also finally I contacted sources he
[24:38] also tracker one they have they have a
[24:41] profile there ok so lessons learned
[24:43] let's see I think I'm running out of
[24:45] time
[24:47] don't locate these five vulnerabilities
[24:50] was less than 24 hours time to get them
[24:53] fixed were 48 weeks and I do not
[24:57] honestly believe that they're completely
[24:58] fixed guy I well I wasn't able to verify
[25:00] that but I'm taking their word so let's
[25:03] hope it's true
[25:07] actual response disclosure as compared
[25:09] to responsible closure on paper because
[25:11] I have been quite involved in different
[25:14] responsible for policy processes and
[25:16] also including here in Latvia the actual
[25:19] disclosure isn't as sweet as the one on
[25:22] paper it can get quite messy and complex
[25:24] you have to wait around you have to poke
[25:27] people and and of course at at the very
[25:31] beginning since we don't have a hard
[25:33] framework in the world for that you you
[25:35] always you always have to consider are
[25:37] they gonna are they when one talk to me
[25:39] or will they send their lawyers like
[25:41] skype did for me for example or will
[25:43] they try to send police after me like
[25:46] when Latvian company tried to so it's
[25:50] it's quite risky so what we have to
[25:53] think about and we're going to talk
[25:55] about recommendations in next slide is
[25:56] how to make response disclosure more
[25:58] more attractive to researchers because I
[26:01] think we're at the point where
[26:02] researchers are participating and the
[26:05] amount may be declining soon not
[26:08] increasing because of the complexity
[26:10] complexity of respond to disclosure and
[26:12] lack of clear contact points all all
[26:15] over the world of course is a challenge
[26:17] to doing disclosure over national
[26:20] borders so for security officers inside
[26:23] a company my recommendations are you
[26:25] should brace yourself reports are coming
[26:27] they will be there soon you should be
[26:31] ready to process responsible disclosure
[26:32] policy or process reports even if you
[26:36] haven't published the policy they will
[26:38] still be coming just a question if
[26:40] you're going to be ready and it's better
[26:42] that they are I mean because because bad
[26:44] guys are going to be researching you
[26:45] anyway so it's better that you that you
[26:48] ready to to collaborate as a good ones
[26:50] better yet of course publish a policy to
[26:53] help everybody just to follow for
[26:55] example sweatbox example
[26:59] think about incentives what could
[27:01] motivate a hacker to go to you rather
[27:03] than to a gray market vendor there have
[27:06] been different
[27:08] different schools of thoughts regarding
[27:10] whether you should do this on a monetary
[27:14] basis whether you can compete with gray
[27:16] or even black market levels but okay I
[27:18] for one I would never I would never go
[27:20] to a black market but if grey market you
[27:23] know it is this possibilities I convince
[27:26] me that it's legal you help your country
[27:28] hey why not so
[27:30] it's it's it's really
[27:33] it is it is really a challenge there to
[27:37] keep the good guys on the good side
[27:40] streamlined process might help you know
[27:42] where where a researcher can actually do
[27:44] research or our sudden spate is rather
[27:46] than spend a year doing some micro
[27:49] management and convince your she sees
[27:52] sorry convince your she chief financial
[27:55] officer that investing in cyber security
[27:57] is worst it finally for policymakers
[28:01] ensure that efficient cooperation
[28:04] platform is available for working not
[28:06] with actors not only inside of you but
[28:09] also outside it is not normal to expect
[28:13] emergency response team to be physically
[28:16] in contact with another another team
[28:19] from China how often does it meet twice
[28:20] a year once a year once in two years we
[28:23] need some framework there we need to
[28:25] promote fair values because I'm not
[28:28] going to talk about values in China
[28:30] about product and quality it's a whole
[28:32] different presentation establish clear
[28:34] contact points and governmental brokers
[28:37] that help to fix the vulnerability
[28:39] rather than exploited
[28:41] require cyber safety for all relevant
[28:44] products not unlike we have for food
[28:47] food safety
[28:49] vehicle safety electronics density we
[28:52] already have these things so since there
[28:55] is no motivation for vendors to invest
[28:57] in cybersecurity I think it's time let's
[29:01] start with Europe European government
[29:03] should mandate security because we are
[29:06] all accustomed to these things having
[29:07] some mandated security requirements why
[29:09] can't we have that for internet active
[29:11] devices I
[29:12] will leave you with that thought so if I
[29:16] still have time for any questions that
[29:17] would be happy to take them thank you
[29:18] much
[29:21] [Applause]
[29:31] questions really no
[29:36] heels and can you make in the situation
[29:40] when
[29:41] such kind of level of security camera
[29:44] will be Lissa T available over the
[29:46] Internet not behind the firewalls and
[29:49] internal networks yes about thousands of
[29:54] these are easily findable with
[29:56] what press calls google for hackers
[30:03] well a thousand of them
[30:07] but I don't think by far that it's
[30:10] everything because I didn't wanna you
[30:11] know go there and poker out and just
[30:13] throw it in it one keyword one possible
[30:15] way to find them so I will guess it's at
[30:17] least 10 times more publicly available
[30:18] over the Internet
[30:23] any any more questions
[30:29] thank you very much
[30:40] [Music]

# Vulnerabilities of Milesight IP security cameras

[2016-11-14](https://possiblesecurity.com/news/vulnerabilities-of-milesight-ip-security-cameras/ "Permalink to Vulnerabilities of Milesight IP security cameras")[Announcements](https://possiblesecurity.com/news/category/announcements/), [Security](https://possiblesecurity.com/news/category/security/)[CERT.LV](https://possiblesecurity.com/news/tag/cert-lv-en/), [conference](https://possiblesecurity.com/news/tag/conference/), [ENISA](https://possiblesecurity.com/news/tag/enisa/)[Kirils Solovjovs](https://possiblesecurity.com/news/author/k/ "View all posts by Kirils Solovjovs")

Internet of Things is becoming ever more popular, and vendors seek to capitalize on that: nowadays the manufacturing process of some security cameras is more alike to that of an Internet of Things device, rather than a security device. This reckless attitude undoubtedly leads to security vulnerabilities in critical systems.

Our lead researcher [Kirils Solovjovs](https://twitter.com/KirilsSolovjovs) participated in [IT security conference “Cyberchess 2016”](https://cert.lv/en/2016/09/it-security-conference-cyberchess-2016) jointly organised by [CERT.LV](https://cert.lv/en) and [ISACA Latvia](http://isaca.lv/), where he presented his research on the security of Milesight IP security cameras. Multiple major security vulnerabilities were presented (CVE-2016-2356, CVE-2016-2357, CVE-2016-2358, CVE-2016-2359, CVE-2016-2360). The presence of vulnerabilities in the wild was verified in cooperation with CERT.LV by testing a Latvian public institution with more than 100 products by this vendor.

Given that vendor is located outside EU, Kirils initiated an international responsible disclosure process, working with the vendor, CERT.LV, the public institution, the installer, HackerOne Inc., and CERT/CC.

[The presentation](http://kirils.org/slides/2016-10-06_Milesight_initial.pdf) covers the technical aspects of vulnerabilities (presented publicly for the first time), lessons learned, and recommendations to security officers and policy makers. [Video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scckkI7CAW0) is also available.
