Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the username and password fields within the Milesight IP camera's CGI script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:**  The CGI script handling user authentication is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when the combined length of the HTTP username and password exceeds 31 characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending an overly long username and password, an attacker can crash the web server component of the camera, effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** The presenter mentioned that the overflow was further analyzed after the initial discovery, and it was confirmed to be a buffer overflow. The presenter demonstrated that the buffer overflow overwrites parts of the user table in memory, suggesting the potential to overwrite other areas of memory and potentially achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the camera's CGI script, embedding a username and password string exceeding the buffer's limit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the camera, making it exploitable remotely or from within the same network as the vulnerable camera.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**

- The presentation mentions that the vulnerability was initially discovered in November 2015, and the vendor was slow to respond, with a fix finally released after 44-45 weeks.
- The presenter also highlighted that this vulnerability was present in professional-grade security cameras, not just low-cost consumer devices.
- The presenter stated they made a demo that proves the existence of the buffer overflow beyond just causing a crash.
- The vulnerability was part of a larger set of vulnerabilities discovered in these cameras.
