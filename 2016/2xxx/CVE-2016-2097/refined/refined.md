    "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in Action View in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.2 and 4.x before 4.1.14.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files by leveraging an application's unrestricted use of the render method and providing a .. (dot dot) in a pathname. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-0752.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2016-0752 resulted in a directory traversal vulnerability.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "Directory traversal"
      ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can read arbitrary files, potentially leading to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted request with '..' sequences in the pathname to the render method.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker, no authentication required.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is due to the improper sanitization of user-supplied input to the `render` method, which can lead to reading files outside of the intended view directory. Applications passing unverified user input to the `render` method are vulnerable."
