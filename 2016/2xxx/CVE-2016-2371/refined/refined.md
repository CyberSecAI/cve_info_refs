Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-2371:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write issue within the `mxit_parse_cmd_extprofile()` function of Pidgin. This function is responsible for handling extended profile packets received via the MXit protocol.
- The issue arises from using a user-controlled value (the `count` variable, derived from data received from the server) as the boundary for a loop and to calculate an index into an array. This index is then used to write data to another array without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: Specifically, the code writes to `fvalue[10]` without ensuring `fvalue` is large enough to accommodate that write. This write also manipulates the length of the field by setting `records[0]->fields[f+1]->len` to 10, even if the field has a different size.
- Improper bounds checking: The loop and index calculation logic within `mxit_parse_cmd_extprofile()` do not properly validate the 'count' value before using it as the upper bound for the loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: The out-of-bounds write can lead to memory corruption, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Pidgin process.
- Denial of service (DoS): The memory corruption can also cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability can also potentially be exploited for information disclosure, though this is not the main impact.
- File Overwrite: Although not explicitly mentioned in the Talos report, the Debian security advisory notes that the vulnerability could also be used to overwrite files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted MXit data via the server. This means the attacker doesn't need local access.
- The attacker must control the data sent by the MXit server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the data sent by the MXit server to a vulnerable Pidgin client. This likely involves compromising the MXit server, acting as a malicious MXit server, or intercepting and modifying the network traffic.

**Additional details:**
- The Talos report provides the specific code snippet within the vulnerable function, demonstrating the out-of-bounds write and the missing bounds check on the user-controlled input.
- Affected versions of Pidgin are specified across different distributions.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Yves Younan of Cisco Talos.

This is more detail than a generic CVE description, as the Talos report includes the vulnerable function and code snippets.
