```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "In the aacDecoder_drcExtractAndMap() function, the self->numThreads can be used after exceeding its maximum intended value, MAX_DRC_THREADS. This causes memory to be cleared after the threadBs[MAX_DRC_THREADS] array.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack corruption due to out-of-bounds access on the threadBs array.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption and potential crash. Could lead to remote code execution within the context of the mediaserver service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing of a specially crafted media file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious media file that triggers the vulnerable code path during media processing."
