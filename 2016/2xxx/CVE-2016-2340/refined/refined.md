Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Granite Data Services AMF framework failing to properly parse XML input containing a reference to external entities. This improper parsing allows for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is the presence of XXE injection in the AMF framework's XML parsing mechanism. This occurs when the XML parser doesn't properly handle external entities, allowing an attacker to define and load external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** A successful XXE attack could enable an attacker to read sensitive data residing on the vulnerable server. This may include files, configurations, or other confidential information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  XXE vulnerabilities can also be leveraged to cause a denial of service by forcing the server to process large or invalid external resources.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** In some cases, an attacker could potentially use XXE to perform server-side request forgery attacks, interacting with internal services or external endpoints on behalf of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted XML data to a server running a vulnerable version of Granite Data Services. This is a remote attack vector, meaning the attacker doesn't need to have physical access to the server.
- **AMF Framework:** The attack specifically targets the AMF framework of Granite Data Services, which is used for serializing data. The attacker manipulates the XML that is part of the AMF processing to inject the XXE payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable Granite Data Services instance.
- **Ability to Send Malicious XML:** The attacker needs to be able to transmit crafted XML to the server via the AMF framework.
- **Knowledge of the Target System:** While not strictly necessary, some knowledge of the target system's file structure and internal network could make the attack more impactful and targeted.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided github content is the source code repository for GraniteDS.
- The vulnerability specifically affects Granite Data Services version 3.1.1-SNAPSHOT.
- The CERT/CC vulnerability note indicates that there is currently no known practical solution, but it does link to more information regarding XXE vulnerabilities.
