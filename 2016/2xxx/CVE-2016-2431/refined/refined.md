- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm TrustZone component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a secure local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the TrustZone kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a local permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.
- **Attack vectors**: A local malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a secure local malicious application installed on the device.
