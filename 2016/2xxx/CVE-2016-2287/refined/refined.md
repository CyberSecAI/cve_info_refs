- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The XZERES 442SR turbine generator operating system (OS) does not provide adequate input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The lack of input validation allows the injection of malicious scripts into the program.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the injection of malicious scripts, potentially causing a loss of power for all attached systems and other impacts depending on the injected script.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the web-based interface system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not require authentication to perform the attack. The attacker must be able to send malicious script via the web-based interface.
