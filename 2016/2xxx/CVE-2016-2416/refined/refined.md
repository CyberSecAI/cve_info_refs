Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2416:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to an information disclosure in Mediaserver, specifically within the `BufferQueueConsumer::dump()` function. The root cause is a missing permission check before dumping the buffer queue content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** Lack of permission check allows unauthorized access to buffer queue contents. This exposes sensitive information that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Leakage:** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to access private information from the buffer queue.
-   **Bypass of Security Measures:** By leaking data, an attacker can bypass platform security measures that are meant to hinder exploit development. This vulnerability could be used to gain elevated privileges, as indicated in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Malicious Application:** A local application, without proper permissions, could trigger the `dump()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **No Elevated Permissions Required:** The attacker does not need any special permissions to exploit this flaw, as the permission check is missing in the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a permission check within `BufferQueueConsumer::dump()`.
-   The vulnerability is rated as High severity due to the possibility of gaining elevated privileges and bypassing security measures.
-   This issue affects multiple Android versions (4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1).
