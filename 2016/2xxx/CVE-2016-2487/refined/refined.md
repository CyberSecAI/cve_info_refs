Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing buffer size check in the mediaserver component, specifically when processing media files. The commit messages indicate a need to "check OMX buffer size before use", suggesting the vulnerability exists in how the mediaserver handles buffers related to OpenMAX (OMX), which is an API for multimedia processing. The affected decoders include avc, hevc and mpeg2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a missing or inadequate check on the size of buffers used in the decoding process. This can lead to a buffer overflow if a malicious media file provides a larger than expected buffer size, overwriting memory beyond the allocated buffer leading to corruption, and potentially code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary impact is the possibility of remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process. This process has access to sensitive audio and video streams and elevated system privileges. If an attacker can control the buffer overflow, they can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the mediaserver. This is a critical issue, leading to the possibility of remote device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Media Files:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious media files that trigger the buffer overflow when processed by mediaserver.
- **Multiple Delivery Methods:** These malicious files can be delivered via various means, including:
    - Email attachments
    - Web browsing (embedding the files in web pages)
    - MMS messages

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Delivery:** An attacker does not require physical access to the device. The exploit can be triggered remotely by sending the malicious media file via various methods mentioned above.
- **Crafted Media File:** An attacker needs the ability to create or manipulate media files to trigger the vulnerable code path in mediaserver and cause a buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple media codecs including, but not limited to, `avc, hevc, mpeg2, vorbis, opus, h263 and h264`.
- The fix involves implementing checks on the buffer sizes before they are used in the decoding process.
- This vulnerability is rated as High in severity as it is possible to gain elevated privileges and/or cause a denial of service.
- The provided content contains multiple AOSP commit links, showing the fixes for this issue across different media codecs.
