Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an Improper Authorization vulnerability. The application does not properly check if a user has authenticated before granting access to certain sensitive web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive parts of the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access, leading to:
- Disclosure of sensitive information (Confidentiality impact: Low)
- Modification of data or settings (Integrity impact: Low)

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, requiring network access to the vulnerable application. The attacker can directly access sensitive web pages without being authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable application, and no prior authentication is necessary. The attack complexity is low.

**Additional Details:**
