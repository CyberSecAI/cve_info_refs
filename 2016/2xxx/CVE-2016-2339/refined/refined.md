Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `Fiddle::Function.new` function within the Ruby programming language. Specifically, the "initialize" method of this function is vulnerable to a heap overflow.
- The `arg_types` buffer, intended to store argument types, is allocated based on the initial length of the `args` array provided to the function.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `to_int` method is called on an element in the `args` array, if the element is not already an Integer. This method is called by `NUM2INT`.
- A specially crafted object, with a malicious `to_int` method, can increase the size of the `args` array *after* the `arg_types` buffer has been allocated, but before the loop finishes iterating through the initial `args` array. This results in a heap buffer overflow when the code attempts to write into the `arg_types` buffer beyond its allocated size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `arg_types` buffer.
- **Unsafe Object Handling:** The code doesn't properly handle objects with custom `to_int` methods, allowing an attacker to manipulate the size of the `args` array during processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow can be leveraged to overwrite adjacent memory regions on the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The provided crash analysis shows memory corruption.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if full code execution is not achieved, the overflow can lead to a crash of the Ruby interpreter, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must provide a specially crafted Ruby object that has a `to_int` method, within the `args` array passed to `Fiddle::Function.new`.
- This object must be designed such that when `to_int` method is invoked, it increases the size of the `args` array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `Fiddle::Function.new` method.
- This could occur if an application accepts external inputs and uses them to construct the arguments for a `Fiddle::Function` object.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide custom Ruby objects as arguments.
- The attacker does not need local access to the server, as it can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the heap overflow by creating a `MyObject` class with a `to_int` method that increases the size of the `$args` array.
- The crash analysis shows the heap corruption occurring and crashing the Ruby process.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, elaborating on the vulnerable function, the specific manipulation possible via the `to_int` method, and the memory corruption involved.
