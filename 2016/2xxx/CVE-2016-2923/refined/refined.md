- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the failure to set the `HTTPOnly` flag for cookies when using the JAX-RS API in IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the absence of the `HTTPOnly` flag on cookies. This allows client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) to access the cookie data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the cookie. This could potentially include session identifiers, authentication tokens, or other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, exploiting the lack of the `HTTPOnly` flag by using client-side scripting to access the cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute client-side scripting on the victim's browser when the user accesses the application.
