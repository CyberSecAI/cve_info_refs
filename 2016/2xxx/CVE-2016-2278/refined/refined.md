Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user input within the restricted shell (msh) of Schneider Electric's StruxureWare Building Operation Automation Server. Specifically, administrative users can append shell commands to legitimate `msh` commands, leading to execution of arbitrary OS commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands. This is achieved by appending `| <command>` to any of the available `msh` commands.
*   **Weak Default Credentials:** The default 'admin' user has a default password of 'admin,' which is a significant security flaw. Also, the default root account has no password set. The system does not enforce password changes upon initial use, which is fixed in later versions.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** It is possible to escalate privileges to root using the `sudo -i` command, as the root user has no password set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation of the OS Command Injection allows an attacker to gain full (indirect) control over the server by running arbitrary system commands.
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can read sensitive information such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can gain root-level access to the system using `sudo -i` due to the missing root password.
*   **Circumvention of Access Controls:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended restrictions of the `msh` shell and the access controls of the Linux OS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker via SSH by logging in as the 'admin' user using default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Automation Server.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log in, such as the default 'admin' user with the password 'admin'.
*   **Basic Skills:** The exploit can be executed by an attacker with low skills. They need to know to append shell commands to the `msh` commands using the pipe character (`|`).

**Additional Details**

*   The vendor released an updated firmware version to address the issue by preventing the use of default credentials and blocking command injection.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions 1.7 and prior of the Automation Server.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by an independent researcher, Karn Ganeshen.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.2, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The vendor, Schneider Electric, is located in Paris, France and has offices in over 100 countries worldwide.
