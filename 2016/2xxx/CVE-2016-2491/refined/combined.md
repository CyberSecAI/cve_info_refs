# Android Security Bulletin—June 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published June 06, 2016 | Updated June 08, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Nexus
firmware images have also been released to the
[Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images).
Security Patch Levels of June 01, 2016 or later address these issues. Refer
to the [Nexus documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices) to learn how to check the security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on May 02,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have
been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe issue is a Critical security vulnerability that could enable
remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such as
email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google Service Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as
SafetyNet, which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Android and Google Service Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet.
These capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could
be successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
    [Verify Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
    [Potentially Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default
    on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms),
    and is especially important for users who install applications from outside
    of Google Play. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but
    Verify Apps warns users when they attempt to install a detected rooting
    application—no matter where it comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts
    to identify and block installation of known malicious applications that exploit
    a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an application has already been
    installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected
    application.* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
      pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security Patch Levels of June 01, 2016 or later address these issues (refer to
the [Nexus documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705)
for instructions on how to check the security patch level). Device
manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string level to:
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-06-01]

**2. How do I determine which Nexus devices are affected by each issue?**

In the [Security Vulnerability Details](#security_vulnerability_summary) section,
each table has an Updated Nexus devices column that covers the range
of affected Nexus devices updated for each issue. This column has a few
options:

* **All Nexus devices**: If an issue affects all Nexus devices, the table
  will have “All Nexus” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column. “All Nexus”
  encapsulates the following [supported devices](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013),
  Nexus 9, Android One, Nexus Player, and Pixel C.
* **Some Nexus devices**: If an issue doesn’t affect all Nexus devices,
  the affected Nexus devices are listed in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
* **No Nexus devices**: If no Nexus devices are affected by the issue,
  the table will have “None” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
