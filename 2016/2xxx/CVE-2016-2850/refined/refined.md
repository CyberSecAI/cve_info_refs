Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly enforce TLS policy within the Botan library. Specifically, during TLS v1.2 negotiation, the library did not verify that the received signature algorithms and hash functions matched the specified policy. This also affected client certificate authentication. Additionally, the TLS client did not verify that the server's chosen ECC curve was acceptable based on the client's policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TLS Policy Enforcement Failure:** The primary weakness is the lack of enforcement of the negotiated TLS policy, specifically signature algorithms, hash functions and ECC curves.
- **Signature Algorithm/Hash Function Bypass:** Allows a server to use weaker cryptographic algorithms (like MD5 or SHA-1) for signatures than what the client's policy would otherwise allow.
- **ECC curve policy bypass:** Allows a server to select an ECC curve that is not allowed by the client policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing TLS Security:** An attacker could potentially force the use of weaker, less secure cryptographic algorithms. In a TLS handshake, a server could present certificates signed using MD5 or SHA1, which are considered insecure and should be disallowed by the policy.
- **Compromised TLS/SSL connections:** By using less secure signature algorithms, an attacker can weaken the security of the TLS connection, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.
- **Client cert bypass:** The vulnerability in the client cert authentication could lead to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned in the middle of a client-server TLS connection could exploit this to negotiate a weaker signature algorithm from the server.
- **Malicious Server:** A malicious server could take advantage of this vulnerability to offer weaker security than the client might expect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or influence the TLS handshake process, either as a MitM attacker or by controlling the server.
- **Knowledge of TLS Negotiation:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how TLS negotiation works to exploit this vulnerability.
