- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Fonality software (previously trixbox Pro) uses a hard-coded password for FTP access to sync phone configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of a hard-coded password (CWE-259).
    - The default SSH server configuration allows the FTP user to log in via SSH and obtain a shell as the 'nobody' user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded password can log into the server as the 'nobody' user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to know the hard-coded password and use FTP or SSH.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and knowledge of the hard-coded password.
