Original Release Date: 2016-06-01 | Last Revised: 2016-12-21

---

### Overview

Fonality (previously trixbox Pro) version 12.6 and later uses a hard-coded password, and the accompanying HUDweb plugin embeds a private SSL key.

### Description

| [**CWE-259**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Password -** CVE-2016-2362  According to the reporter, FTP is used to sync phone configurations for users, by use of a hard-coded username and password. The default SSH server configuration allows the FTP user to also log in via SSH and obtain a shell as the 'nobody' user.[**CWE-266**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/266.html)**: Incorrect Privilege Assignment -** CVE-2016-2363According to the reporter, the script /var/www/rpc/surun has incorrect permissions, allowing the user 'nobody' to run many commands as root.[**CWE-321**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key -** CVE-2016-2364According to the reporter, the HUDweb plugin for Google Chrome contains a Thawte-signed SSL certificate and private key. This key is shared across all installations.The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-2363. |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with knowledge of the password may be able to log into the server as 'nobody' and execute commands as root. An attacker with knowledge of the private key may be able to conduct impersonation, man-in-the-middle, or passive decryption attacks. |
