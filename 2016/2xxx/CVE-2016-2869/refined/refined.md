Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in various fields of the QRadar UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The QRadar UI is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to insufficient input sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the QRadar UI. This could lead to:
    * Stealing user session cookies.
    * Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * Performing unauthorized actions within the QRadar application on behalf of the victim.
    * Defacement of the QRadar UI.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable fields within the QRadar UI. This can be achieved by crafting specific inputs that are not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An attacker would require the ability to provide input to the vulnerable fields in the QRadar UI, which often means they would need some level of access to the application's interface.
* An attacker may need to craft a specific payload to exploit the XSS vulnerability effectively, including encoding and placement.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided document does not specify the exact vulnerable fields but specifies that the XSS vulnerability was present in various fields.
*  The issue affects IBM QRadar 7.2.n and 7.1.n versions.
*  Fixes are available in QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF 7.2.7 and IBM QRadar SIEM 7.1 MR2 Patch 13.
* There are no workarounds or mitigations available other than patching the affected systems.
