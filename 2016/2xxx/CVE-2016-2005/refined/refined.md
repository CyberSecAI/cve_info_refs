- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `OmniInet.exe` process of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Protector when parsing a malformed user name field in an `EXEC_BAR` request. The process blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted `EXEC_BAR` request with a malformed user name field to the vulnerable service (`OmniInet.exe`) listening on TCP port 5555.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
