Subject: CVE request Qemu: usb: ehci null pointer dereference in
 ehci_caps_write

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the USB EHCI emulation support is vulnerable to a
null pointer dereference flaw. It could occur when an application attempts to
write to EHCI capabilities registers.

A privileged user inside quest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
instance resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-01/msg05899.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1301643>

This issue was discovered by Mr Zuozhi Fzz of Alibaba Inc.

Thank you.

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

USB Ehci emulation supports host controller capability registers.
But its mmio '.write' function was missing, which lead to a null
pointer dereference issue. Add a do nothing 'ehci_caps_write'
definition to avoid it; Do nothing because capability registers
are Read Only(RO).

# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201604-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.0-r2** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Local users within a guest QEMU environment can execute arbitrary code
within the host or a cause a Denial of Service condition of the QEMU
guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.5.0-r2"

```
