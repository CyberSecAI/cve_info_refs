  "CVE-2016-2810": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 46.0 on Android before 5.0 allows attackers to bypass intended Signature access requirements via a crafted application that leverages content-provider permissions, as demonstrated by reading the browser history or a saved password.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Firefox on Android allowing malicious applications to bypass signature protections and access sensitive data by defining permissions with the same names as Firefox's content providers, exploiting a limitation in how Android handles custom permissions in versions below 5.0.",
         "weaknesses": [
          "Improper permission handling",
          "Bypass of signature protections",
          "Inadequate restriction of access to sensitive data"
        ],
        "impact": "A malicious application, installed beforehand, could potentially access sensitive information like browsing history and saved passwords from Firefox for Android.",
        "attack_vectors": [
           "A crafted android application installed on the same device as the vulnerable Firefox browser."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to install a crafted application on the victim's Android device with an Android version below 5.0. The malicious application also needs to define specific permissions that are the same as those used by Firefox's content providers to access sensitive user data"
      }
    ],
    "affected_products": [
       "Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 46.0 on Android versions prior to 5.0"
