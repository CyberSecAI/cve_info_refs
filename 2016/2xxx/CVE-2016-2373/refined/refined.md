Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the Pidgin MXit protocol plugin. Specifically, when parsing a contact update packet, the `mxit_parse_cmd_contact` function extracts the contact's mood from data received from the server. This mood value, after being converted to an integer, is used as an index into the `mxit_moods` array. However, the code does not properly validate this index, allowing an attacker to provide a mood value that results in an out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `mxit_moods` array using an attacker-controlled index.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The code fails to validate the 'mood' value received from the server before using it as an array index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash of the Pidgin application, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly stated as the primary impact, an out-of-bounds read *could* potentially lead to information disclosure if the accessed memory contains sensitive data.
*   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** The provided information mentions that a remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code but only in the context of other vulnerabilities in pidgin. The Talos report specifically states that this vulnerability results in a denial of service by an out of bounds read. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted MXit data via a malicious server or by acting as a malicious user sending invalid mood information in a contact update packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a Pidgin client using the MXit protocol. This could be achieved by setting up a malicious server or by controlling an MXit account that interacts with the target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of Pidgin prior to 2.11.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Yves Younan of Cisco Talos.
*   The CVSSv3 score is 5.9, indicating a medium severity.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
