# Security Bulletin: IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the Command Line Interface (CLI) that may affect system availability. (CVE-2016-2870)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the Command Line Interface (CLI) that may affect system availability.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2870](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2870) IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the Command Line Interface (CLI) that may affect system availability.

CVSS Base Score: 2.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112800> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

## Affected Products and Versions

WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1

WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.5

## Remediation/Fixes

Apply an interim fix, according to the table below.Interim fixes are associated with the original APAR that is documented in the table. Because these APAR references might be updated to more recent APARs, see the links in the table for the most recent interim fix information.

This interim fix contains a new default SSL certificate, as the previous default SSL certificate, which was never intended for production use, has an MD5 signature and is no longer compatible with Java. For deployments that have not installed XC10 interim fixes since February 26, 2016, the following applies: installing this interim fix will make it incompatible with any WebSphere Datapower XC10 appliances that are running with an MD5 certificate, including the default SSL certificate that was shipped prior to this interim fix. If the appliance is configured with a custom keystore and certificate with an MD5 signature, it must be replaced prior to upgrading to this interim fix or the 'clear-tls-config' command must be run on the appliance before or after performing the upgrade. Failing to do so will result in the appliance failing to start. Note that changing the active certificate for an appliance collective does require that the cache be reloaded and client truststores must be configured to trust the new certificate.
