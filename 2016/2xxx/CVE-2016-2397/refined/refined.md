- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data. The `cliserver` implementation accepts, deserializes, and executes XML-encoded, serialized Java code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe deserialization of XML-encoded, serialized Java code without proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Dell SonicWALL GMS Virtual Appliance installations with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack, no authentication is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required, so the attacker does not need prior access.
