Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2337:

**Root Cause:**
- Type confusion vulnerability in the `_cancel_eval` method of Ruby's `TclTkIp` class.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- The `_cancel_eval` method expects a string as the `retval` argument. However, it doesn't perform type checking, allowing an attacker to pass an object of a different type.
- Inside the `ip_cancel_eval_core` function, this unchecked `msg` argument is used as a string to create a `Tcl_Obj` using `Tcl_NewStringObj(RSTRING_PTR(msg), RSTRING_LEN(msg))`. Passing a non-string object results in type confusion, as `RSTRING_PTR` and `RSTRING_LEN` expect a string object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution can occur due to the type confusion vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a non-string object as the `retval` argument to the `_cancel_eval` method.
- This is done directly by calling the `_cancel_eval` method of an instance of the `TclTkIp` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute Ruby code that interacts with the TclTkIp class.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Ruby versions 2.3.0 dev and 2.2.2 and with Tcl/Tk 8.6 or later.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by passing an integer to `_cancel_eval`.
- The Gentoo security advisory indicates that this vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The Debian security advisory explicitly states that "Attacker passing different type of object than String as `retval` argument can cause arbitrary code execution."
