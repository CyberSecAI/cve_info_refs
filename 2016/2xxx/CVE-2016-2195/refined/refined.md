Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2016-2195:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `PointGFp` constructor in the Botan library did not validate that the affine coordinate arguments were less than the prime number. During curve multiplication, it assumed that the multiplication of these arguments would fit within an integer twice the size of the prime.
- Additionally, the `bigint_mul` and `bigint_sqr` functions received the output buffer size but only used it for optimization purposes, selecting a faster unrolled multiplication algorithm when there was sufficient output space, not for proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow: Due to the lack of input validation and incorrect size handling in multiplication functions, a heap overflow occurs when processing attacker-controlled ECC point data.
- Lack of proper bounds checking in the point constructor and multiplication functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: The vulnerability can likely be exploited for remote code execution due to the heap overflow.
- Potential overwriting of adjacent key material: On systems using the `mlock` pool allocator, the overflow can overwrite memory held in secure vector objects, potentially exposing sensitive key material. Although directly overwriting to code execution is limited by guard pages, adjacent key material could be compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during ECC point decoding which processes untrusted inputs.
- An attacker can supply malicious affine coordinate arguments during ECC point decompression to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted inputs to a system using the vulnerable Botan library's ECC point decoding functionality.
-  The attacker does not need local access to the server and can likely exploit this vulnerability remotely.
