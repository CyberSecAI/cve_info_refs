{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the protocol specified in the URL when uploading a file via the SOAP API. The `importFileByInternalUserId` or `importFile` methods in the `FileService` uses Java's URL class without checking what protocol handler is specified in the API call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Arbitrary File Read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "SOAP API calls to `importFileByInternalUserId`",
      "SOAP API calls to `importFile`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to call the affected SOAP API methods."
