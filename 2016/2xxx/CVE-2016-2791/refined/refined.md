Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-2791:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content is related to the specified CVE based on mentions in security advisories from openSUSE and SUSE, Mozilla Security Advisory, Ubuntu Security Notice, and bug reports from bugzilla.mozilla.org, all specifically referencing CVE-2016-2791 along with other related CVEs.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `graphite2::GlyphCache::glyph` function in the Graphite 2 library. Specifically, there's a heap-buffer-overflow read due to a flaw in handling crafted Graphite smart fonts. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Heap-buffer-overflow read vulnerability.
    *   Improper handling of malicious graphite fonts within the `graphite2::GlyphCache::glyph` function
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of service:**  A remote attacker can trigger a buffer over-read which can lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While primarily described as a denial-of-service vulnerability, the possibility of unspecified, other impacts including arbitrary code execution, is also mentioned.
    *   The Suse information says "A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or obtain sensitive information".
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through network requests.
    *   **Crafted Font File:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted Graphite smart font. This can be delivered through websites visited by the user, or via malicious attachments.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote attacker:** The attacker does not need to be locally present to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **User Interaction:** The victim must interact by opening/processing a webpage, email, or other documents containing the crafted font or be tricked into browsing a malicious website. The CVSS v3 score specifies that user interaction is required.

**3. Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `graphite2::GlyphCache::glyph` function.
*   The issue was addressed in Graphite 2 version 1.3.6.
*   Mozilla Firefox before 45.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.7 were affected.
*   Thunderbird was also affected.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during fuzzing.
*   Several advisories and bug reports tie this CVE with a group of Graphite 2 vulnerabilities, highlighting that this is not an isolated issue.
