- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of server certificates in SSL/TLS communications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly validate server certificates during SSL/TLS communication, allowing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could perform man-in-the-middle attacks by intercepting and potentially modifying communication between the affected components and the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting SSL/TLS communication between the affected ClearQuest components and the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the affected ClearQuest components and the server.
