Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the libstagefright library due to issues with handling CENC (Common Encryption) offsets and the sizes table. This occurs during the parsing of sample encryption information when playing certain types of media content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `stagefright::SampleTable::parseSampleCencInfo` function, specifically when handling CENC offsets and size data within the libstagefright library. This allows for writing beyond the intended memory boundary, leading to potential code execution or DoS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox or Thunderbird.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation can lead to an application crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted web site:** The vulnerability can be triggered by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website.
- **Media content with crafted CENC offsets:** The specific trigger is malformed media content that contains manipulated CENC offsets and sizes data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Ability to create malicious media or websites:** An attacker needs to create specially crafted malicious web pages or media content to trigger the vulnerability in the affected software.
- **User interaction needed:** Requires user to open the crafted website or media content.

**Additional Information from Analyzed Content:**
- **Mozilla:** Mozilla identified the vulnerability (MFSA 2016-44), and it affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, and potentially other Mozilla-based products. They acknowledge Sascha Just as the reporter of the vulnerability.
- **Red Hat:** Red Hat's security advisory (RHSA-2016:0695) also mentions this vulnerability and provides updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. They also acknowledge Sascha Just as the reporter. Red Hat considers this vulnerability to have a "Critical" security impact.
- **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-2936-1) includes this vulnerability, along with other Firefox issues, and they state that an attacker could cause DoS or execute arbitrary code via a crafted website.
- **SUSE:** SUSE's CVE entry for CVE-2016-2814 lists the vulnerability as "moderate" severity, noting that it's a heap-based buffer overflow in libstagefright triggered by crafted CENC offsets. They indicate the fix is included in multiple SUSE Linux Enterprise versions and OpenSUSE.
- **Oracle:**  Oracle Linux bulletin mentions this CVE and states that it can be exploited remotely without authentication.
- **Gentoo:** Gentoo's security advisory (GLSA 201701-15) states the vulnerability affects Firefox and Thunderbird.
- **Bugzilla:** The bugzilla entries from both Mozilla and SUSE provide more technical details around the issue, its resolution and which versions were affected. The fixes involve ensuring consistency in CENC offsets and sizes within `SampleTable::parseSampleCencInfo`.

In summary, CVE-2016-2814 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability affecting Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird and other related products due to an issue in the parsing of sample encryption data within libstagefright. It allows a remote attacker to potentially execute code or cause a denial-of-service through specially crafted content.
