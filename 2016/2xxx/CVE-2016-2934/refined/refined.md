Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within IBM BigFix Remote Control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application's output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows attackers to embed malicious JavaScript code.
- Successful exploitation could lead to various attacks, such as:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing sensitive information.
    - Defacing the web application.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the IBM BigFix Remote Control application through user-supplied input. The specific input vector isn't detailed, but it's likely through a field or parameter that the application does not adequately validate or sanitize.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply malicious input to the vulnerable application. This implies that the attacker likely needs to be a user of the system, or have the ability to inject the input through other means.
- The attacker does not need local access to the server, they can exploit remotely via network access to the BigFix Remote Control web application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects the server component of IBM BigFix Remote Control.
- The vulnerability was addressed in IBM BigFix Remote Control 9.1.3 application update.
- The provided information is more detailed than the initial CVE description which was a PLACEHOLDER.
