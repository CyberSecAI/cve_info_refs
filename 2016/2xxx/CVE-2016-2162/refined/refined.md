- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `I18NInterceptor` in Apache Struts does not validate user input, accepting arbitrary strings that could be used to display the user-selected language. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input validation in `I18NInterceptor`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the user's browser, leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious strings through the `Locale` object. The application then uses this string to display the user-selected language, leading to the execution of injected code in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control the input provided to the `Locale` object. The attacker's position would need to be such that they can influence the language selection mechanism.
