*Moxa MiiNePort - Multiple Vulnerabilities*

Multiple vulnerabilities are present in Moxa MiiNePort. Following versions
have been verified, but it is highly probable all other versions are
affected as well.

*About*

Moxa provides a full spectrum of quality products for industrial
networking, computing, and automation, and maintains a distribution and
service network that reaches customers in more than 70 countries. Our
products have connected over 30 million devices worldwide in a wide range
of applications, including factory automation, smart rail, smart grid,
intelligent transportation, oil & gas, marine, and mining. By continually
improving staff expertise in a variety of technologies and markets, we aim
to be the first choice for industrial automation solutions.

Moxa's embedded serial-to-Ethernet device server modules are small, consume
less power, and integration is easy.

The embedded serial-to-Ethernet device servers modules consist of the
MiiNePort serial device server series and the NE device server module
series.

Moxa’s MiiNePort E3 series embedded device servers are designed for
manufacturers who want to add sophisticated network connectivity to their
serial devices with minimal integration effort. The MiiNePort E3 is
empowered by the MiiNe, Moxa’s second generation SoC, which supports 10/100
Mbps Ethernet, up to 921.6 kbps serial baudrate, a versatile selection of
ready-to-use operation modes, and requires only a small amount of power. By
using Moxa’s innovative NetEZ technology, the MiiNePort E3 can be used to
convert any device with a standard serial interface to an Ethernet enabled
device in no time. In addition, the MiiNePort E3 is a compact embedded
device server with an RJ45 connector, making it easy to fit into virtually
any existing serial device.

*Confirmed Device Models + Firmware versions*
Device name MiiNePort_E1_7080
Firmware version 1.1.10 Build 09120714

Device name MiiNePort_E1_4641
Firmware version 1.1.10 Build 09120714

Device name MiiNePort_E2_1242
Firmware version 1.1 Build 10080614

Device name : MiiNePort_E2_4561
Firmware version : 1.1 Build 10080614

Model name MiiNePort E3
Firmware version 1.0 Build 11071409

*Vulnerability Summary*

1. Weak Credentials Management - CVE-2016-2286

2. Sensitive information not protected - CVE-2016-2295

3. Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery - CVE-2016-2285

*Vulnerability Description*

1. *Weak Credentials Management*

By default, no password is set on the device / application. The device /
application does not enforce a mandatory password change mechanism, forcing
users to a) set/change the password on first login, b) ensure the password
meets complexity requirements, and c) change password periodically.

This allows anyone to access the device over HTTP and Telnet. Access to the
device provides full administrative functionality.

2. *Sensitive information not protected*

Information such as Connect passwords, SNMP community strings is not
protected and shown in clear-text when viewing and / or downloaded device
config (HTTP / Telnet).

3. Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery

There is no CSRF Token generated per page and / or per (sensitive)
function. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows silent
execution of unauthorized actions on the device such as password change,
configuration parameter changes, saving modified configuration, & device
reboot.

ICS Advisory
# Moxa MiiNePort Vulnerabilities (Update A)

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-145-01A

## OVERVIEW

This updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-16-145-01 Moxa MiiNePort Vulnerabilities that was published May 24, 2016, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site.

Independent researcher Karn Ganeshen has identified weak credential management, sensitive information not protected, and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities in Moxa’s MiiNePort serial device server module series. Moxa will produce a beta patch firmware in late May 2016 to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following MiiNePort versions are affected:

* MiiNePort\_E1\_7080 Firmware Version 1.1.10 Build 09120714,
* MiiNePort\_E1\_4641 Firmware Version 1.1.10 Build 09120714,
* MiiNePort\_E2\_1242 Firmware Version 1.1 Build 10080614,
* MiiNePort\_E2\_4561 Firmware Version 1.1 Build 10080614, and
* MiiNePort E3 Firmware Version 1.0 Build 11071409

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allow silent execution of unauthorized actions on the device such as password change, configuration parameter changes, saving modified configuration, and device reboot.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Moxa is a Taiwan-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world, including the US, the UK, India, Germany, France, China, Russia, and Brazil.

The affected product, MiiNePort, is a serial device server module. According to Moxa, MiiNePort is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems. Moxa estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Moxa recommends disabling Ports TCP/80 (HTTP) and TCP/23 (TELNET). Moxa indicates that users should ensure that Ports UDP/161 (SNMP), UDP/4800 (utility), and TCP/4900 (utility) are only accessible by trusted systems and that restricting access to Ports UDP/4800 and TCP/4900 will impact remote systems administration.

Ensure the passwords have been enabled.

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
