  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-2046",
    "description": "A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Sophos UTM 9.350-12 with pattern version 92405 that allows attackers to craft a hyperlink that contains a reflected XSS payload via the ‘lang’ parameter. If visited by the targeted user, the XSS payload gets stored in a local cookie variable which is re-executed whenever the UserPortal landing page is visited. By not properly sanitizing the language selection parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary Javascript or modify page contents by injecting remote HTML content. This does not require that the user be authenticated to the application.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the 'lang' parameter in the Sophos UTM 9 user portal. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, data theft, or other malicious activities. The injected code persists via a cookie, affecting all subsequent visits to the UserPortal landing page until the cookie is cleared.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted hyperlink that includes the malicious payload within the 'lang' parameter. The attacker would need to distribute this link to the victim.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and to get the victim to click on them."
