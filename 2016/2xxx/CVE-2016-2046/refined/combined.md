## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

# CVE-2016-2046 Cross Site Scripting in Sophos UTM 9

---

*From*: Mike Lisi <mike.codes.things () gmail com>

*Date*: Mon, 8 Feb 2016 09:51:03 -0500

```
-----------
Vendor:
-----------
Sophos (<https://www.sophos.com>)

-----------------------------------------
Affected Products/Versions:
-----------------------------------------
Product: Sophos UTM 9
Version: 9.350-12 with pattern version 92405 (potentially lower)

----------------
Description:
----------------
Title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Sophos UTM 9
CVE: CVE-2016-2046
Researcher: Mike Lisi - HALOCK Security Labs (@MikeHacksThings)

A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Sophos UTM 9.350-12 with pattern version 92405 that allows attackers to
craft a hyperlink that contains a reflected XSS payload via the ‘lang’ parameter. If visited by the targeted user, the
XSS payload gets stored in a local cookie variable which is re-executed whenever the UserPortal landing page is
visited. By not properly sanitizing the language selection parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary Javascript or
modify page contents by injecting remote HTML content. This does not require that the user be authenticated to the
application.

Typically this would all be considered Reflected XSS, however, once one of the PoC links is visited by the targeted
user, the data passed via the ‘lang’ parameter is stored in a local cookie file named ‘eup_force_lang’ on the user’s
machine. Once the cookie is set, the user no longer needs to visit the malicious crafted links discussed before. The
cookie data is injected into the page automatically. This persists until the cookie is cleared from the browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------
POC - Authentication not required:
-------------------------------------------------------------
<https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/?lang=english”;alert>(‘xss’);//

-------------
Solution:
-------------
UTM 9.353 was officially announced and released on January 28, 2016 which includes a fix to address this vulnerability.

# CVE-2016-2046 – CROSS SITE SCRIPTING IN SOPHOS UTM 9

**Title:** CVE-2016-2046 – CROSS SITE SCRIPTING IN SOPHOS UTM 9
**Product:** Sophos UTM 9
**Vendor:** Sophos

**Version:** 9.350-12 with pattern version 92405 (potentially lower)

**Vendor Notified Date:** December 14, 2015

**Vendor Resolved Date:** December 18, 2015

**Release Date:** January 28, 2016

**Risk:** Medium

**Authentication:** Not Required

**Remote:** Yes

**Description:**

A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Sophos UTM 9.350-12 with pattern version 92405 that allows attackers to craft a hyperlink that contains a reflected XSS payload via the ‘lang’ parameter. If visited by the targeted user, the XSS payload gets stored in a local cookie variable which is re-executed whenever the UserPortal landing page is visited. By not properly sanitizing the language selection parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary Javascript or modify page contents by injecting remote HTML content. This does not require that the user be authenticated to the application.

**Exploit steps for proof-of-concept:**

1. The Sophos authentication page has a drop-down option to switch the language. When clicking the drop-down menu and selecting a language, the selection is passed back to the same page using the ‘lang’ URL parameter, which is not properly sanitized. It’s possible to inject malicious payloads into the language option to perform cross-site scripting. The payloads require slight modification to properly escape the vulnerable Javascript code block.
2. The relevant Javascript code block with the XSS payload is: https://vulnerablehost.com/?lang=english”;alert(‘xss’);//
3. A pop-up box is displayed as a result of the payload being executed.
4. Reproduction URL: https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/?lang=english”;alert(‘xss’);//
5. This injection isn’t limited to just Javascript payloads. The

Your md5 value in the article is wrong.

When you check the md5 sum from the file location, it is correctly displayed as

which also fits the file linked in the article.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
