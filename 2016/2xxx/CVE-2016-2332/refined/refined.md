Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-2332

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, specifically command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The device's web interface, running as the root user, is vulnerable to command injection. This occurs via an authenticated POST request to `flu.cgi`, specifically through the "5066" (dnsmasq) parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system as the root user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Network-Based Attack:** The attack is performed remotely over a network via the web interface.
*   **Authenticated POST Request:**  The attacker needs to send an authenticated POST request to `flu.cgi` and include a malicious payload in the vulnerable parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the web interface to exploit the command injection vulnerability.
