Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the PL/SQL Developer software performing updates over HTTP without proper verification of the update's authenticity. This lack of verification allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept the update process and inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345):** The software downloads and executes updates without verifying their integrity or origin. This is the primary vulnerability.
*   **Use of HTTP:** The software uses unencrypted HTTP for update checks and downloads, making it susceptible to interception and tampering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PL/SQL Developer user. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify data on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker must be positioned on the network between the victim and the update server. This is typically done by intercepting network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the update server.
*   **MitM Position:** The attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in PL/SQL Developer version 11.
*   The vendor was notified and released a fix in version 11.0.6, which uses HTTPS and restricts downloads to the allroundautomations.com domain.
*   The original report of this vulnerability was from Adam Caudill, who also published a blog post with more details.
*   The provided content also discusses another issue regarding password storage within the application which is not directly related to CVE-2016-2346, but was discovered during the same research process. This is a separate issue involving a weak proprietary encryption method for passwords.
