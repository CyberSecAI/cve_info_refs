Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw in the IBM QRadar SIEM UI. This means the application processes user-supplied XML without properly sanitizing or validating it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject external entity references into XML data. By crafting malicious XML, an attacker can potentially make the server access arbitrary local or remote files.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The QRadar UI does not validate uploaded XML, allowing malicious XML content to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with privileges to upload XML can potentially perform actions such as:
    *   **Reading arbitrary files on the server:** By referencing files via external entities, an attacker could read sensitive files accessible to the QRadar application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XML Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the QRadar UI, where an attacker uploads maliciously crafted XML files.
*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of privileges that allow uploading the XML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the QRadar SIEM and have upload permissions within the application.
*   **Knowledge of XXE:** The attacker needs to have a certain understanding of XML and the XXE vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
