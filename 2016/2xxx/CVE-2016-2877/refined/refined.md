Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2877:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect permission assignment for a security-critical resource within IBM QRadar SIEM. This means that the software grants permissions in a way that allows unintended actors to read or modify the resource.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Permission Assignment:** The core issue is that the software does not properly restrict access to a sensitive resource. This leads to an authorization bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access/Modification:** An attacker who exploits this vulnerability could read or modify the security-critical resource, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches
    - System manipulation
    - Compromise of the SIEM's security posture

**Attack vectors:**
The description does not specify the exact method of exploitation or attack vectors, but the vulnerability likely involves exploiting the incorrect permissions to gain unauthorized access to the resource.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The content does not explicitly state the attacker's capabilities or position, but it would require the attacker to have some level of access to the vulnerable system or network where IBM QRadar SIEM is running. The attacker would also need some understanding of how the resource and its permissions work in order to exploit the flaw.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM QRadar versions 7.2.n and 7.1.n
- The vulnerability is resolved in:
  - QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF 7.2.7
  - IBM QRadar SIEM 7.1 MR2 Patch 13
- No workarounds or mitigations are mentioned.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the IBM X-Force Ethical Hacking Team.
