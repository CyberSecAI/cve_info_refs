Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-2542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Untrusted Search Path" issue within Flexera InstallShield.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426):** The application does not properly validate the paths from which it loads DLL files, allowing an attacker to control the DLL that is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute malicious code (a Trojan horse DLL).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By controlling the loaded DLL, an attacker can gain elevated privileges on the system, as the setup-launcher executable likely runs with higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** This vulnerability is exploitable locally. An attacker needs to have a foothold on the target system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering tactics to persuade the victim to place the malicious DLL in the working directory of a setup-launcher executable file, and execute the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the target system.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a specific directory.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to execute the setup-launcher.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Flexera InstallShield through version 2015 SP1.
*   Many products from other companies integrate Flexera InstallShield, making them susceptible to this flaw.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 7.3.
*   Exploitation requires a user to be tricked into running an installer with a crafted working directory.
*   No known public exploits are specifically targeting this vulnerability.
*   The advisory from US-CERT recommends caution against social engineering tactics, which is required for this attack.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in Flexera InstallShield allows a local attacker to escalate privileges by getting a user to execute a setup-launcher executable, that then loads an attacker-controlled DLL from the current working directory.
