Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2521:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to DLL hijacking. Wireshark loads DLLs based on the location of capture files being analyzed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Wireshark does not properly validate the location of DLLs that it loads, which makes it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By placing a specially crafted DLL in the same directory as a capture file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code when Wireshark is used to open the file. This could lead to complete compromise of the user's system, data breaches or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as a capture file.
- The victim needs to open the capture file using a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write files in a directory where a user might place a capture file.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious DLL that would be executed by Wireshark.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious or a legitimate capture file placed in the same directory as the malicious DLL.
