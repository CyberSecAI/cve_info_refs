Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2142:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` configuration file in OpenShift, which could contain Active Directory credentials, was world-readable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure file permissions: The configuration file containing sensitive information was accessible to all local users.
- Storage of sensitive data in plaintext: Active Directory bind passwords were stored in the configuration file, potentially in plaintext.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to Active Directory credentials: A local user could read the `master-config.yaml` file and obtain the Active Directory bind password.
- Potential for further unauthorized access: The compromised credentials could be used to gain further access to Active Directory resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: A local user with access to the OpenShift system could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the OpenShift system where the vulnerable `master-config.yaml` file resides.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.
- Red Hat provided a security update (RHSA-2016:1038) to address the issue.
- The fix involves a backported patch to correct the file permissions.
- It is recommended to reset the Active Directory password after installing the update if there is a suspicion the password has been viewed.
