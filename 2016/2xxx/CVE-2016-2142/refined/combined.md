## Synopsis

Moderate: openshift security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1038)

## Topic

Updated openshift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or
private cloud deployments.

An access flaw was discovered in OpenShift; the
/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml configuration file, which could
contain Active Directory credentials, was world-readable. A local user
could exploit this flaw to obtain authentication credentials from the
master-config.yaml file. (CVE-2016-2142)

If you believe that the password in this file has been viewed by an
attacker you should reset the password after installing this update.

All installations with Active Directory integration are advised to upgrade
to the updated software, which contains a backported patch to correct this
issue.

This update includes the following images:

openshift3/ose:v3.1.1.6-19
openshift3/ose-deployer:v3.1.1.6-18
openshift3/ose-docker-builder:v3.1.1.6-17
openshift3/ose-f5-router:v3.1.1.6-18
openshift3/ose-sti-builder:v3.1.1.6-17
openshift3/node:v3.1.1.6-18
aep3\_beta/aep-deployer:v3.1.1.6-18

| [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1331038#c5)  Andy Goldstein    2016-04-27 18:58:59 UTC  ``` This is happening in 3.1.1.6 with the docker build strategy. This is what's happening (via OSE's docker builder; I'm listing the rough equivalent CLI steps):  1. docker build -t $registry/$project/$image:latest 2. docker push $registry/$project/$image:latest 3. in parallel:   3a. image change trigger kicks off a deployment and it happens to land on the same node, this does 'docker pull $registry/$project/$image@sha256:...'   3. docker rmi $registry/$project/$image:latest  The removal of the image tagged :latest happens at about the same time that the image is being pulled by its sha256 digest. We see in the journalctl output for docker that the image removal is issued a bit before the pull by digest occurs. The image removal removes layers not in use by any other image/container, and the pull by digest is trying to pull them down at the same time.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1331038#c8)  Nicolas Dordet    2016-04-28 16:43:19 UTC  ``` Version is 3.1.1   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1331038#c20)  Wang Haoran    2016-05-03 05:51:49 UTC  ``` verified with : openshift v3.1.1.6-43-gf583589 kubernetes v1.1.0-origin-1107-g4c8e6f4 etcd 2.1.2   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1331038#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-05-11 13:33:19 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1038](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1038)   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1331038#c32)  Cesar Wong    2016-05-23 12:36:33 UTC  ``` Brenton, sorry I don't have a theory or explanation for why in the TSI case restarting the node could have made the patch start working.  While debugging with Matt, we did verify two things:  1) The image that the builds were using was the image that contained the fix. We did this by looking at the output of /usr/bin/origin version using the image of one of the completed build containers.  2) The symptoms we were seeing were consistent with the bug that was fixed in the new builder image. After a build completed, the image was no longer present in the local Docker, stalling the pre-deployment pod.   ``` |  |
