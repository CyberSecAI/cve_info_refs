There is a while loop that has this check to see whether there's still enough space in the buffer: 		if (!fb->len || wused > fb->len) {  If this is true more memory gets allocated. However this test won't be true if wused == fb->len, but at that point wused already points out of the buffer. Some lines later there's a write to the buffer: 		fb->wbuf[wused++] = wc;  The fix is simple: Check for wused >= fb->len instead. See attached patch.  This bug was found with the help of address sanitizer. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=93881#c1)  Guillem Jover    2016-01-27 16:28:02 UTC  ``` Thanks!

# libbsd: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201607-13**

A buffer overflow in libbsd might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libbsd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.2** |

### Background

This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems,
and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port
projects with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same code
over and over again on each project.

### Description

libbsd contains a buffer overflow in the fgetwln() function. An if
statement, which is responsible for checking the necessity to reallocate
memory in the target buffer, is off by one therefore an out of bounds
write occurs.

### Impact

Remote attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libbsd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot ">=dev-libs/libbsd-0.8.2"

```

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2016-5c3d057783
2016-12-31 03:55:57.197162

Fix heap buffer overflow in fgetwln()In the function fgetwln() there's a 4 byte heap overflow.
There is a while loop that has this check to see whether there's still
enough space in the buffer:
if (!fb->len || wused > fb->len) {
If this is true more memory gets allocated. However this test won't be
true if wused == fb->len, but at that point wused already points out
of the buffer. Some lines later there's a write to the buffer:
fb->wbuf[wused++] = wc;
This bug was found with the help of address sanitizer.

## [Heap buffer overflow in fgetwln function of libbsd](/36-Heap-buffer-overflow-in-fgetwln-function-of-libbsd.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Wednesday, January 27. 2016

libbsd is a library to provide common functions from BSD systems on Linux.

libbsd 0.8.1 and earlier contains a buffer overflow in the function fgetwln(). An if checks if it is necessary to reallocate memory in the target buffer. However this check is off by one, therefore an out of bounds write happens.

Upstream has released version 0.8.2 to fix this.

I have checked where this function gets used. I didn't find any code using it, so I assume the impact is limited.

This bug was found with the help of Address Sanitizer.

## Details

It was discovered that libbsd incorrectly handled certain inputs.

An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM. ([CVE-2016-2090](/security/CVE-2016-2090))

It was discovered that libbsd incorrectly handled certain strings.

An attacker could possibly use this issue to access sensitive information.
