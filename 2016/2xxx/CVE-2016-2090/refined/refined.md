Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-2090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error in the `fgetwln()` function within the libbsd library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The code incorrectly checks if there is enough space in the buffer before writing data, leading to a write out-of-bounds.
- The vulnerability lies in the conditional statement: `if (!fb->len || wused > fb->len)`. This condition fails to trigger when `wused == fb->len`, resulting in a write past the buffer boundary due to the subsequent `fb->wbuf[wused++] = wc;` statement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected process.
- Potential for remote exploitation: Although the impact was considered limited, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing input to the `fgetwln()` function that causes a specific allocation size leading to the overflow.
- An attacker would need to control or influence the input to `fgetwln()` to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input to an application or service using the vulnerable `libbsd` library.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found with the help of address sanitizer.
- The fix involves changing the condition in the while loop from `wused > fb->len` to `wused >= fb->len`.
