Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2943:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from sensitive information being stored in a log file within IBM BigFix Remote Control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the exposure of potentially sensitive data through log files. This means that information that should be kept confidential might be accessible to unauthorized users with sufficient privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with "higher than normal privileges" could potentially access sensitive information by reading the affected log files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves direct access to the log files on the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have "higher than normal privileges" on the system where the affected IBM BigFix Remote Control server is running. This suggests that the attacker must have some degree of elevated access to be able to read the log files, but the information does not specify the access level needed.
