ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handlingA slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
operating the master instance as it lacks of locking. Since the
master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
with it while changing the slave instance, too. Also, some linked
lists (active\_list and ack\_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
accesses.
This patch tries to address these issues. It adds spin lock of
timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
few places. For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
slave\_active\_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.
Also, ack and active\_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
snd\_timer\_stop() and snd\_timer\_close().
Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of \_snd\_timer\_stop()
at removing slave links. This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
readers wrt locking. Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.
Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
this hopefully fixes these issues.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information
leak or data loss.

CVE-2013-4312

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that users can use pipes queued on local
    (Unix) sockets to allocate an unfair share of kernel memory, leading
    to denial-of-service (resource exhaustion).

    This issue was previously mitigated for the stable suite by limiting
    the total number of files queued by each user on local sockets. The
    new kernel version in both suites includes that mitigation plus
    limits on the total size of pipe buffers allocated for each user.

CVE-2015-7566

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that the visor
    driver crashes when a specially crafted USB device without bulk-out
    endpoint is detected.

CVE-2015-8767

    An SCTP denial-of-service was discovered which can be triggered by a
    local attacker during a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way
    handshake.

CVE-2015-8785

    It was discovered that local users permitted to write to a file on a
    FUSE filesystem could cause a denial of service (unkillable loop in
    the kernel).

CVE-2015-8812

    A flaw was found in the iw_cxgb3 Infiniband driver. Whenever it
    could not send a packet because the network was congested, it would
    free the packet buffer but later attempt to send the packet again.
    This use-after-free could result in a denial of service (crash or
    hang), data loss or privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-8816

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the USB hub driver.
    This may be used by a physically present user for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2015-8830

    Ben Hawkes of Google Project Zero reported that the AIO interface
    permitted reading or writing 2 GiB of data or more in a single
    chunk, which could lead to an integer overflow when applied to
    certain filesystems, socket or device types. The full security
    impact has not been evaluated.

CVE-2016-0723

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the TIOCGETD ioctl.
    A local attacker could use this flaw for denial-of-service.

CVE-2016-0774

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 in kernel versions older
    than Linux 3.16 did not correctly handle the case of a partially
    failed atomic read. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
    to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user space.

CVE-2016-2069

    Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in flushing of the TLB
    when switching tasks on an x86 system. On an SMP system this could
    possibly lead to a crash, information leak or privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2384

    Andrey Konovalov found that a crafted USB MIDI device with an
    invalid USB descriptor could trigger a double-free. This may be used
    by a physically present user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2543

    Dmitry Vyukov found that the core sound sequencer driver (snd-seq)
    lacked a necessary check for a null pointer, allowing a user
    with access to a sound sequencer device to cause a denial-of-
    service (crash).

CVE-2016-2544, CVE-2016-2546, CVE-2016-2547, CVE-2016-2548

    Dmitry Vyukov found various race conditions in the sound subsystem
    (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound devices
    could use these to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2545

    Dmitry Vyukov found a flaw in list manipulation in the sound
    subsystem (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound
    devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2549

    Dmitry Vyukov found a potential deadlock in the sound subsystem
    (ALSA)'s use of high resolution timers. A user with access to sound
    devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (hang).

CVE-2016-2550

    The original mitigation of CVE-2013-4312, limiting the total number
    of files a user could queue on local sockets, was flawed. A user
    given a local socket opened by another user, for example through the
    systemd socket activation mechanism, could make use of the other
    user's quota, again leading to a denial-of-service (resource
    exhaustion). This is fixed by accounting queued files to the sender
    rather than the socket opener.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u3. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by CVE-2015-8830.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4. CVE-2015-7566, CVE-2015-8767 and
CVE-2016-0723 were already fixed in DSA-3448-1. CVE-2016-0774 does not
affect the stable distribution.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling

```
A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
operating the master instance as it lacks of locking.  Since the
master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
with it while changing the slave instance, too.  Also, some linked
lists (active_list and ack_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
accesses.

This patch tries to address these issues.  It adds spin lock of
timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
few places.  For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
slave_active_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.

Also, ack and active_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
snd_timer_stop() and snd_timer_close().

Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of _snd_timer_stop()
at removing slave links.  This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
readers wrt locking.  Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.

Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
this hopefully fixes these issues.

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

An update that solves 23 vulnerabilities and has 42 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP4 kernel was updated to receive various
security and bugfixes.
Following feature was added to kernel-xen:
- A improved XEN blkfront module was added, which allows more I/O
bandwidth. (FATE#320200) It is called xen-blkfront in PV, and
xen-vbd-upstream in HVM mode.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2013-7446: Use-after-free vulnerability in net/unix/af\_unix.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to bypass intended AF\_UNIX socket
permissions or cause a denial of service (panic) via crafted epoll\_ctl
calls (bnc#955654).
- CVE-2015-7515: An out of bounds memory access in the aiptek USB driver
could be used by physical local attackers to crash the kernel
(bnc#956708).
- CVE-2015-7550: The keyctl\_read\_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly use a semaphore, which allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system
crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
application that leverages a race condition between keyctl\_revoke and
keyctl\_read calls (bnc#958951).
- CVE-2015-8539: The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed local
users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (BUG) via crafted
keyctl commands that negatively instantiate a key, related to
security/keys/encrypted-keys/encrypted.c, security/keys/trusted.c, and
security/keys/user\_defined.c (bnc#958463).
- CVE-2015-8543: The networking implementation in the Linux kernel did not
validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer
dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging
CLONE\_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK\_RAW application
(bnc#958886).
- CVE-2015-8550: Compiler optimizations in the XEN PV backend drivers
could have lead to double fetch vulnerabilities, causing denial of
service
or arbitrary code execution (depending on the configuration)
(bsc#957988).
- CVE-2015-8551, CVE-2015-8552: xen/pciback: For
XEN\_PCI\_OP\_disable\_msi[|x] only disable if device has MSI(X) enabled
(bsc#957990).
- CVE-2015-8569: The (1) pptp\_bind and (2) pptp\_connect functions in
drivers/net/ppp/pptp.c in the Linux kernel did not verify an address
length, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism via a crafted
application (bnc#959190).
- CVE-2015-8575: The sco\_sock\_bind function in net/bluetooth/sco.c in the
Linux kernel did not verify an address length, which allowed local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR
protection mechanism via a crafted application (bnc#959190 bnc#959399).
- CVE-2015-8767: net/sctp/sm\_sideeffect.c in the Linux kernel did not
properly manage the relationship between a lock and a socket, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via a
crafted sctp\_accept call (bnc#961509).
- CVE-2015-8785: The fuse\_fill\_write\_pages function in fs/fuse/file.c in
the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop) via a writev system call that triggers a zero length for
the first segment of an iov (bnc#963765).
- CVE-2015-8812: A use-after-free flaw was found in the CXGB3 kernel
driver when the network was considered to be congested. This could be
used by local attackers to cause machine crashes or potentially code
execution (bsc#966437).
- CVE-2016-0723: Race condition in the tty\_ioctl function in
drivers/tty/tty\_io.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service
(use-after-free and system crash) by making a TIOCGETD ioctl call during
processing of a TIOCSETD ioctl call (bnc#961500).
- CVE-2016-2069: Race conditions in TLB syncing was fixed which could leak
to information leaks (bnc#963767).
- CVE-2016-2384: Removed a double free in the ALSA usb-audio driver in the
umidi object which could lead to crashes (bsc#966693).
- CVE-2016-2543: Added a missing NULL check at remove\_events ioctl in ALSA
that could lead to crashes. (bsc#967972).
- CVE-2016-2544, CVE-2016-2545, CVE-2016-2546, CVE-2016-2547,
CVE-2016-2548, CVE-2016-2549: Various race conditions in ALSAs timer
handling were fixed. (bsc#967975, bsc#967974, bsc#967973, bsc#968011,
bsc#968012, bsc#968013).
The following non-security bugs were fixed:
- alsa: hda - Add one more node in the EAPD supporting candidate list
(bsc#963561).
- alsa: hda - Apply clock gate workaround to Skylake, too (bsc#966137).
- alsa: hda - Fix playback noise with 24/32 bit sample size on BXT
(bsc#966137).
- alsa: hda - disable dynamic clock gating on Broxton before reset
(bsc#966137).
- Add /etc/modprobe.d/50-xen.conf selecting Xen frontend driver
implementation (bsc#957986, bsc#956084, bsc#961658).
- Fix handling of re-write-before-commit for mmapped NFS pages
(bsc#964201).
- nfsv4: Recovery of recalled read delegations is broken (bsc#956514).
- nvme: default to 4k device page size (bsc#967042).
- pci: leave MEM and IO decoding disabled during 64-bit BAR sizing, too
(bsc#951815).
- Refresh patches.xen/xen3-08-x86-ldt-make-modify\_ldt-synchronous.patch
(bsc#959705).
- Refresh patches.xen/xen-vscsi-large-requests (refine fix and also
address bsc#966094).

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-2546.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-2548.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-2547 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2547)

#### Description

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1027-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1027.35](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1027.35)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

arm64: kernel: fix architected PMU registers unconditional access
commit f436b2ac90a095746beb6729b8ee8ed87c9eaede upstream.
The Performance Monitors extension is an optional feature of the
AArch64 architecture, therefore, in order to access Performance
Monitors registers safely, the kernel should detect the architected
PMU unit presence through the ID\_AA64DFR0\_EL1 register PMUVer field
before accessing them.
This patch implements a guard by reading the ID\_AA64DFR0\_EL1 register
PMUVer field to detect the architected PMU presence and prevent accessing
PMU system registers if the Performance Monitors extension is not
implemented in the core.

arm64: kernel: enforce pmuserenr\_el0 initialization and restore
commit 60792ad349f3c6dc5735aafefe5dc9121c79e320 upstream.
The pmuserenr\_el0 register value is architecturally UNKNOWN on reset.
Current kernel code resets that register value iff the core pmu device is
correctly probed in the kernel. On platforms with missing DT pmu nodes (or
disabled perf events in the kernel), the pmu is not probed, therefore the
pmuserenr\_el0 register is not reset in the kernel, which means that its
value retains the reset value that is architecturally UNKNOWN (system
may run with eg pmuserenr\_el0 == 0x1, which means that PMU counters access
is available at EL0, which must be disallowed).
This patch adds code that resets pmuserenr\_el0 on cold boot and restores
it on core resume from shutdown, so that the pmuserenr\_el0 setup is
always enforced in the kernel.

arm64: mm: ensure that the zero page is visible to the page table walker
commit 32d6397805d00573ce1fa55f408ce2bca15b0ad3 upstream.
In paging\_init, we allocate the zero page, memset it to zero and then
point TTBR0 to it in order to avoid speculative fetches through the
identity mapping.
In order to guarantee that the freshly zeroed page is indeed visible to
the page table walker, we need to execute a dsb instruction prior to
writing the TTBR.

powerpc/module: Handle R\_PPC64\_ENTRY relocations
commit a61674bdfc7c2bf909c4010699607b62b69b7bec upstream.
GCC 6 will include changes to generated code with -mcmodel=large,
which is used to build kernel modules on powerpc64le. This was
necessary because the large model is supposed to allow arbitrary
sizes and locations of the code and data sections, but the ELFv2
global entry point prolog still made the unconditional assumption
that the TOC associated with any particular function can be found
within 2 GB of the function entry point:
func:
addis r2,r12,(.TOC.-func)@ha
addi r2,r2,(.TOC.-func)@l
.localentry func, .-func
To remove this assumption, GCC will now generate instead this global
entry point prolog sequence when using -mcmodel=large:
.quad .TOC.-func
func:
.reloc ., R\_PPC64\_ENTRY
ld r2, -8(r12)
add r2, r2, r12
.localentry func, .-func
The new .reloc triggers an optimization in the linker that will
replace this new prolog with the original code (see above) if the
linker determines that the distance between .TOC. and func is in
range after all.
Since this new relocation is now present in module object files,
the kernel module loader is required to handle them too. This
patch adds support for the new relocation and implements the
same optimization done by the GNU linker.

scripts/recordmcount.pl: support data in text section on powerpc
commit 2e50c4bef77511b42cc226865d6bc568fa7f8769 upstream.
If a text section starts out with a data blob before the first
function start label, disassembly parsing doing in recordmcount.pl
gets confused on powerpc, leading to creation of corrupted module
objects.
This was not a problem so far since the compiler would never create
such text sections. However, this has changed with a recent change
in GCC 6 to support distances of > 2GB between a function and its
assoicated TOC in the ELFv2 ABI, exposing this problem.
There is already code in recordmcount.pl to handle such data blobs
on the sparc64 platform. This patch uses the same method to handle
those on powerpc as well.

RELEASE+ACQUIRE, which are not fully ordered.
So also replace PPC\_RELEASE\_BARRIER and PPC\_ACQUIRE\_BARRIER with
PPC\_ATOMIC\_ENTRY\_BARRIER and PPC\_ATOMIC\_EXIT\_BARRIER in
\_\_{cmp,}xchg\_{u32,u64} respectively to guarantee fully ordered semantics
of atomic{,64}\_{cmp,}xchg() and {cmp,}xchg(), as a complement of commit
b97021f85517 ("powerpc: Fix atomic\_xxx\_return barrier semantics")
This patch depends on patch "powerpc: Make value-returning atomics fully
ordered" for PPC\_ATOMIC\_ENTRY\_BARRIER definition.

powerpc: Make value-returning atomics fully ordered
commit 49e9cf3f0c04bf76ffa59242254110309554861d upstream.
According to memory-barriers.txt:
> Any atomic operation that modifies some state in memory and returns
> information about the state (old or new) implies an SMP-conditional
> general memory barrier (smp\_mb()) on each side of the actual
> operation ...
Which mean these operations should be fully ordered. However on PPC,
PPC\_ATOMIC\_ENTRY\_BARRIER is the barrier before the actual operation,
which is currently "lwsync" if SMP=y. The leading "lwsync" can not
guarantee fully ordered atomics, according to Paul Mckenney:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/14/970
To fix this, we define PPC\_ATOMIC\_ENTRY\_BARRIER as "sync" to guarantee
the fully-ordered semantics.
This also makes futex atomics fully ordered, which can avoid possible
memory ordering problems if userspace code relies on futex system call
for fully ordered semantics.

powerpc/tm: Check for already reclaimed tasks
commit 7f821fc9c77a9b01fe7b1d6e72717b33d8d64142 upstream.
Currently we can hit a scenario where we'll tm\_reclaim() twice. This
results in a TM bad thing exception because the second reclaim occurs
when not in suspend mode.
The scenario in which this can happen is the following. We attempt to
deliver a signal to userspace. To do this we need obtain the stack
pointer to write the signal context. To get this stack pointer we
must tm\_reclaim() in case we need to use the checkpointed stack
pointer (see get\_tm\_stackpointer()). Normally we'd then return
directly to userspace to deliver the signal without going through
\_\_switch\_to().
Unfortunatley, if at this point we get an error (such as a bad
userspace stack pointer), we need to exit the process. The exit will
result in a \_\_switch\_to(). \_\_switch\_to() will attempt to save the
process state which results in another tm\_reclaim(). This
tm\_reclaim() now causes a TM Bad Thing exception as this state has
already been saved and the processor is no longer in TM suspend mode.
Whee!
This patch checks the state of the MSR to ensure we are TM suspended
before we attempt the tm\_reclaim(). If we've already saved the state
away, we should no longer be in TM suspend mode. This has the
additional advantage of checking for a potential TM Bad Thing
exception.
Found using syscall fuzzer.

batman-adv: Drop immediate orig\_node free function

It is not allowed to free the memory of an object which is part of a list
which is protected by rcu-read-side-critical sections without making sure
that no other context is accessing the object anymore. This usually happens
by removing the references to this object and then waiting until the rcu
grace period is over and no one (allowedly) accesses it anymore.
But the \_now functions ignore this completely. They free the object
directly even when a different context still tries to access it. This has
to be avoided and thus these functions must be removed and all functions

batman-adv: Avoid recursive call\_rcu for batadv\_nc\_node
[ Upstream commit 44e8e7e91d6c7c7ab19688750f7257292640d1a0 ]
The batadv\_nc\_node\_free\_ref function uses call\_rcu to delay the free of the
batadv\_nc\_node object until no (already started) rcu\_read\_lock is enabled
anymore. This makes sure that no context is still trying to access the
object which should be removed. But batadv\_nc\_node also contains a
reference to orig\_node which must be removed.
The reference drop of orig\_node was done in the call\_rcu function
batadv\_nc\_node\_free\_rcu but should actually be done in the
batadv\_nc\_node\_release function to avoid nested call\_rcus. This is
important because rcu\_barrier (e.g. batadv\_softif\_free or batadv\_exit) will
not detect the inner call\_rcu as relevant for its execution. Otherwise this
barrier will most likely be inserted in the queue before the callback of
the first call\_rcu was executed. The caller of rcu\_barrier will therefore
continue to run before the inner call\_rcu callback finished.

bridge: fix lockdep addr\_list\_lock false positive splat
[ Upstream commit c6894dec8ea9ae05747124dce98b3b5c2e69b168 ]
After promisc mode management was introduced a bridge device could do
dev\_set\_promiscuity from its ndo\_change\_rx\_flags() callback which in
turn can be called after the bridge's addr\_list\_lock has been taken
(e.g. by dev\_uc\_add). This causes a false positive lockdep splat because
the port interfaces' addr\_list\_lock is taken when br\_manage\_promisc()
runs after the bridge's addr list lock was already taken.
To remove the false positive introduce a custom bridge addr\_list\_lock
class and set it on bridge init.
A simple way to reproduce this is with the following:
$ brctl addbr br0
$ ip l add l br0 br0.100 type vlan id 100
$ ip l set br0 up
$ ip l set br0.100 up
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/vlan\_filtering
$ brctl addif br0 eth0

Ivaylo Dimitrov reported a regression caused by commit 7866a621043f
("dev: add per net\_device packet type chains").
skb->dev becomes NULL and we crash in \_\_netif\_receive\_skb\_core().
Before above commit, different kind of bugs or corruptions could happen
without major crash.
But the root cause is that phonet\_rcv() can queue skb without checking
if skb is shared or not.

bonding: Prevent IPv6 link local address on enslaved devices
[ Upstream commit 03d84a5f83a67e692af00a3d3901e7820e3e84d5 ]
Commit 1f718f0f4f97 ("bonding: populate neighbour's private on enslave")
undoes the fix provided by commit c2edacf80e15 ("bonding / ipv6: no addrconf
for slaves separately from master") by effectively setting the slave flag
after the slave has been opened. If the slave comes up quickly enough, it
will go through the IPv6 addrconf before the slave flag has been set and
will get a link local IPv6 address.
In order to ensure that addrconf knows to ignore the slave devices on state
change, set IFF\_SLAVE before dev\_open() during bonding enslavement.

udp: disallow UFO for sockets with SO\_NO\_CHECK option

Commit acf8dd0a9d0b ("udp: only allow UFO for packets from SOCK\_DGRAM
sockets") disallows UFO for packets sent from raw sockets. We need to do
the same also for SOCK\_DGRAM sockets with SO\_NO\_CHECK options, even if
for a bit different reason: while such socket would override the
CHECKSUM\_PARTIAL set by ip\_ufo\_append\_data(), gso\_size is still set and
bad offloading flags warning is triggered in \_\_skb\_gso\_segment().
In the IPv6 case, SO\_NO\_CHECK option is ignored but we need to disallow
UFO for packets sent by sockets with UDP\_NO\_CHECK6\_TX option.

tcp\_yeah: don't set ssthresh below 2
[ Upstream commit 83d15e70c4d8909d722c0d64747d8fb42e38a48f ]
For tcp\_yeah, use an ssthresh floor of 2, the same floor used by Reno
and CUBIC, per RFC 5681 (equation 4).
tcp\_yeah\_ssthresh() was sometimes returning a 0 or negative ssthresh
value if the intended reduction is as big or bigger than the current
cwnd. Congestion control modules should never return a zero or
negative ssthresh. A zero ssthresh generally results in a zero cwnd,
causing the connection to stall. A negative ssthresh value will be
interpreted as a u32 and will set a target cwnd for PRR near 4
billion.
Oleksandr Natalenko reported that a system using tcp\_yeah with ECN
could see a warning about a prior\_cwnd of 0 in
tcp\_cwnd\_reduction(). Testing verified that this was due to
tcp\_yeah\_ssthresh() misbehaving in this way.

vxlan: fix test which detect duplicate vxlan iface
[ Upstream commit 07b9b37c227cb8d88d478b4a9c5634fee514ede1 ]
When a vxlan interface is created, the driver checks that there is not
another vxlan interface with the same properties. To do this, it checks
the existing vxlan udp socket. Since commit 1c51a9159dde, the creation of
the vxlan socket is done only when the interface is set up, thus it breaks
that test.
Example:
$ ip l a vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 group 239.0.0.10 dev eth0 dstport 0
$ ip l a vxlan11 type vxlan id 10 group 239.0.0.10 dev eth0 dstport 0
$ ip -br l | grep vxlan
vxlan10 DOWN f2:55:1c:6a:fb:00
vxlan11 DOWN 7a:cb:b9:38:59:0d
Instead of checking sockets, let's loop over the vxlan iface list.

ALSA: timer: Handle disconnection more safely
commit 230323dac060123c340cf75997971145a42661ee upstream.
Currently ALSA timer device doesn't take the disconnection into
account very well; it merely unlinks the timer device at disconnection
callback but does nothing else. Because of this, when an application
accessing the timer device is disconnected, it may release the
resource before actually closed. In most cases, it results in a
warning message indicating a leftover timer instance like:
ALSA: timer xxxx is busy?
But basically this is an open race.
This patch tries to address it. The strategy is like other ALSA
devices: namely,
- Manage card's refcount at each open/close
- Wake up the pending tasks at disconnection
- Check the shutdown flag appropriately at each possible call
Note that this patch has one ugly hack to handle the wakeup of pending
tasks. It'd be cleaner to introduce a new disconnect op to
snd\_timer\_instance ops. But since it would lead to internal ABI
breakage and it eventually increase my own work when backporting to
stable kernels, I took a different path to implement locally in
timer.c. A cleanup patch will follow at next for 4.5 kernel.

ALSA: hrtimer: Fix stall by hrtimer\_cancel()
commit 2ba1fe7a06d3624f9a7586d672b55f08f7c670f3 upstream.
hrtimer\_cancel() waits for the completion from the callback, thus it
must not be called inside the callback itself. This was already a
problem in the past with ALSA hrtimer driver, and the early commit
[fcfdebe70759: ALSA: hrtimer - Fix lock-up] tried to address it.
However, the previous fix is still insufficient: it may still cause a
lockup when the ALSA timer instance reprograms itself in its callback.
Then it invokes the start function even in snd\_timer\_interrupt() that
is called in hrtimer callback itself, results in a CPU stall. This is
no hypothetical problem but actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.
This patch tries to fix the issue again. Now we call
hrtimer\_try\_to\_cancel() at both start and stop functions so that it
won't fall into a deadlock, yet giving some chance to cancel the queue
if the functions have been called outside the callback. The proper
hrtimer\_cancel() is called in anyway at closing, so this should be
enough.

commit 0a1f90a982e85f4921bed606a6b41a24f4de2ae1 upstream.
The machine uses codec alc255, and the pin configuration value for
pin 0x14 on this machine is 0x90171130 which is not in the pin quirk
table yet.

ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling
commit b5a663aa426f4884c71cd8580adae73f33570f0d upstream.
A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
operating the master instance as it lacks of locking. Since the
master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
with it while changing the slave instance, too. Also, some linked
lists (active\_list and ack\_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
accesses.
This patch tries to address these issues. It adds spin lock of
timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
few places. For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
slave\_active\_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.
Also, ack and active\_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
snd\_timer\_stop() and snd\_timer\_close().
Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of \_snd\_timer\_stop()
at removing slave links. This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
readers wrt locking. Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.
Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
this hopefully fixes these issues.

ALSA sequencer code has an open race between the timer setup ioctl and
the close of the client. This was triggered by syzkaller fuzzer, and
a use-after-free was caught there as a result.

ALSA: usb-audio: Avoid calling usb\_autopm\_put\_interface() at disconnect
commit 5c06d68bc2a174a6b82dce9f100f55173b9a5189 upstream.
ALSA PCM may still have a leftover instance after disconnection and
it delays its release. The problem is that the PCM close code path of
USB-audio driver has a call of snd\_usb\_autosuspend(). This involves
with the call of usb\_autopm\_put\_interface() and it may lead to a
kernel Oops due to the NULL object like:

x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch\_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
commit 71b3c126e61177eb693423f2e18a1914205b165e upstream.
When switch\_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
will be sent. In order for that to work correctly, the bit
needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
starting to fill the local TLB.
Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
a couple that were missing.

KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in join\_session\_keyring()
commit 23567fd052a9abb6d67fe8e7a9ccdd9800a540f2 upstream.
This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
This can be tested with the following program:
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main(int argc, const char \*argv[])
{
int i = 0;
key\_serial\_t serial;
serial = keyctl(KEYCTL\_JOIN\_SESSION\_KEYRING,
"leaked-keyring");
if (serial < 0) {
perror("keyctl");
return -1;
}
if (keyctl(KEYCTL\_SETPERM, serial,
KEY\_POS\_ALL | KEY\_USR\_ALL) < 0) {
perror("keyctl");
return -1;
}
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
serial = keyctl(KEYCTL\_JOIN\_SESSION\_KEYRING,
"leaked-keyring");
if (serial < 0) {
perror("keyctl");
return -1;
}
}
return 0;
}
If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
/proc/keys:
3f3d898f I--Q--- 100 perm 3f3f0000 0 0 keyring leaked-keyring: empty
with a usage count of 100 \* the number of times the program has been run,
then the kernel is malfunctioning. If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe

buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0774](/security/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](/security/CVE-2016-2069))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that
lacks a bulk-out endpoint (bnc#961512).
- CVE-2016-2549: sound/core/hrtimer.c in the Linux kernel did not prevent
recursive callback access, which allowed local users to cause a denial
of service (deadlock) via a crafted ioctl call (bnc#968013).
- CVE-2016-2547: sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel employed a locking
approach that did not consider slave timer instances, which allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (race condition,
use-after-free, and system crash) via a crafted ioctl call (bnc#968011).
- CVE-2016-2548: sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel retained certain
linked lists after a close or stop action, which allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted ioctl call,
related to the (1) snd\_timer\_close and (2) \_snd\_timer\_stop functions
(bnc#968012).
- CVE-2016-2546: sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel used an incorrect
type of mutex, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(race condition, use-after-free, and system crash) via a crafted ioctl
call (bnc#967975).
- CVE-2016-2545: The snd\_timer\_interrupt function in sound/core/timer.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly maintain a certain linked list, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (race condition and
system crash) via a crafted ioctl call (bnc#967974).
- CVE-2016-2544: Race condition in the queue\_delete function in

via a value that is (1) smaller than the minimum compliant value or (2)
larger than the MTU of an interface, as demonstrated by a Router
Advertisement (RA) message that is not validated by a daemon, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2015-0272 (bnc#955354).
- CVE-2015-7550: The keyctl\_read\_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly use a semaphore, which allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system
crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
application that leverages a race condition between keyctl\_revoke and
keyctl\_read calls (bnc#958951).
- CVE-2015-8569: The (1) pptp\_bind and (2) pptp\_connect functions in
drivers/net/ppp/pptp.c in the Linux kernel did not verify an address
length, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism via a crafted
application (bnc#959190).
- CVE-2015-8575: The sco\_sock\_bind function in net/bluetooth/sco.c in the
Linux kernel did not verify an address length, which allowed local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR
protection mechanism via a crafted application (bnc#959399).
- CVE-2015-8543: The networking implementation in the Linux kernel did not
validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer
dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging
CLONE\_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK\_RAW application
(bnc#958886).
- CVE-2015-8539: The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed local
users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (BUG) via crafted
keyctl commands that negatively instantiate a key, related to
security/keys/encrypted-keys/encrypted.c, security/keys/trusted.c, and
security/keys/user\_defined.c (bnc#958463).
- CVE-2015-7509: fs/ext4/namei.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a
crafted no-journal filesystem, a related issue to CVE-2013-2015
(bnc#956709).
- CVE-2015-7799: The slhc\_init function in drivers/net/slip/slhc.c in the
Linux kernel did not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl call
(bnc#949936).
- CVE-2015-8104: The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed guest OS
users to cause a denial of service (host OS panic or hang) by triggering
many #DB (aka Debug) exceptions, related to svm.c (bnc#954404).
- CVE-2015-5307: The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed guest OS
users to cause a denial of service (host OS panic or hang) by triggering
many #AC (aka Alignment Check) exceptions, related to svm.c and vmx.c
(bnc#953527).
- CVE-2015-7990: Race condition in the rds\_sendmsg function in
net/rds/sendmsg.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by using a socket that was not
properly bound (bnc#952384).
- CVE-2015-7872: The key\_gc\_unused\_keys function in security/keys/gc.c in
the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via crafted keyctl commands (bnc#951440).
- CVE-2015-6937: The \_\_rds\_conn\_create function in net/rds/connection.c in
the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact by using a socket that was not properly bound (bnc#945825).
- CVE-2015-6252: The vhost\_dev\_ioctl function in drivers/vhost/vhost.c in
the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(memory consumption) via a VHOST\_SET\_LOG\_FD ioctl call that triggers
permanent file-descriptor allocation (bnc#942367).
- CVE-2015-3339: Race condition in the prepare\_binprm function in
fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges by
executing a setuid program at a time instant when a chown to root is in
progress, and the ownership is changed but the setuid bit is not yet
stripped (bnc#928130).
The following non-security bugs were fixed:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1311566#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-02-24 13:26:59 UTC  ``` A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while operating the master instance as it lacks of locking. Since the master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope with it while changing the slave instance, too.  Upstream patch:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b5a663aa426f4884c71cd8580adae73f33570f0d>  External references:  <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=145269654327048> <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dvyukov/e833610757b098956b50/raw/d819cd13b466e4adbe3dd825ee481e4512e77633/gistfile1.txt>  CVE-ID request and assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/133>  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/410>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1311566#c1)  Josh Boyer    2016-02-24 13:57:34 UTC  ``` This was fixed in 4.3.5 with:  commit ea7f3d59628930dc29482a292e2a55c81cac52a4 Author: Takashi Iwai <tiwai> Date:   Thu Jan 14 16:30:58 2016 +0100      ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling          commit b5a663aa426f4884c71cd8580adae73f33570f0d upstream.       and in 4.4.1 with:  commit 8eff3aa0a9bbb593dce0ec0344ec1961318e44c8 Author: Takashi Iwai <tiwai> Date:   Thu Jan 14 16:30:58 2016 +0100      ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling          commit b5a663aa426f4884c71cd8580adae73f33570f0d upstream.

Subject: Security bugs in Linux kernel sound subsystem

Hi,

Dmitry Vyukov reported a series of kernel bugs in ALSA core that have been
triggered by syzkaller fuzzer. These can allow a user to DoS the system.

Please assign CVEs to the issues listed below. Thanks.

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 23 vulnerabilities and has 43 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP4 RT kernel was updated to receive various
security and bugfixes.
Following feature was added to kernel-xen:
- A improved XEN blkfront module was added, which allows more I/O
bandwidth. (FATE#320200) It is called xen-blkfront in PV, and
xen-vbd-upstream in HVM mode.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2013-7446: Use-after-free vulnerability in net/unix/af\_unix.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to bypass intended AF\_UNIX socket
permissions or cause a denial of service (panic) via crafted epoll\_ctl
calls (bnc#955654).
- CVE-2015-7515: An out of bounds memory access in the aiptek USB driver
could be used by physical local attackers to crash the kernel
(bnc#956708).
- CVE-2015-7550: The keyctl\_read\_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly use a semaphore, which allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system
crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
application that leverages a race condition between keyctl\_revoke and
keyctl\_read calls (bnc#958951).
- CVE-2015-8539: The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed local
users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (BUG) via crafted
keyctl commands that negatively instantiate a key, related to
security/keys/encrypted-keys/encrypted.c, security/keys/trusted.c, and
security/keys/user\_defined.c (bnc#958463).
- CVE-2015-8543: The networking implementation in the Linux kernel did not
validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer
dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging
CLONE\_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK\_RAW application
(bnc#958886).
- CVE-2015-8550: Compiler optimizations in the XEN PV backend drivers
could have lead to double fetch vulnerabilities, causing denial of
service
or arbitrary code execution (depending on the configuration)
(bsc#957988).
- CVE-2015-8551, CVE-2015-8552: xen/pciback: For
XEN\_PCI\_OP\_disable\_msi[|x] only disable if device has MSI(X) enabled
(bsc#957990).
- CVE-2015-8569: The (1) pptp\_bind and (2) pptp\_connect functions in
drivers/net/ppp/pptp.c in the Linux kernel did not verify an address
length, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism via a crafted
application (bnc#959190).
- CVE-2015-8575: The sco\_sock\_bind function in net/bluetooth/sco.c in the
Linux kernel did not verify an address length, which allowed local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR
protection mechanism via a crafted application (bnc#959190 bnc#959399).
- CVE-2015-8767: net/sctp/sm\_sideeffect.c in the Linux kernel did not
properly manage the relationship between a lock and a socket, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via a
crafted sctp\_accept call (bnc#961509).
- CVE-2015-8785: The fuse\_fill\_write\_pages function in fs/fuse/file.c in

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-83.127~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-83.127~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-83.127~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-83.127~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid for Trusty

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](/security/CVE-2016-2069))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
