Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-2037

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `cpio_safer_name_suffix` function when parsing cpio archive files. This occurs due to incorrect memory handling while extracting archive files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A heap buffer overflow occurs when writing past the allocated memory. Specifically, a write of size 2 occurs when the allocated space is insufficient

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The vulnerability can cause a crash of the cpio application due to the memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution:  While not explicitly stated, the advisory notes that exploiting this issue could "possibly execute arbitrary code".

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious cpio archive: The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into extracting a specially crafted cpio archive file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and deliver a malicious cpio archive to the victim.
- The victim must be convinced to use `cpio` to extract the malicious archive

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `util.c:1392` within the `cpio_safer_name_suffix` function, as per the provided ASAN report.
- The `process_copy_in` function in `copyin.c` calls `cpio_safer_name_suffix` and is part of the vulnerable code path.
- Patches for the issue involved ensuring there are at least two bytes available in `src/copyin.c` and adding a comment to `src/util.c`
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of cpio including the 2.11 version
