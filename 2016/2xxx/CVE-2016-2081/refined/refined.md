- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in VMware vRealize Log Insight.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows for the storage of malicious scripts, which are then executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to hijack an authenticated user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to inject malicious code that is stored by the application and executed when another user interacts with that stored data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to store data within the vRealize Log Insight application, and the victim needs to be an authenticated user of the same system.
