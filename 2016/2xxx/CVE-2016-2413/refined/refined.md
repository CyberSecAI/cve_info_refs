Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `BnOMX::onTransact` function within `IOMX.cpp`, where a pointer is used without proper initialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uninitialized pointer: The code uses a pointer that hasn't been assigned a valid memory location. This leads to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local code execution: An attacker could potentially achieve local code execution within the context of the media server process due to the memory corruption caused by the uninitialized pointer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector would involve exploiting the media server through a specially crafted media file or data stream, which triggers the vulnerable code path in `BnOMX::onTransact`.
- The vulnerability is triggered during processing of media files/data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the media server process. This can potentially be done remotely through methods such as MMS or web browsing, or through a local application.
- Local access to the device is necessary for local code execution.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to the media server process.
- The fix involves initializing the pointer and implementing error checks to prevent exploitation.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity, as it allows a local malicious app to execute code in the context of an elevated system application.

The provided patch initializes the uninitialized pointer, and introduces error checks before returning to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability.
