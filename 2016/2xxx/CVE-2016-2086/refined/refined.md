Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2086:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from Gentoo, GitHub, and Node.js explicitly mentions CVE-2016-2086 as a "Request Smuggling Vulnerability" affecting Node.js. The description of the vulnerability aligns with the general concept of request smuggling described in the IETF RFC 7230, section 9.5. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from defects in Node.js's HTTP header parsing, specifically related to the handling of `Content-Length`. The vulnerability arises from an improper parsing of the Content-Length header by Node.js. This results in discrepancies in how a request is interpreted, potentially allowing an attacker to inject requests that are not correctly parsed by intermediary servers.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Improper HTTP header parsing within Node.js.
    *   Inconsistent interpretation of `Content-Length` between Node.js and other HTTP implementations.
    *   Potential for discrepancies in request interpretation by different systems.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to "request smuggling" attacks.
    *   This allows attackers to potentially bypass security controls, access restricted resources, or manipulate how requests are handled. The impact of this vulnerability depends on the application and the network deployment, which makes it difficult to assess the scope of the vulnerability without a detailed analysis.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through maliciously crafted HTTP requests sent to a Node.js server or client.
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered when intermediaries are involved, where the differing interpretations of the Content-Length header can be exploited.
    *   The vulnerability could also be triggered when an attacker controls both ends of the connection.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Node.js server or client.
    *   The attacker needs to have sufficient knowledge of the target environment to craft a suitable request that is parsed differently by different applications in the system.

**3. Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was reported by RÃ©gis Leroy.
* The vulnerability was addressed by tightening up HTTP header parsing in Node.js to follow the formal HTTP specification in handling `Content-Length`.
* The advisory emphasizes the difficulty in assessing the vulnerability and recommends upgrades for all users to mitigate potential risk.
* The fix involves a change to the core HTTP parsing in nodejs itself, and affects both the server and client functions of the http module.

**4. Summary of relevant information**

The identified vulnerability is a request smuggling vulnerability due to an improper parsing of the Content-Length header in the nodejs HTTP module. This could result in an attacker being able to send malicious requests.
