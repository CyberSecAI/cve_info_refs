Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2190:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from the use of `target="_blank"` attribute in links without the `rel="noreferrer"` attribute. When a user clicks on a link with `target="_blank"`, the new page is opened in a new tab or window, and the original page has some level of access to the new page via the `window.opener` object. This can be exploited by a malicious external site, potentially to redirect the user or otherwise manipulate the original page.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- Missing `rel="noreferrer"` attribute on links with `target="_blank"`.
- This exposes the user to potential `window.opener` manipulation from malicious external websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious external website can potentially gain partial control over the original Moodle page which the user was browsing, by manipulating the `window.opener` object.
- This could allow an attacker to redirect the user, replace content, or perform other actions on the original Moodle page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user clicks on a link with `target="_blank"` that points to a malicious external website.
- The malicious website then uses the `window.opener` to manipulate the original Moodle page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or control a website that can be linked to from within Moodle.
- The attacker needs to understand how to use `window.opener` to manipulate the originating page.
- No special privileges or access to the Moodle server is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves automatically adding the `rel="noreferrer"` attribute to all links generated with `target="_blank"`, preventing the `window.opener` object from being set.
- The severity of this issue is considered "Minor."
- The affected versions include Moodle 3.0 to 3.0.2, 2.9 to 2.9.4, 2.8 to 2.8.10, 2.7 to 2.7.12 and earlier unsupported versions.
- The fix is included in Moodle versions 3.0.3, 2.9.5, 2.8.11, and 2.7.13
