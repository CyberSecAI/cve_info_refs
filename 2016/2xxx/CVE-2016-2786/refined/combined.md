Well, why force the user to do this in the first place? If this is truly correct, then the file GL/gl.h is "broken", as it has this #include which I quoted. It seems to me, that the solution is to either not move that glext file out of the way, or to patch gl.h as well. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Andrew Bevitt    2004-07-20 16:54:49 UTC  ``` Erm the link that you made manually opengl-update will make if you run  opengl-update xorg-x11  The point of moving glext.h was so that a link was made so different versions of glext.h could be used for different GL providers.  I'll add a more verbose message to the next commit of opengl-update but this isnt really a bug. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-09 16:38:19 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 58359](show_bug.cgi?id=58359 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - UQM compile problem glext.h cannot be found") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |
