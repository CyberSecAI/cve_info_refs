## Topic

An update for spacewalk-java is now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a
detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Satellite is a system management tool for Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and the remote management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.

Security Fix(es):

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in how XML data was handled in Red Hat Satellite. A user able to use the XMLRPC API could exploit this flaw to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users. (CVE-2015-0284)
* Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way certain form data was handled in Red Hat Satellite. A user able to enter form data could use these flaws to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users. (CVE-2016-2103, CVE-2016-3079)
* Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way HTTP GET parameter data was handled in Red Hat Satellite. A user able to provide malicious links to a Satellite user could use these flaws to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users. (CVE-2016-2104)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Willard (Raytheon Foreground Security) for reporting CVE-2016-2104. The CVE-2015-0284 and CVE-2016-3079 issues were discovered by Jan Hutař (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c0)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-01 18:21:54 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1305677](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2104 Satellite 5: stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities") +++  Adam Willard reports the following XSS flaws in Satellite 5:  /rhn/admin/BunchDetail.do?label=cobbler-sync-bunch"<script>alert(1)</script>  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539 /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>&channel_filter=539"><script>alert(3)</script>  <input type="hidden" name="package_name" value="sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="search_subscribed_channels" value="yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="channel_filter" value="539"><script>alert(3)</script>" />  --- Additional comment from Grant Gainey on 2016-02-15 16:08:43 EST ---  BunchDetail - rhn:toolbar and rl:listset tags need to stop trusting their input  Issues with "hidden":  396 total instances where we use either <html:hidden> or <input type="hidden>, and a value output with something like 'value="${param.ksid}"/>   214 'unique':  (1305677_XSS) ~/git/satellite/java $ find . -name \*.jsp\* | xargs grep hidden | grep 'value=\"${' | grep -v 'c:out' | cut -f 2- -d: | sort -b -u | wc -l 214  105 <html:hidden>, 109 <input type="hidden">  If the html:hidden values are coming from form-vars, then they should be getting scrubbed already (need some more investigation to verify). That would leave us with 109 instances that we'd just have to track down and store 'correctly'. Perhaps build an RhnHiddenTag that encodes its value, always, and force its use everywhere we currently use <input type="hidden">?  --- Additional comment from Grant Gainey on 2016-02-16 16:45:45 EST ---  BunchDetail - #c2 is incorrect. The issue here is constructs like the following:    <bean:message key="bunch.edit.jsp.toolbar" arg0="${label}"/>  where 'label' is set based on incoming parameter values:    String bunchLabel = request.getParameter("label");   request.setAttribute("label", bunchLabel);  To avoid the XSS attack, when/wherever we do BOTH of these things, setAttribute() must be called with a StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() around the value.  There are 196 instances in spacewalk we should check, to fix this kind-of problem.  RE the (over)use of <input type='hidden'> with unescaped values - I have a set of changes to HiddenInputTag.java, and a sed-script that converts all of our <input type="hidden"> to <rhn:hidden> instances, which enforce always using StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() on the value=. This needs more testing, to make sure it doesn't break anything.  --- Additional comment from Kurt Seifried on 2016-02-24 11:45:11 EST ---  Acknowledgments:  Name: Adam Willard of Raytheon Foreground Security   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c2)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-01 19:38:54 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github commits for the <input:hidden> issue:  c006504df8a66bea60d927a4c152e67bb75bebdf 94c03423b00670908d71960037a0bf376ba57f5e fd7d7b0d1483409f2f5833a95b409886dd9cb739 497f8c8804c4b72cac80a3b13c138e2c6e08cc7c 63e3ccec4130622059e9f89fd96bcc83269383d1 f1d8321cee97c56185c1144f8de5343167d38181  More work needed to address the <bean:message> issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c3)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-01 20:35:56 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github  f9444124d79af7604674be211a8ffc448b60aee9   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c4)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-02 16:35:14 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github: 5b21c52f8a64626ca50bd11573bde2e21c52919d 042c364db1b450ef9b4b4117dd81c98eade7f47c bc8026d722e058c8d77bb4735495581981db70d1   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c5)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-04 19:54:25 UTC  ``` Fixes to a number of <bean:message argN="${}"/> uses.  spacewalk.github: ec742b36ab79a0b91d67129dd814a48b980383ec 6fb0fbf5f625a99e8093b600dc8a1e90d6c34083   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c6)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-07 16:12:13 UTC  ``` Fixes missing for rhn:hidden - thanks to mcalmer  spacewalk.github: 6547ef2b84c7361b2fcdfb7a04e5b2fb5ad8c631 24c44bab07c9912df068b89796b44018ea11feaf   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-03-16 20:06:43 UTC  ``` Bug report changed to ON_QA status by Errata System.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-02-08 21:35:10 UTC  ``` Adam Willard reports the following XSS flaws in Satellite 5:  /rhn/admin/BunchDetail.do?label=cobbler-sync-bunch"<script>alert(1)</script>  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539 /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>&channel_filter=539"><script>alert(3)</script>  <input type="hidden" name="package_name" value="sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="search_subscribed_channels" value="yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="channel_filter" value="539"><script>alert(3)</script>" />   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c2)  Grant Gainey    2016-02-15 21:08:43 UTC  ``` BunchDetail - rhn:toolbar and rl:listset tags need to stop trusting their input  Issues with "hidden":  396 total instances where we use either <html:hidden> or <input type="hidden>, and a value output with something like 'value="${param.ksid}"/>   214 'unique':  (1305677_XSS) ~/git/satellite/java $ find . -name \*.jsp\* | xargs grep hidden | grep 'value=\"${' | grep -v 'c:out' | cut -f 2- -d: | sort -b -u | wc -l 214  105 <html:hidden>, 109 <input type="hidden">  If the html:hidden values are coming from form-vars, then they should be getting scrubbed already (need some more investigation to verify). That would leave us with 109 instances that we'd just have to track down and store 'correctly'. Perhaps build an RhnHiddenTag that encodes its value, always, and force its use everywhere we currently use <input type="hidden">?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c3)  Grant Gainey    2016-02-16 21:45:45 UTC  ``` BunchDetail - #c2 is incorrect. The issue here is constructs like the following:    <bean:message key="bunch.edit.jsp.toolbar" arg0="${label}"/>  where 'label' is set based on incoming parameter values:    String bunchLabel = request.getParameter("label");   request.setAttribute("label", bunchLabel);  To avoid the XSS attack, when/wherever we do BOTH of these things, setAttribute() must be called with a StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() around the value.  There are 196 instances in spacewalk we should check, to fix this kind-of problem.  RE the (over)use of <input type='hidden'> with unescaped values - I have a set of changes to HiddenInputTag.java, and a sed-script that converts all of our <input type="hidden"> to <rhn:hidden> instances, which enforce always using StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() on the value=. This needs more testing, to make sure it doesn't break anything.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2016-02-24 16:45:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Adam Willard (Raytheon Foreground Security)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-04-04 15:36:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 5.7  Via RHSA-2016:0590 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0590.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c0)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-01 18:21:54 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1305677](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-2104 Satellite 5: stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities") +++  Adam Willard reports the following XSS flaws in Satellite 5:  /rhn/admin/BunchDetail.do?label=cobbler-sync-bunch"<script>alert(1)</script>  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539 /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>&channel_filter=539"><script>alert(3)</script>  <input type="hidden" name="package_name" value="sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="search_subscribed_channels" value="yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="channel_filter" value="539"><script>alert(3)</script>" />  --- Additional comment from Grant Gainey on 2016-02-15 16:08:43 EST ---  BunchDetail - rhn:toolbar and rl:listset tags need to stop trusting their input  Issues with "hidden":  396 total instances where we use either <html:hidden> or <input type="hidden>, and a value output with something like 'value="${param.ksid}"/>   214 'unique':  (1305677_XSS) ~/git/satellite/java $ find . -name \*.jsp\* | xargs grep hidden | grep 'value=\"${' | grep -v 'c:out' | cut -f 2- -d: | sort -b -u | wc -l 214  105 <html:hidden>, 109 <input type="hidden">  If the html:hidden values are coming from form-vars, then they should be getting scrubbed already (need some more investigation to verify). That would leave us with 109 instances that we'd just have to track down and store 'correctly'. Perhaps build an RhnHiddenTag that encodes its value, always, and force its use everywhere we currently use <input type="hidden">?  --- Additional comment from Grant Gainey on 2016-02-16 16:45:45 EST ---  BunchDetail - #c2 is incorrect. The issue here is constructs like the following:    <bean:message key="bunch.edit.jsp.toolbar" arg0="${label}"/>  where 'label' is set based on incoming parameter values:    String bunchLabel = request.getParameter("label");   request.setAttribute("label", bunchLabel);  To avoid the XSS attack, when/wherever we do BOTH of these things, setAttribute() must be called with a StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() around the value.  There are 196 instances in spacewalk we should check, to fix this kind-of problem.  RE the (over)use of <input type='hidden'> with unescaped values - I have a set of changes to HiddenInputTag.java, and a sed-script that converts all of our <input type="hidden"> to <rhn:hidden> instances, which enforce always using StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() on the value=. This needs more testing, to make sure it doesn't break anything.  --- Additional comment from Kurt Seifried on 2016-02-24 11:45:11 EST ---  Acknowledgments:  Name: Adam Willard of Raytheon Foreground Security   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c2)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-01 19:38:54 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github commits for the <input:hidden> issue:  c006504df8a66bea60d927a4c152e67bb75bebdf 94c03423b00670908d71960037a0bf376ba57f5e fd7d7b0d1483409f2f5833a95b409886dd9cb739 497f8c8804c4b72cac80a3b13c138e2c6e08cc7c 63e3ccec4130622059e9f89fd96bcc83269383d1 f1d8321cee97c56185c1144f8de5343167d38181  More work needed to address the <bean:message> issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c3)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-01 20:35:56 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github  f9444124d79af7604674be211a8ffc448b60aee9   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c4)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-02 16:35:14 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github: 5b21c52f8a64626ca50bd11573bde2e21c52919d 042c364db1b450ef9b4b4117dd81c98eade7f47c bc8026d722e058c8d77bb4735495581981db70d1   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c5)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-04 19:54:25 UTC  ``` Fixes to a number of <bean:message argN="${}"/> uses.  spacewalk.github: ec742b36ab79a0b91d67129dd814a48b980383ec 6fb0fbf5f625a99e8093b600dc8a1e90d6c34083   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c6)  Grant Gainey    2016-03-07 16:12:13 UTC  ``` Fixes missing for rhn:hidden - thanks to mcalmer  spacewalk.github: 6547ef2b84c7361b2fcdfb7a04e5b2fb5ad8c631 24c44bab07c9912df068b89796b44018ea11feaf   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1313515#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-03-16 20:06:43 UTC  ``` Bug report changed to ON_QA status by Errata System.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-02-08 21:35:10 UTC  ``` Adam Willard reports the following XSS flaws in Satellite 5:  /rhn/admin/BunchDetail.do?label=cobbler-sync-bunch"<script>alert(1)</script>  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539  /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes&channel_filter=539 /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do?package_name=sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>&search_subscribed_channels=yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>&channel_filter=539"><script>alert(3)</script>  <input type="hidden" name="package_name" value="sac">Test<script>alert(1)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="search_subscribed_channels" value="yes">test<script>alert(2)</script>" /> <input type="hidden" name="channel_filter" value="539"><script>alert(3)</script>" />   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c2)  Grant Gainey    2016-02-15 21:08:43 UTC  ``` BunchDetail - rhn:toolbar and rl:listset tags need to stop trusting their input  Issues with "hidden":  396 total instances where we use either <html:hidden> or <input type="hidden>, and a value output with something like 'value="${param.ksid}"/>   214 'unique':  (1305677_XSS) ~/git/satellite/java $ find . -name \*.jsp\* | xargs grep hidden | grep 'value=\"${' | grep -v 'c:out' | cut -f 2- -d: | sort -b -u | wc -l 214  105 <html:hidden>, 109 <input type="hidden">  If the html:hidden values are coming from form-vars, then they should be getting scrubbed already (need some more investigation to verify). That would leave us with 109 instances that we'd just have to track down and store 'correctly'. Perhaps build an RhnHiddenTag that encodes its value, always, and force its use everywhere we currently use <input type="hidden">?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c3)  Grant Gainey    2016-02-16 21:45:45 UTC  ``` BunchDetail - #c2 is incorrect. The issue here is constructs like the following:    <bean:message key="bunch.edit.jsp.toolbar" arg0="${label}"/>  where 'label' is set based on incoming parameter values:    String bunchLabel = request.getParameter("label");   request.setAttribute("label", bunchLabel);  To avoid the XSS attack, when/wherever we do BOTH of these things, setAttribute() must be called with a StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() around the value.  There are 196 instances in spacewalk we should check, to fix this kind-of problem.  RE the (over)use of <input type='hidden'> with unescaped values - I have a set of changes to HiddenInputTag.java, and a sed-script that converts all of our <input type="hidden"> to <rhn:hidden> instances, which enforce always using StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() on the value=. This needs more testing, to make sure it doesn't break anything.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2016-02-24 16:45:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Adam Willard (Raytheon Foreground Security)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1305677#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-04-04 15:36:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 5.7  Via RHSA-2016:0590 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0590.html>   ``` |  |
