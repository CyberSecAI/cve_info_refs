  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-2104",
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way HTTP GET parameter data was handled in Red Hat Satellite. A user able to provide malicious links to a Satellite user could use these flaws to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Satellite 5.7"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The application failed to sanitize HTTP GET parameters leading to XSS vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker crafts a malicious link containing JavaScript payloads in the HTTP GET parameters and tricks a Red Hat Satellite user into clicking the link.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and have them accessed by a target user.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerable URLs include:\n  * /rhn/admin/BunchDetail.do\n  * /rhn/software/packages/NameOverview.do",
    "The application used <bean:message> tags with unsanitized user-provided data, and <input type='hidden'> fields were used with unsanitized values.",
    "The fix involved HTML escaping the values before being used in the affected contexts, specifically addressing the issues with  ListTagHelper.getFilterValue(),  <bean:message> and also implemented an RhnHiddenTag to enforce HTML escaping of the values in hidden input fields"
