- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The reset password functionality in BMC Remedy AR System Server can be manipulated to accept a blank previous password, allowing a user to reset their password without providing the old password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of the previous password during the password reset process. The system fails to enforce the requirement for a valid previous password, allowing an empty/blank string to be accepted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reset a user's password without knowing the original password, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the user's account and associated resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to access the password reset functionality and provide a blank previous password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the system's password reset interface and initiate a password reset.
