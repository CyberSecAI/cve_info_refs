The bugzilla entries discuss other CVEs.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS). This means that a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory block in the heap. The overflow is triggered when processing crafted ASN.1 data within an X.509 certificate.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Heap-based buffer overflow.
    *   Improper handling of ASN.1 data parsing in X.509 certificates.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious X.509 certificate.
    *   Denial of service (application crash) due to memory corruption.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is network-based. Remote attackers send a crafted X.509 certificate to a vulnerable application using NSS.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send or present the crafted X.509 certificate to a vulnerable application, which could be done remotely.
    *   No authentication is needed.
    *   The attacker does require some knowledge of ASN.1 structures and X.509 certificates.

**3. Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   The SUSE document also provides CVSS scores.
    *   CVSS v2:  AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P (Base Score: 6.8)
    *   CVSS v3:  CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Base Score: 8.8)
*   The severity of the issue is rated as 'important' by SUSE.
*   It also provides references to SUSE Bugzilla entries and SUSE Security Advisories which fixed this issue in various products.
*   The document also lists fixed package versions for various SUSE products.
*   The openSUSE bugzilla entry for CVE-2016-2806 references this vulnerability.
