Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-2779:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `runuser` utility in `util-linux` not properly isolating the terminal input buffer between the parent (invoking) process and the child (executed as the target user) process.
- The `TIOCSTI` ioctl allows a process to push characters into the terminal's input buffer. This functionality, when combined with the lack of isolation in `runuser`, enables a malicious child process to inject commands into the parent's terminal session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Isolation:** The primary vulnerability is the failure of `runuser` to properly isolate the terminal's input buffer when switching user contexts. It allows a child process to write into the parent's TTY input buffer via `TIOCSTI`.
- **Unrestricted `TIOCSTI` usage:** The `TIOCSTI` ioctl, by default, could be used by any process with access to the terminal device file. This was a weakness in the kernel design that allowed the exploit to work.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A non-privileged user executing a program via `runuser -u <nonpriv_user> <program>` can inject commands into the terminal session of the privileged user that executed `runuser`, potentially leading to root-level privilege escalation if run as root by the parent.
- **TTY Hijacking:** The attacker effectively hijacks the terminal of the parent process, inserting malicious commands into the parent session's shell.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system and be able to execute code as a user who can be specified as a target of `runuser`.
- **`runuser` usage:** The attacker needs to run a program via `runuser` to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user who has the ability to run programs as another user using `runuser`. Typically, this implies the parent user of `runuser` is a privileged user (like root) and the child process runs as a less privileged user.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a program as the less privileged user which then calls `TIOCSTI`.
- The attacker needs to be able to compile and execute code that utilizes the `TIOCSTI` ioctl.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability is similar to issues previously found in `su` and `sudo`.
- The fix for `su` was to use `setsid()`, and in `sudo` to use a `use_pty` flag, but these were not adequate for `runuser` as they caused other issues.
- The issue was fixed in `util-linux` by introducing a new `--pty` option that creates a new pseudoterminal to separate the privileged and unprivileged sessions, avoiding the ioctl vulnerability. This was not enabled by default, requiring the command-line option.
- A more robust fix, discussed in the context of the bug report, would be restricting the use of `TIOCSTI` in the kernel, only allowing it for privileged users with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. This was implemented in `grsecurity` kernel patch.
- The `runuser` utility uses the same code as `su` for handling user sessions, leading to `runuser` also having the `--pty` option introduced as a fix.
- Debian acknowledged that a fix based on kernel hardening is a better approach for this vulnerability.
