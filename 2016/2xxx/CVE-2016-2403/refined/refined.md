Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-2403:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Symfony handles LDAP bind operations, specifically when an empty password is provided.
- According to RFC 4513, LDAP allows for anonymous authentication by providing a distinguished name and a zero-length password.
- Misconfigured LDAP servers might allow this unauthenticated mechanism.
- The Symfony Security component, when using simple bind with a zero length password, could establish an anonymous authorization state, leading to unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Improper handling of empty passwords in LDAP authentication.
- Failure to validate password length before performing LDAP bind operations.
- Reliance on potentially misconfigured LDAP servers that allow anonymous binds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Unauthorized access to the system or application.
- Bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Attacker provides a valid distinguished name and an empty password when prompted for credentials on the vulnerable Symfony application which uses LDAP for authentication.
- The vulnerable application then relays this empty password to the LDAP server, potentially gaining unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to interact with an application using Symfony's security component for LDAP authentication.
- The attacker must be able to submit an empty password as authentication.
- The targeted LDAP server must be misconfigured to allow simple bind operations with empty passwords.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in Symfony versions 2.8.0 to 2.8.5 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.5.
- The fix implemented in versions 2.8.6 and 3.0.6 introduces a check on the provided password to prevent the use of empty passwords.
