```

## Description

quote website [1]

> PuTTY is a free implementation of SSH and Telnet for Windows and Unix platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator. It is written and maintained primarily by Simon Tatham.

## Summary

The putty SCP command-line utility (pscp) is missing a bounds-check for a stack
buffer when processing the SCP-SINK file-size response to a SCP download request.
This may allow a malicious server to overwrite the stack buffer within the client-
application potentially leading to remote code execution.

PoC attached.
patch attached.

Besides that, two minor issues have been reported in putty packet handling:

* DoS condition in the parsing of SSH-Strings that lead to a nullptr read. (connect putty to `poc.py` and type `x11exploit` to trigger one of multiple occurrence of a crash, also works with x11forwarding disabled in putty)
* DoS condition in the handling of unrequested forwarded-tcpip channels open requests that lead to a nullptr read. (connect putty to `poc.py` and type `forwardedtcpipcrash` to trigger crash)

## Details

The vulnerable code is located in `pscp.c` [4] line 1498 (HEAD) and is based on an
unbound `sscanf` string format descriptor storing an arbitrary length string in
a 40byte fixed size stack buffer `sizestr[40]`.

Inline annotations are prefixed with `//#!`

```
1491         /*
1492          * If we get here, we must have seen SCP_SINK_FILE or
1493          * SCP_SINK_DIR.
1494          */
1495         {
1496             char sizestr[40];										//#! fixed size buffer
1497
1498             if (sscanf(act->buf, "%lo %s %n", &act->permissions,   //#! unbound cstr %s written to sizestr
1499                        sizestr, &i) != 2)

```

## Proof of Concept

Prerequisites:

* install python 2.7.x
* issue `#> pip install paramiko` to install `paramiko` ssh library for python 2.x
* make sure `poc.py` and `test_rsa.key` are in the same folder

poc:

```
Usage:   [<listen_ip:port>] [--no-checks]
Default:  0.0.0.0:22

--no-checks ... disable client banner checks (for testing putty clones)

```

1. start the malicious sshd by running `poc.py` which by default will bind all ips, port 22.

   ```
    INFO     monkey-patch paramiko.Transport.open_channel
    INFO     monkey-patch paramiko.Transport._check_banner
    INFO     --start--
    INFO     ServerHostKey: 60733844cb5186657fdedaa22b5a57d5
    INFO     BIND: ('0.0.0.0', 22)
    INFO     Listening for connection ...
    ...

   ```
2. try to retrieve any file from the malicious sshd by executing `pscp`. Provide any user/password/pubkey, the server will just accept anything.

   ```
    c:\> pscp.exe -scp root@localhost:/etc/passwd .
    root@localhost's password: anything

   ```
3. key-exchange and authentication

   ```
    ...

   ```
4. `pscp` tries to retrieve file. Server responds with fake timestamps, permissions and an overly long filesize string overflowing the 40byte client buffer.

## Troubleshooting

**Q**: `ImportError: No module named py3compat`

**A**: outdated `paramiko` please upgrade with `pip install --upgrade paramiko`

## Remediation Steps

* provide length to `sscanf` conversion specifier `%s` with a max of `sizeof(sizestr)-1` `%39s` (see attached `pscp.patch`)

  ```
    diff --git a/pscp.c b/pscp.c

Vendor response: see [5]

PuTTY clones based on the vulnerable version are probably affected. run `#> poc.py 0.0.0.0:22 --no-checks` to disable client banner checks

* affected (`kscp.exe`): KiTTY <= 0.66.6.3 [6]

```
platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator. It is written and
maintained primarily by Simon Tatham.

Summary
-------

The putty SCP command-line utility (pscp) is missing a bounds-check for a
stack
buffer when processing the SCP-SINK file-size response to a SCP download
request.
This may allow a malicious server to overwrite the stack buffer within the
client-
application potentially leading to remote code execution.

PoC see ref github.
Patch see ref github.

Besides that, two minor issues have been reported in putty packet handling:

* DoS condition in the parsing of SSH-Strings that lead to a nullptr read.
(connect putty to `poc.py` and type `x11exploit` to trigger one occurrence
of a crash, also works with x11forwarding disabled in putty)
* DoS condition in the handling of unrequested forwarded-tcpip channels open
requests that lead to a nullptr read. (connect putty to `poc.py` and type
`forwardedtcpipcrash` to trigger crash)

Details
-------

The vulnerable code is located in `pscp.c` [4] line 1498 (HEAD) and is based
on an
unbound `sscanf` string format descriptor storing an arbitrary length string
in
a 40byte fixed size stack buffer `sizestr[40]`.

Inline annotations are prefixed with `//#!`

1491         /*
1492          * If we get here, we must have seen SCP_SINK_FILE or
1493          * SCP_SINK_DIR.
1494          */
1495         {
1496             char sizestr[40];
//#! fixed size buffer
1497
1498             if (sscanf(act->buf, "%lo %s %n", &act->permissions,   //#!
unbound cstr %s written to sizestr
1499                        sizestr, &i) != 2)

Proof of Concept
----------------

Prerequisites:

* install python 2.7.x
* issue `#> pip install paramiko` to install `paramiko` ssh library for
python 2.x
* make sure `poc.py` and `test_rsa.key` are in the same folder

poc:

    Usage:   [<listen_ip:port>]
    Default:  0.0.0.0:22

1. start the malicious sshd by running `poc.py` which by default will bind
all ips, port 22.

INFO     monkey-patch paramiko.Transport._check_banner

INFO     BIND: ('0.0.0.0', 22)
INFO     Listening for connection ...
...

2. try to retrieve any file from the malicious sshd by executing `pscp`.
Provide any user/password/pubkey, the server will just accept anything.

c:\> pscp.exe -scp root@localhost:/etc/passwd .
root@localhost's password: anything

3. key-exchange and authentication

permissions and an overly long filesize string overflowing the 40byte client
buffer.

This update is so far missing from 13.2, 42.1, and should be sent there too. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=981407#c1)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-05-24 16:00:20 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (981407) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/397740> 42.1 / putty <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/397742> 13.2 / putty ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=981407#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-05-24 18:35:18 UTC  ``` <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2563> <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-pscp-sink-sscanf.html>  class: vulnerability: This is a security vulnerability. difficulty: fun: Just needs tuits, and not many of them. priority: high: This should be fixed in the next release. present-in: 0.66 fixed-in: 0.67  Many versions of PSCP prior to 0.67 have a stack corruption vulnerability in their treatment of the 'sink' direction (i.e. downloading from server to client) of the old-style SCP protocol.  In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, the user must connect to a malicious server and attempt to download any file.  (Note however that the vulnerability kicks in after host key verification, so the host key of the server has to have been accepted to get this far.)  This vulnerability only arises in the old SCP protocol, so you can work around it in a vulnerable PSCP by using the -sftp option to force the use of the newer SFTP protocol, provided your server supports that protocol.  This bug was discovered by tintinweb and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-2563.  Vulnerability details: Prior to any download in the SCP sink protocol, the server sends a line of text consisting of an octal number encoding Unix file permissions, a decimal number encoding the file size, and the file name. Since the file size can exceed 232 bytes, and in some compilation configurations of PuTTY the host platform's largest integer type is only 32 bits wide, PuTTY extracts the decimal file size into a temporary string variable to send to its own 64-bit decimal decoding function. Unfortunately, that extraction was done carelessly, using a sscanf with no length limit, permitting a buffer overrun. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=981407#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-05-24 18:43:13 UTC  ``` update running, thanks ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=981407#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-05-31 17:08:50 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:1453-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
