- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer when processing a project file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Access violation memory error due to a memory buffer overflow when a maliciously crafted or altered project file is loaded into the Rockwell Automation's Integrated Architecture Builder (IAB) application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target computer with the same privileges as the user running the IAB tool. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain control of the system or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a local user opening a maliciously crafted project file within the IAB application, thus requiring physical access or social engineering tactics to deliver the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious project file, deliver it to a system running a vulnerable version of IAB, and then convince a local user to open the file.
