Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the Minikin library, specifically related to how it handles fonts with invalid `cmap` tables. A maliciously crafted or corrupted font may have a negative size in its `cmap` range, leading to an overflow in the Minikin component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is an integer overflow that occurs when processing the `cmap` table of a font with a negative size. This overflow can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, which can manifest as a continuous reboot loop. The device becomes temporarily unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** A local attacker, typically an application installed on the device, can trigger the vulnerability. This requires the attacker to have the capability to load untrusted fonts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to load a malicious font. This typically means having the ability to install an application on the device capable of triggering the Minikin library to load this crafted font.
- The attacker must be a local user or an application running on the affected device.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided Android source code commits (mentioned as AOSP links) show the fix for the vulnerability, which includes adding error logging for invalid `cmap` tables and rejecting fonts with invalid ranges in the `cmap`.
-  The vulnerability was reported by Weichao Sun of Alibaba Inc.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity because of the potential for a reboot loop.

**In summary, CVE-2016-2414 is a denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by a maliciously crafted font that can cause a reboot loop. This vulnerability is exploited locally through an application capable of loading untrusted fonts. The root cause is an integer overflow when parsing the font's cmap table, allowing a negative size to cause memory corruption.**
