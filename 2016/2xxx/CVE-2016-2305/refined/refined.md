Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-2305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or neutralize malicious input within the URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The application is vulnerable to DOM-based XSS because it doesn't neutralize input during web page generation, specifically within the URL. This allows execution of attacker-supplied JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could perform malicious actions on the SCADA software by executing arbitrary JavaScript code. This could allow an attacker to change settings, disrupt operations, or potentially gain further access to the system, although the impact is limited to modification of the application (Integrity).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL containing malicious HTML and JavaScript.
*   The victim needs to click a specially crafted link or visit a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that exploits the XSS vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user of the application into clicking the crafted URL. The user must be a legitimate user of the SCADA application, but no specific privileges are required.
*   The attack is **remote**, and no prior authentication is required.
