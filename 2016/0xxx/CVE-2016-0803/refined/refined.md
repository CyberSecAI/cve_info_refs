Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the `mediaserver` process handles specially crafted media files during processing, leading to memory corruption. Specifically, the issue is related to memory allocation in `SoftMPEG4Encoder` and `SoftVPXEncoder` within the `libstagefright` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability exists due to inadequate checking of requested memory sizes before allocation within `SoftMPEG4Encoder` and `SoftVPXEncoder`.
- This can lead to an out-of-bounds write or read, causing the `mediaserver` process to crash or allowing remote code execution

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the `mediaserver` process. This process has access to audio and video streams as well as access to elevated privileges.
- **System Compromise:**  Compromising the `mediaserver` process can allow an attacker to perform malicious actions, potentially leading to device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Media File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when `mediaserver` processes a specially crafted media file or data. This can occur via various channels, such as:
    - **MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service):** Receiving a malicious media file via MMS.
    - **Web Browsing:** Viewing a webpage containing malicious media content.
    - **Other Applications:** Any application that utilizes `mediaserver` for media processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, needing only to send or provide a crafted media file to the vulnerable device.
- **No user interaction:** The attack can be triggered without user interaction in some scenarios e.g. with MMS.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is considered a "Critical" severity issue.
- The fix involves checking requested memory sizes before allocation for the `SoftMPEG4Encoder` and `SoftVPXEncoder`.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 4.4.4, 5.0, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1.
