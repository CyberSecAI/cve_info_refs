  "CVE-2016-0048": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory management"
    ],
    "Impact": "Elevation of privilege, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to log on to the system and run a specially crafted application."
