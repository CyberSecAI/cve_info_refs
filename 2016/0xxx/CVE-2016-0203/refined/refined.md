Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-0203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the IBM Cloud Orchestrator task API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The task API might allow an authenticated user to view background information related to actions performed on virtual machines within projects they belong to. This implies a lack of proper access controls or information hiding within the API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An authenticated user could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive background information about virtual machine actions. The impact is limited to information disclosure and does not allow for modification or deletion of resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the task API itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within a project to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to access the task API and have the ability to perform actions on virtual machines within the projects they are a member of.

**Additional Details:**

*   The CVSS v3 vector is `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`. This means the attack complexity is low, no user interaction is required and there is a high impact on confidentiality.
*   The vulnerability affects IBM Cloud Orchestrator V2.5, V2.5.01, V2.4, V2.4.0.1, V2.4.0.2, V2.4.0.3.
*   The recommended remediation is to upgrade to Fix Pack 2 (2.5.0.2) or later for the 2.5 versions and to Fix Pack 4 (2.4.0.4) for 2.4 versions.
