## Cumulative Security Update for Microsoft Edge (3142019)

Published: March 8, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerability by:

* Modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory
* Changing how Microsoft Edge handles the referrer policy

For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Edge Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.

## Microsoft Edge Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0125

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly handles the referrer policy. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain information about the request context or browsing history of a user.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must convince a user who is accessing a secure website to click a link that takes the user to a malicious website. The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how Microsoft Edge handles the referrer policy.
