- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ping function is available to every user, leading to a memory leak in the affected device. This is due to improper release of memory before removing the last reference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Release of Memory Before Removing Last Reference ('Memory Leak') (CWE-401)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a memory leak on the affected device, and potentially a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the ping function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send ping requests to the affected device. No special privileges or user interaction is needed.
