```
(CVE) ID: CVE-2016-0762
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Tomcat's Realm implementations handle passwords during user authentication. Specifically, the password processing logic was not executed when a supplied username did not exist, leading to a timing discrepancy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to timing attacks. Because the password processing only occurs for existing users, an attacker can use timing differences to infer whether a username exists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** A successful timing attack would allow an attacker to enumerate valid user names on the system, a crucial step in a subsequent attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network:** This attack can be performed remotely by sending authentication requests with potentially invalid usernames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Tomcat server.
- **No authentication:** The attacker does not require prior authentication or credentials for this particular attack vector.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Mitigation:** The provided Red Hat Bugzilla entry mentions that the default configuration includes the `LockOutRealm`, which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder but does not eliminate it.
- **Patches:** The provided information indicates that patches are available for multiple Tomcat versions (6.0.47, 7.0.72, 8.5.5, 8.0.37).
- **Affected systems**: Various affected products like 'OnCommand Insight', 'OnCommand Shift', and 'Snap Creator Framework', from Netapp are listed as well.
- **Affected distributions:** Various RedHat and Ubuntu distrubutions are affected.
