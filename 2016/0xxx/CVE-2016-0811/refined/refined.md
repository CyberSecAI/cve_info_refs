Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in an information disclosure issue within the `libmediaplayerservice`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The vulnerability allows for a bypass of security measures that are designed to make it more difficult for attackers to exploit the platform. This suggests a flaw in the way `libmediaplayerservice` handles certain data or operations, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could lead to an information disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, it could permit a bypass of security measures in place to increase the difficulty of attackers exploiting the platform. Furthermore, the vulnerability is rated High severity because it could also be used to gain elevated capabilities, such as Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions privileges, which are not accessible to third-party applications. This means a malicious actor could gain more control over a device than they should normally have.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the `libmediaplayerservice` library. The specific method of triggering this vulnerability is not explicitly stated, but it's implied to be a case of information leakage during processing within the `libmediaplayerservice`. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would likely need to have a local application running on the affected device to exploit this vulnerability. No specific user interaction is mentioned as needed, beyond the presence of the malicious application. It is implied that an attacker would need to be able to access functionality that interacts with `libmediaplayerservice`.

**Additional details:**
* The issue is rated as "High" severity
* The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0 and 6.0.1.
* The vulnerability was reported on Nov 16, 2015.
* The fix was implemented in AOSP commit `22f824feac43d5758f9a70b77f2aca840ba62c3b`.
