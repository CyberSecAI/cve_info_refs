Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2016-0711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input when creating or renaming links, pages, or folders within the Jetspeed portal. Specifically, HTML tags are allowed in the names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary weakness is that the application allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the name of a link, page, or folder, which is then stored and rendered to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:**  When a user views a page, link or folder with injected javascript, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser. This could enable an attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   Modify the content of the page the victim is viewing.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads within the names of links, pages, or folders using the application's normal functionality, specifically via AJAX requests to rename or create these objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the permission to add or rename links, pages, or folders in the portal. The example shows the user `andreas` performing the action.
