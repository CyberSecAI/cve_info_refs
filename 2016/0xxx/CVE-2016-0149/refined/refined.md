{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2016-0149",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way the .NET encryption component sends and receives encrypted network packets. Specifically, it arises from improper handling of split TLS/SSL records.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of TLS/SSL records",
      "Information disclosure due to insufficient encryption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to decrypt encrypted SSL/TLS traffic, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack",
      "Injection of unencrypted data into the secure channel"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between a client and a server, and inject data into the secure channel. It also requires the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the legitimate server.",
     "Mitigation": "Enabling TLS1.2 mitigates the vulnerability. Also, the vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way that the .NET encryption component sends and receives encrypted network packets."
