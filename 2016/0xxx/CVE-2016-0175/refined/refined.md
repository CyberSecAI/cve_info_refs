### Summary of CVE-2016-0175

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure within the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) to properly handle memory addresses. Specifically, it doesn't correctly manage references to a font object after its resources have been freed, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in font handling within the Windows kernel-mode driver.
- Failure to remove references to freed font resources.
- Exposes kernel memory addresses, potentially bypassing KASLR.

**Impact:**
- An attacker can retrieve kernel memory addresses, which could allow them to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR). This information could be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker must log on to an affected system.
- The attacker must run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability occurs during the handling of fonts, specifically when references to a font are not properly removed after the font is freed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log on to a system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code, as they need to run a malicious application on the targeted system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability allows information disclosure, specifically the retrieval of memory addresses of kernel objects.
- A use-after-free condition occurs when a reference to a freed font is used.
- This vulnerability is related to other Win32k vulnerabilities fixed in the same update (MS16-062)
