- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could execute script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting web site, potentially stealing the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted URL that, when clicked by the victim, triggers the malicious script execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick the victim into clicking the link, but does not need to be authenticated to the application.
