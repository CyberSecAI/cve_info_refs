{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IMemory interface in Android's frameworks/native/libs/binder/IMemory.cpp does not properly validate sizes and offsets when passing shared memory across the Binder IPC channel. Specifically, the sizes in IMemory and IMemoryHeap are not checked relative to each other, nor is the offset in IMemory checked against the size of IMemoryHeap.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of input sizes and offsets when handling shared memory.",
      "Lack of proper checks when mapping shared memory regions.",
      "Reliance on user-controlled sizes and offsets."
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application can craft fake IMemory and IMemoryHeap objects that lie about their values, leading to information disclosure and/or memory corruption. This can be exploited to achieve arbitrary memory reads and writes within the context of a privileged system application.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting malicious IMemory and IMemoryHeap objects.",
      "Exploiting IPC services that use the IMemory interface to trigger out-of-bounds memory access.",
       "Manipulating sizes and offsets to access arbitrary memory locations or cause memory corruption."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to execute code locally on the Android device and interact with a service that utilizes the vulnerable IMemory interface, either directly or indirectly through another service."
