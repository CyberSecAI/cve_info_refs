Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0724:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in two enrolment-related web services within Moodle: `core_enrol_get_course_enrolment_methods` and `enrol_self_get_instance_info`. These web services did not properly check user permissions to access hidden courses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of sufficient access control checks within the specified web services. They allowed users to potentially access information about hidden courses without proper authorization, violating the intended visibility restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially obtain information about hidden courses, including their enrolment methods and instance information. While described as a "Minor" risk, this exposure could lead to further unauthorized activities or a breach of confidentiality, such as revealing course content, structure, or ongoing activity to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Service API Abuse:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the affected web services APIs.
*   **External Access:**  External users could exploit the vulnerability, indicating that an attacker does not require a local/internal account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make calls to the vulnerable web services. No high level of privilege is needed to take advantage of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported by Juan Leyva and tracked under issue number MDL-52072.
