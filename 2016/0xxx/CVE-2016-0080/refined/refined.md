Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Edge handles exceptions when dispatching certain window messages. This improper handling allows an attacker to probe the layout of the address space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). ASLR is a security feature designed to make it harder for attackers to predict where code and data will be loaded into memory. By bypassing this, an attacker gains knowledge of the memory layout, making further exploitation more feasible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The ASLR bypass does not allow for arbitrary code execution on its own. However, it significantly lowers the difficulty of exploiting other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution flaws. By gaining knowledge of the address space layout, an attacker can leverage another vulnerability with greater reliability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires a user to be logged on and running a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge. The user would then need to browse to a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate one. They need to entice or trick the user into visiting the malicious site with the vulnerable browser.

**Summary of Technical Details**
- The vulnerability is a security feature bypass related to improper exception handling during window message dispatch in Microsoft Edge.
- By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass ASLR, which is a memory randomization technique.
- The ASLR bypass alone does not lead to code execution but facilitates exploitation of other vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution vulnerabilities).
- The attacker needs to get a user with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge to visit a malicious website.
