Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of URL parameters in Tivoli Business Service Manager (TBSM). This allows arbitrary Javascript code to be appended to TBSM URLs and executed on the server side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw due to the absence of proper input sanitization. Specifically, the URL parameters are not checked or cleaned to remove potentially malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code on the server-side.  This could potentially allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, or denial of service. The impact can vary depending on the specifics of the attacker's payload and the permissions of the user whose session is being exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs that contain malicious Javascript in their parameters. An attacker would need to entice a user to click on such a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and convince a user of the vulnerable TBSM application to click on them. No special privileges are mentioned beyond the need to have access to the vulnerable application.

**Summary**
This is a classic XSS vulnerability caused by lack of input sanitization and allows arbitrary Javascript execution by crafting malicious URLs.
