Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from weak access control configurations within specific IBM Informix services. The content mentions three services:
    *   portmap service
    *   nsrexecd service
    *   nsrd service
*   Specifically, the weak access control allows authenticated local users to modify the binary files associated with these services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The core issue is that any authenticated local user has the ability to modify the service binaries. This goes against the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying the service binaries, attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the SYSTEM user. This gives them complete control over the system, bypassing all security restrictions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to execute code as SYSTEM allows the attacker to perform a wide range of malicious actions, such as installing malware, stealing data, or disrupting system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users with valid accounts on the affected system.
*   **Malicious File Modification:** The attack vector involves modifying the executable files associated with the vulnerable services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the system where the vulnerable IBM Informix installation exists.
*   **Write Access to Service Binaries:** The attacker needs write access to the executable files for portmap, nsrexecd, or nsrd services.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions user interaction is needed, since the target needs to "visit a malicious page or open a malicious file." This is not directly part of the privilege escalation flaw itself, but could be how an attacker could get a foothold on a target system in the first place.
*   IBM has released a fix to address this vulnerability, specifically for  IBM Informix Dynamic Server v 11.70.xCn (Windows).

The provided content offers more specific information than the basic CVE description which reads "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval". The content clarifies that the vulnerability affects the portmap, nsrexecd, and nsrd services, all due to weak access controls which allow local users to modify their binaries and run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
