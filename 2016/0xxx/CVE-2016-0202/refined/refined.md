Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how IBM Cloud Orchestrator handles tasks, specifically the backend object generated for handling actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- An authenticated user can view any task within their domain, even those not belonging to them. This indicates a lack of proper access control and authorization checks on task visibility.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized visibility into other users' tasks within the same domain. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information related to those tasks. However, the exploit does not allow modification or deletion of tasks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation requires an attacker to have valid user credentials on the IBM Cloud Orchestrator platform.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the platform.
- The vulnerability is exploited by viewing the tasks using the "View All User Domain Tasks" function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user on the IBM Cloud Orchestrator platform.
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account that belongs to the same domain as the targeted task.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS base score of 3.3 (Low severity).
- Affected versions include IBM Cloud Orchestrator V2.4, V2.4.0.1, V2.4.0.2, V2.4.0.3 and V2.3, V2.3.0.1.
- The recommended solution is to upgrade to Fix Pack 4 (2.4.0.4) for 2.4 versions or contact IBM Support for 2.3 versions.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations provided.
