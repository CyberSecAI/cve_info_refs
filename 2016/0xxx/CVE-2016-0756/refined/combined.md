# What is Prosody?

Prosody is a [modern](https://modernxmpp.org/) [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) communication server. It aims to be
easy to set up and configure, and efficient with system resources.
Additionally, for developers it aims to be easy to extend and give a
flexible system on which to rapidly develop added functionality, or
prototype new protocols.

Prosody is open-source software under the permissive [MIT/X11 license](/source/mit).

## What is an XMPP server?

[XMPP](/doc/xmpp) is an open and free alternative to
commercial messaging and chat providers. Set it up for your company,
organisation, or just your family and friends. You are in control, and
your communication is private to you. Supporting a wide range of client
software for desktop and mobile platforms, you can chat using Prosody
from any device.

In addition, your Prosody can [link up with](/doc/s2s)
other Prosody installations and other XMPP-compatible services to form
an open communication network, whilst allowing everyone full control
over who they connect to, and who they share data with.

,
[security](/tags/security)

We are pleased to announce a new minor release from our stable branch.

This release fixes another dialback security issue. We strongly encourage all
Prosody servers to upgrade as soon as possible.

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate your server on the XMPP network.
A full security advisory can be found [here](https://prosody.im/security/advisory-20160127/).
Many thanks to Thijs Alkemade for discovering and reporting the issue.

We also have a number of other fixes and improvements made since 0.9.9.

A summary of changes in this release:

## Security

* mod\_dialback: Adopt key generation algorithm from XEP-0185, to prevent impersonation attacks (CVE-2016-0756)

## Fixes and improvements

* Startup: Open /dev/urandom read-only, to fix a failure to start on some systems (fixes [#585](https://prosody.im/issues/issue/585))
* Networking: Improve handling of the ‚Äòselect‚Äô network backend running out of file descriptors

## Minor changes

* Networking: Increase default internal read size to prevent connections stalling with LuaEvent (see [#583](https://prosody.im/issues/issue/583))
* DNS: Discard queries that failed to send due to connection errors (fixes [#598](https://prosody.im/issues/issue/598))
* c2s, s2s: Lower priority of shutdown handler, so that modules such as MUC can always send shutdown notifications to (remote) users (fixes [#601](https://prosody.im/issues/issue/601))

# Download

As usual, download instructions for many platforms can be found on our [download page](https://prosody.im/download)

## #585 prosody 0.9.9: opening /dev/urandom as r+

   With the prosody 0.9.9 update, prosody tries to open /dev/urandom as r+ (instead of just r) in util/uuid.lua (see [1]). This causes a crash if prosody isn't running as root and constitutes quite a disruptive change for a small, stable update.
   Furthermore, the ability to write to /dev/urandom is never really used inside the code, except for the seed function in the same file, which as far as I can tell is never getting called anywhere else in the code.
   Since urandom usually doesn't require seeding[2] to generate secure random values, the functionality in itself seems superfluous and should probably be removed or at least be made optional.
   [1] <https://hg.prosody.im/trunk/file/c633e1338554/util/uuid.lua#l11>
   [2] except at system start, which is usually handled by the startup script.

   Oh jeez, I just realized that this might actually be a bug in the openvz setup in which prosody is running, as urandom is actually 666 (I've assumed 644 without looking it up), but writing to urandom is not permitted in the container. The system in question is a Debian 6.0.10 (yes, old :/), prosody (as well as most of the required libraries) is installed via the <http://packages.prosody.im/debian> squeeze main repository.
   For completeness, here's the error message that is generated at startup:
   Starting Prosody XMPP Server: prosody/usr/bin/lua5.1: /usr/lib/prosody/util/uuid.lua:27: Unable to obtain a secure random number generator, please see <https://prosody.im/doc/random> (/dev/urandom: Operation not permitted)
   stack traceback:
   [C]: in function 'error'
   /usr/lib/prosody/util/uuid.lua:27: in function 'uuid\_gen'
   /usr/lib/prosody/core/hostmanager.lua:77: in function 'activate'
   /usr/lib/prosody/core/hostmanager.lua:44: in function '?'
   /usr/lib/prosody/util/events.lua:67: in function 'fire\_event'
   /usr/bin/prosody:337: in function 'prepare\_to\_start'
   /usr/bin/prosody:403: in main chunk
   [C]: ?
   I suppose this issue could be closed, as it is strictly speaking not a prosody error, but rather a problem in the setup that doesn't permit write access to urandom. Sorry for the noise. :/
   (Just a remark: Is urandom opened before or after root privileges are dropped? If urandom is opened as the user, then this might still fail on systems such as OpenBSD, where urandom is 644. Maybe such a failure should be handled more... gracefully?)

   Thanks for the further information, it's helpful :)
   I'm going to leave the issue open for a bit, while we decide what and whether we'll do about it. You aren't the first person to have problems with urandom permissions today (though the other was seemingly unrelated, and due to a custom AppArmor profile).
   So it's not totally broken, but if a few people are having trouble with it then it's worth reviewing. We tried our best to test on different systems, but obviously can never catch everything.
   Regarding dropping root... Prosody itself never runs as root. We do have root-dropping code in prosodyctl, as that's sometimes run as root for convenience, but it just switches to the prosody user before launching the daemon. We decided to keep it this way and cut out a whole category of potential security issues.

   I too have a custom AppArmor profile and see no good reason to grant prosody write access to urandom; the <abstractions/base> profile grants only read access to [u]random.
   Please don't require more permission on the system than you actually need.
   Also this is kinda bad in a security update.

   Hi Stefan, thanks for the comment. I'm sorry you've been affected by this issue also.
   Firstly let me clarify that under Linux writing to urandom is a harmless operation (see man urandom), and on all the systems we tested before the release it worked fine. And the majority of users have indeed had no problem with it.
   Our switch to using urandom was considered the best of a number of options, e.g. as it did not add any extra dependencies (which would also be kinda bad in a security update). We tried to make the best choice we could in the circumstances.
   Writing to urandom came as an attempt to preserve the existing semantics of the code as much as possible, which already had a seed() function to feed data into the random number generator. In hindsight this could have become a no-op during the switch to urandom (i.e. we would always assume urandom is well-fed) if we had known it would cause issues for some people, but obviously we weren't blessed with hindsight at the time.
   We're going to remove the requirement for write access in the next minor update.

   Hi guys,
   I wanted to give prosody a try, but I'm running into the same error on Ubuntu 14.04.
   When can we expect the next minor update?
   Thx for your work!

   The next release will be in the coming week, very soon.
   Anyone who posts here and is affected by the issue, I'm still curious to hear what kind of environment you folk are running Prosody under (we still don't have a very clear picture of who exactly is affected). I think most of the issues have come down to AppArmor and some virtualization systems so far. And possibly some flavours of BSD.
9. **Benedikt Wilzoch**
   on
   [2016-01-24](#comment-9)

   Hey,
   yes I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a VPS (virtualization system: Linux-VServer).
   I remember having a problem with another program due to a denied access on the random number generator because of the virtualization. So I guess in my case virtualization causes the error.

    SELinux prevents Prosody from writing to /dev/urandom; I just remembered to <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1076979> where I had exactly the same issue with Heimdal last year. SELinux covers all Fedora and RHEL/CentOS releases by default. I already backported the patch from the nightly builds into the RPM about 14+ days ago to satisfy Fedora user complaints.

# Prosody security advisory 2016/01/27

## CVE-2016-0756

Project
Prosody XMPP server

URL
https://prosody.im/

CVE
CVE-2016-0756

Date

2016-01-27

Affected versions
All versions prior to 0.9.10

Affected Prosody modules
mod\_dialback

Fixed versions

0.9.10, 0.10 nightly build 201, trunk nightly build 612

## Description

The flaw allows a malicious server to impersonate the vulnerable domain to any XMPP domain whose domain name includes the attacker's domain as a suffix.

For example, 'bber.example' would be able to connect to 'jabber.example' and successfully impersonate any vulnerable server on the network.

## Affected configurations

The default configuration is affected. Servers with mod\_dialback disabled are not affected.

Servers with s2s\_secure\_auth enabled will reject incoming impersonation attempts (that is, servers attempting to impersonate other domains will be rejected), but may still be impersonated to other servers on the network.

## Temporary mitigation

Disable mod\_dialback by adding "dialback" to your modules\_disabled list in the global section of your config file, and restart Prosody:

modules\_disabled = { "dialback" }

Note that disabling dialback will affect interoperability with servers that do not have trusted TLS certificates.

## Advice

All users should upgrade to 0.9.10, or check their OS distribution for security updates. Users of development branches (0.10, trunk) should upgrade to the latest nightly builds.

## Credits

The flaw was discovered and responsibly disclosed to us by Thijs Alkemade.

## #596 Dialback key generation in 0.9 allows servers to impersonate to suffices

   1. example.lit connects to foo.example.lit claiming to be prosody.lit on the initial stream header
   2. foo.example.lit offers dialback and stream ID "abc"
   3. example.lit triggers a connection from prosody.lit to example.lit
   4. example.lit offers dialback and stream ID "abcfoo."
   5. prosody.lit generates SHA256("abcfoo.example.litprosody.litb97b59cd-f9f8-4d5e-b43f-96107303c30e") as dialback key: <https://hg.prosody.im/0.9/file/0386ccf20ac7/plugins/mod_dialback.lua#l22>
   6. example.lit forwards this dialback key to foo.example.lit
   7. foo.example.lit connects back to prosody.lit
   8. prosody.lit says the key is valid
   9. example.lit is now authorized to send messages to foo.example.lit pretending to be from prosody.lit
   The target domain doesn't strictly need to subdomain, just a suffix: alice.example.lit could be impersonated by lice.example.lit. This is pretty common for things like no-ip.org.
   The problem is the lack of separation of the different fields in generate\_dialback(). XEP-0185 fixes this by requiring spaces between the different parts. <https://hg.prosody.im/0.10/rev/dd8265ca9327> implemented that, but only for 0.10+.

Subject: CVE-2016-0756: Prosody XMPP server: insecure dialback key
 generation/validation algorithm

A vulnerability has been found and fixed in the Prosody XMPP server.

CVE-2016-0756
-------------

Project
  ~ Prosody XMPP server
URL
  ~ <https://prosody.im/>
CVE
  ~ CVE-2016-0756
Date
  ~ 2016-01-27

Affected versions
  ~ All versions prior to 0.9.10
Affected Prosody modules
  ~ mod_dialback
Fixed versions
  ~ 0.9.10, 0.10 nightly build 201, trunk nightly build 612

Description
-----------

The flaw allows a malicious XMPP server to impersonate the vulnerable
domain to any
XMPP domain whose domain name includes the attacker's domain as a suffix.

For example, 'bber.example' would be able to connect to 'jabber.example' and
successfully impersonate any vulnerable server on the network.

Affected configurations
-----------------------

The default configuration is affected. Servers with mod_dialback
disabled are not affected.

Servers with s2s_secure_auth enabled will reject incoming
impersonation attempts (that is,
servers attempting to impersonate other domains will be rejected), but
may still be impersonated to other servers on the network.

Temporary mitigation
--------------------

Disable mod_dialback by adding "dialback" to your modules_disabled
list in the global
section of your config file, and restart Prosody:

   modules_disabled = { "dialback" }

Note that disabling dialback will affect interoperability with servers
that do not have trusted
TLS certificates.

Advice
------

All users should upgrade to 0.9.10, or check their OS distribution for
security updates. Users of development branches (0.10, trunk) should
upgrade to the latest nightly builds.

-------

The flaw was discovered and responsibly disclosed to us by Thijs Alkemade.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them ‚Äî but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
