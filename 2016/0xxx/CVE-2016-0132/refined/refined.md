  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2016-0132": {
      "summary": "The security feature bypass exists in a .NET Framework component that does not properly validate certain elements of a signed XML document.",
      "root_cause": "The .NET Framework component does not properly validate certain elements of a signed XML document.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper XML validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could modify the contents of an XML file without invalidating the signature associated with the file. If a .NET application relies on the signature to be non-malicious, the behavior of the application could become unpredictable.",

        "Modifying contents of XML files"

        "required_capabilities": [
          "Ability to modify XML file content"
