Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **integer overflow** within the Advantech WebAccess `datacore.exe` service, specifically when handling the `0x791E` IOCTL in the Kernel subsystem. This integer overflow leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow (CWE-680):** A crafted RPC request to the Kernel service causes a stack-based buffer overflow due to an integer overflow during memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Administrator Privileges:** The attacker gains the ability to execute code within the context of an administrator on the system.
*   **System Compromise:** Full control of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **RPC Requests:** A specially crafted RPC request to the Kernel service is used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **IOCTL:** The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the `0x791E` IOCTL in the Kernel subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely without prior authentication.
*   **Low Skill:** The advisory indicates that an attacker with low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **No Authentication Required**: Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) advisory (ZDI-16-104) provides more technical detail than the ICS-CERT advisory.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 according to ICS-CERT and a CVSS v2 score of 9.3 according to ZDI, reflecting its critical nature.
*   Advantech has released a patch (WebAccess Version 8.1) to mitigate this and other vulnerabilities.
