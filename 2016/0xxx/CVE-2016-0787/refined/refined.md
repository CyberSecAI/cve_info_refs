Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A "bits/bytes confusion bug" in the `diffie_hellman_sha256` function within `kex.c` of the libssh2 library. The code incorrectly passed the number of bytes to a random number generation function `_libssh2_bn_rand` that expected the number of bits.
- Specifically, the `group_order` variable was used directly without multiplying it by 8 to convert bytes to bits, leading to a dramatically reduced number of random bits being used in Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Randomness:** The secret key generated during the Diffie-Hellman handshake was significantly shorter than intended (128 or 256 bits instead of 1023 or 2047 bits), resulting in weak keys.
- **Improper Parameter Handling:** The code failed to correctly convert bytes to bits before using the parameter for random number generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Weakened Handshake Security:** The drastically reduced amount of random bits used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange significantly weakened the handshake security making it easier to compromise.
- **Potential for Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** A man-in-the-middle attacker with sufficient resources could decrypt or intercept SSH sessions due to the compromised key exchange.
- **Confidentiality breach:**  An attacker might be able to decrypt intercepted SSH sessions.
- **Denial of Service:** (In conjunction with other libssh2 flaws not part of this CVE)

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned between the client and server could intercept and potentially decrypt the SSH session by exploiting the weak key exchange.
- **Network Traffic Interception:** By capturing the initial handshake data and exploiting the insufficient key length, the attacker could compute the shared secret.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and server.
- **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs sufficient computational power to break the weakened Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all libssh2 versions up to and including 1.6.0
- libssh2 version 1.7.0 and later contains the fix, which converts number of bytes to number of bits correctly before calling the random number function.
- A patch is available at: `<https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2016-0787.patch>`
- The issue was reported to the libssh2 project by Andreas Schneider on February 7, 2016.
- libssh2 1.7.0 was released on February 23rd, 2016, in coordination with the vulnerability disclosure.

The content provides a clear picture of the root cause of the vulnerability (bits/bytes confusion), its impact (weakened key exchange and possible MitM), and the fix (correct byte-to-bit conversion).
