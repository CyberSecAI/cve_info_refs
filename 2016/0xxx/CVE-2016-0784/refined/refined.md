Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0784:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when handling file names within ZIP archives during the Import/Export System Backups process in Apache OpenMeetings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application fails to sanitize filenames within uploaded ZIP archives, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write files to locations outside the intended backup directory by including path traversal sequences in filenames within a malicious ZIP archive.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By writing a malicious file (e.g., a shell script) to a location like `/usr/bin/convert` (or another executable) and then triggering its execution by uploading a image file, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious ZIP Archive:** The attacker crafts a ZIP archive containing files with names that include path traversal sequences.
- **Upload via Backup Import Functionality:** The attacker uses the Import/Export System Backups functionality in the OpenMeetings Administration menu to upload the malicious archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the OpenMeetings Administration menu, which likely requires administrative privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files/archives using the backup import functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apache OpenMeetings versions 1.9.x up to (but not including) 3.1.1.
- The provided content from `exploit-db.com` and `openwall.com` is consistent with the CVE description and provides more details.
- The exploit uses the backup import feature and the fact that the ZIP archive is not properly sanitized to overwrite executables which could lead to RCE when the system uses the overwritten executable.
