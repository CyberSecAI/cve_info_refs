# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities affect multiple IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities affect the IBM Jazz based Applications: Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM), and Rational Software Architect (RSA DM).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0273](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0273)IBM Jazz based Applications are vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111053> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0372](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0372) **DESCRIPTION:** IBM Jazz based Applications could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to set the secure flag for the session cookie in SSL mode. By intercepting its transmission within an HTTP session, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to capture the cookie and obtain sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 3.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112091> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0284](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0284) **DESCRIPTION:** IBM Jazz based Applications could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a XML external entity (XXE) error when processing XML data by the XML parser. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0285](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0285) **DESCRIPTION:** IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a field to inject malicious script into a Web page which would be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the page is viewed. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4
