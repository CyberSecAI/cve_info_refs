- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks because it does not properly validate the origin of requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests that appear to come from an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force an authenticated user's browser to send unauthorized requests to the vulnerable web application, leading to actions performed on behalf of the attacker without the user's consent. This could include actions like deleting user accounts or modifying data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTML form (or similar) containing a request to perform a specific action on the target application. The attacker would trick the user into loading the malicious HTML form via email, link, or another method. When the userâ€™s browser loads the malicious HTML form, it will also send any authentication cookies associated with the target site. If the target site doesn't validate the requests against the cookie, it will perform the action in the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious HTML form.
    - The attacker must trick an authenticated user into accessing the crafted HTML form in their browser while being logged in to the vulnerable application. The user needs to have the permission to execute the actions that are being forged by the attacker.
    - The attacker needs to know the structure of the request to be able to forge it. In the specific example, the attacker must know that the `sNo` field in the form corresponds to the ID of the user to be deleted.
