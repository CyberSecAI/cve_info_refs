### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM InfoSphere Information Server Framework, Information Server Governance Catalog and Information Server Business Glossary are vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

Note:

1. The same fix may be listed under multiple vulnerabilities. Installing the fix addresses all vulnerabilities to which the fix applies. Also, some fixes require installing both a fix pack and a subsequent patch. While the fix pack must be installed first, any additional patches required may be installed in any order.

2. For IBM InfoSphere Information Server version 8.5, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.
