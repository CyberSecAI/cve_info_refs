Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-0451

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Oracle GoldenGate `mgr` process.
- The `mgr` process, which listens on TCP port 7809, fails to authenticate connecting machines.
- This lack of authentication allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary files to any location on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The most significant weakness is the lack of proper authentication for incoming connections to the `mgr` process.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The vulnerability allows attackers to write files to any location on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the `mgr` process. This could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability over the network by connecting to the vulnerable service listening on TCP port 7809.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the target machine's port 7809.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on 2015-07-10 and publicly disclosed on 2016-01-22
- Oracle has released an update to patch this vulnerability.
