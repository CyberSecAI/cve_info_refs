- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input leads to cross-site request forgery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send a malformed HTTP request by persuading an authenticated user to visit a malicious website, potentially leading to cross-site scripting attacks, web cache poisoning, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to persuade an authenticated user to visit a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be remote and needs to be able to persuade an authenticated user to visit a malicious web site. The attacker also requires knowledge of the targeted system and ability to craft malicious HTTP requests.
