- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to all JSP pages within the application structure under certain circumstances.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows for subsequent probing and exploitation of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N) and requires low privileges (PR:L), the attack complexity is low(AC:L) and no user interaction is required(UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. They would need low privileges but they don't need any specific user interaction.
