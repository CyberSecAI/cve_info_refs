Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-0057:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an invalidly signed binary within Microsoft Office software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Security feature bypass. An attacker can replace a legitimate but invalidly signed binary with a malicious one and use it to execute malicious code. The weakness lies in the fact that the binary is not correctly signed which could allow an attacker to bypass security controls that rely on checking the validity of the binary signature to differentiate between a known good binary and a malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the user that triggers the malicious binary. This could lead to:
  -  Taking control of the affected system (if the user has administrative rights)
  -  Installation of malware
  -  Data theft
  -  Data modification or deletion
  -  Creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs write access to the location of the invalidly signed binary to replace the original file with their own malicious one.
- The malicious binary would then be triggered by either an application or a user, thereby causing the malicious code to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires write access to the directory containing the vulnerable binary.
- The attacker must wait for an application or user to trigger the execution of their replaced binary

The provided document also indicates that a security update addresses this vulnerability by providing a validly signed binary.
