**CVE-2016-0503**

*   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability within the Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of the MySQL server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is present in the DML handling of the MySQL Server, which is exploited by authenticated users over network.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack results in a denial of service by crashing the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote network attacks by authenticated users of the affected database server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must have network access to the MySQL server.
    *   Attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the server.

**CVE-2016-0504**

*   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability within the Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of the MySQL server, different than CVE-2016-0503.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability resides in the way DML is handled in MySQL Server, exploitable over the network.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  A successful attack results in a denial of service by crashing the server
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Remote network attacks by authenticated users of the affected database server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must have network access to the MySQL server.
    *   Attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the server.

**CVE-2016-0505**

*   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability within the Options handling of the MySQL server.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is present in the handling of the Options in MySQL Server which can be exploited over the network.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack results in a denial of service by crashing the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote network attacks by authenticated users of the affected database server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must have network access to the MySQL server.
    *   Attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the server.

**Additional Points from the Content**

*   **Commonality:** All three vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-0503, CVE-2016-0504, and CVE-2016-0505) are found in Oracle MySQL and MariaDB with similar attack patterns.
*   **Authentication:** All three require the attacker to have valid user credentials to access the server. This is consistently shown in the CVSS metrics where authentication is 'Single'
*   **Impact:** The most common impact is "Availability Impact: Partial" or "Availability Impact: Complete", indicating the potential to cause a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Specific Components:** Each CVE points to a different component: DML for CVE-2016-0503 and CVE-2016-0504, and Options for CVE-2016-0505.
*   **SUSE and Red Hat:** Both SUSE and Red Hat acknowledge and fix these vulnerabilities in their respective products. Red Hat specifically mentions the vulnerabilities being fixed in `rh-mysql56-mysql`.
*   **openSUSE:** The openSUSE lists also reference fixes for these CVEs.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu also provides updates to address these vulnerabilities.

**Summary of Changes Across Platforms:**

*   **SUSE:** SUSE provides detailed information on affected products, their lifecycle status, and patch versions.
*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat includes these fixes in their software collections (rh-mysql56-mysql) and provides errata and bugzilla information for these CVEs.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu lists the updated versions of MySQL packages that address these CVEs.
