It includes a summary of MS16-016, which addresses CVE-2016-0051. \n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Windows Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client handles specifically crafted input sent to a server. \n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of input by the WebDAV client.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to elevation of privilege, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions.\n- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to be able to log on to the target system and then execute a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally."

It provides the following information:\n\n-   **Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is in `mrxdav.sys`, described in MS16-016, which allows local privilege escalation. It exploits the vulnerability in `mrxdav.sys` described by MS16-016.\n-   **Impact of exploitation:**  The module spawns a process on the target system and elevates its privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` before executing the specified payload within the context of the elevated process.\n-   **Attack vector:** Local privilege escalation.\n-   **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a meterpreter session and must be able to execute the module locally. The target architecture must be x86 and running Windows 7 SP1.\n-   **Additional details:** The module performs reflective DLL injection and uses a C port of the original exploit."
