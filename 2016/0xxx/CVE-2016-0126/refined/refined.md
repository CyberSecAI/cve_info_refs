The provided content is related to CVE-2016-0126.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the way Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This could lead to the attacker gaining control of the affected system, installing programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. This could occur via email (where an attacker convinces a user to open a malicious attachment) or through a web-based attack (where a user is convinced to visit a website hosting a malicious file). The preview pane could also be an attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Microsoft Office file and convince a user to open it. They don't need any special system privileges but can gain administrative rights if the user has such rights.
