{
  "CVE-2016-0834": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies within the Video Decoder driver library `libnvmmlite_video.so` of the NVIDIA OpenMax Component. A value passed from a user to the driver is not correctly validated and is subsequently used as an index to an array.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read/write"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially achieve an escalation of privileges. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local and requires an attacker to be able to supply a malicious input value to the driver.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the device and the ability to send the malformed value to the video decoder driver. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges, but requires a method to interact with the vulnerable driver."
