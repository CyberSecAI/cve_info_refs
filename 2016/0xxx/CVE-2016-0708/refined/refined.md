Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the default Apache Tomcat configuration within specific versions of the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack. When applications are staged using automatic buildpack detection and pass through the Java Buildpack detection script, a misconfiguration allows for serving static content from within the deployed artifact.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is a remote information disclosure. Specifically, sensitive data such as environment variables and bound service details could be exposed.
*   **Misconfigured Default:** The default Apache Tomcat configuration in the affected Java Buildpack versions is vulnerable for some basic web application archive (WAR) packaged applications.
*   **Static Content Serving:** The ability to serve static content from within the deployed application artifact, when combined with the misconfiguration, leads to the exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information, including environment variables, bound service credentials, user-provided service instances details, and developer provided environment variables.
*   **Credential Compromise:** The disclosure of service credentials could lead to the compromise of external services and databases associated with the application, as well as the application itself.
*   **Broader Impact:** The vulnerability could be exploited to gain insight into the application's infrastructure and its configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network through the application.
*   **Static Content Request:** Attackers could make requests to the application, specifically targeting static content to trigger the disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to reach the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Target Application:** While not explicitly mentioned, an attacker would likely need some familiarity with how the application is structured, specifically how it's built and how to request the static content that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Cloud Foundry versions v166 through v227 and Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack versions v2.0 through v3.4 are affected.
*   **Mitigation:** The recommended mitigations include upgrading Cloud Foundry to v228 or later and/or upgrading the Java Buildpack to v3.5.1 or later. Restaging of applications is crucial if only the Java Buildpack is upgraded. Rotation of credentials for applications that used automated buildpack detection is also recommended.
*   **More Detail Than CVE:** The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by specifying the exact configuration flaw, affected components (Tomcat), and includes mitigation guidance.
