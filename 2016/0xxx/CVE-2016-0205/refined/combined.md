## Known Side Effects

**Review the following list of known issues and open defects:**

| Review the [Known errors and limitations](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4KMC_2.4.0.4/com.ibm.sco.doc_2.4/ts/r_known_errors.html) section of the IBM Knowledge Center for issues related to this release. Additional Issues:  * If you do not have any children DS jobs because you did not add any Region Server in your environment, before using the `passwords.sh` script to change the `admin` user password, you must edit the script to change the following line (on one line):   ```   if ! processconfigfiles $job_id "$nodes" "modify" "admin_password" "$pwd" "$obfpwd"   "vmware-discovery.conf" "admin.json" ; then   ```   to the following line (on one line):   ```   if ! processconfigfiles $job_id "$nodes" "modify" "admin_password" "$pwd" "$obfpwd"   "vmware-discovery.conf" "admin.json" "keystonerc" "openrc" ; then   ```   For information about the `passwords.sh` script, see the [Using the IBM Cloud Orchestrator password management tool](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4KMC_2.4.0.4/com.ibm.sco.doc_2.4/installing/c_change_passwordscript.html) topic in the IBM Knowledge Center. * When a local database is used in the Region Server, the `passwords.sh` script does not change the password of the `db2inst1` user in the Region Server. * In an High-Availability topology, after running the `passwords.sh` script to change the `bpm_admin` password, the changes are not reflected correctly in the `soap.client.props` property file on the primary and secondary Central Server 2. When this problem occurs, you might be unable to manage the Business Process Manager component by using System Automation Application Manager. To solve the problem, run the following procedure:   1. Edit the `opt/ibm/BPM/v8.5/profiles/Node1Profile/properties/soap.client.props` file on primary Central Server 2. In the following section:      ```      # - krb5CcacheFile           ( authenticationTarget=KRB5 and loginSource=krb5Ccache, this      #                              optional property can be set to specify a location of the      #                              Kerberos credential cache as an URL. )      ...      # Note: For Microsoft Windows Kerberos native ccache, set the following properties to blank      #               com.ibm.SOAP.krb5CcacheFile=      #               com.ibm.SOAP.loginUserid=      #               com.ibm.SOAP.loginPassword=your_password      #------------------------------------------------------------------------------      ```      remove the password string (**`your_password`**, for example) so that the line is changed to      ```            #               com.ibm.SOAP.loginPassword=            ```   2. Save the file and copy it to the secondary Central Server 2 to overwrite the existing `opt/ibm/BPM/v8.5/profiles/Node1Profile/properties/soap.client.props` file.   3. Stop the System Automation Application Manager automation and restart the primary and secondary Central Server 2.   4. To validate the changes, restart the System Automation Application Manager automation and try to set offline and online the Business Process Manager component on both the primary and secondary Central Server 2. * In the Self-service user interface, the following error message is displayed when an offering is cancelled:   ```   You have been automatically logged out for security reasons. Unfortunately, because of this we are unable    to save your information at this time. Please run this task again to save your information.   ```   You can ignore this message because it does not affect the cancel operation. * If you are using IBM Cloud Orchestrator in a non-English language, the following message might be displayed in English:   ```   CTJCA2100: The operation failed. See the mail report for additional details.   ``` * In the [Using the IBM Cloud Orchestrator password management tool](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4KMC_2.4.0.4/com.ibm.sco.doc_2.4/installing/c_change_passwordscript.html) topic, the following step is not correct and must be removed: "4. Optional: Run the following command to create a backup of the current environment:   ```   ./passwords.sh backup environment   ```   The program downloads or copies the current environment into the `./passwords.sh-backup` directory and then creates an archive file `./passwords.sh-backup-&lttimestamp&gt.tgz`. The actual and modified Deployment Service environment files are located in the `/var/chef/environment` directory." |
