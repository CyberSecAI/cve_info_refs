- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could inject malicious script into a Web page that would be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting website, potentially leading to the theft of the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker could inject malicious script into a web page. The script executes when a victim views the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a web page, requiring some level of access or the ability to manipulate data that is later displayed on the page.
