  "CVE-2016-0706": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CveID": "CVE-2016-0706",
      "Description": "The internal StatusManagerServlet could be loaded by a malicious web application when a security manager was configured. This servlet could then provide the malicious web application with a list of all deployed applications and a list of the HTTP request lines for all requests currently being processed. This could have exposed sensitive information from other web applications, such as session IDs, to the web application."
    },
    "Security_Data": {
      "Root cause": "The StatusManagerServlet was not included in the list of restricted servlets",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Security Manager bypass",
         "Information disclosure"
      ],
      "Impact": "A malicious web application could obtain a list of all deployed applications and a list of the HTTP request lines for all requests currently being processed, possibly exposing sensitive information like session IDs.",
      "Attack vector": "A malicious web application can load the StatusManagerServlet.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to deploy and execute a malicious web application on the vulnerable Tomcat instance, which is running under a Security Manager."
    },
      "Affected_Products": [
        "Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.45",
         "Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.68",
         "Apache Tomcat 8.x before 8.0.31",
        "Apache Tomcat 9.x before 9.0.0.M2"
