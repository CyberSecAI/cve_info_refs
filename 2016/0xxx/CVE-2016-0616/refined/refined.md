Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-0616:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   The vulnerability is described as an "unspecified vulnerability" in Oracle MySQL and MariaDB.
*   It allows "remote authenticated users" to affect the "availability" of the system.
*   The vulnerability is related to the "Optimizer" component in MySQL and MariaDB.
*   The content suggests this is due to a bug in the optimizer, allowing a remote authenticated user to cause a denial of service (DoS).

**2. Affected Software:**

*   **Oracle MySQL:**
    *   Versions 5.5.46 and earlier
    *   Versions 5.6.27 and earlier
    *   Versions 5.7.9 and earlier
*  **MariaDB:**
    *   Versions before 5.5.47
    *   10.0.x before 10.0.23
    *   10.1.x before 10.1.10.

**3. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

* The root cause is a flaw in the 'Optimizer' component of the database software. This suggests a logical error in the code responsible for query optimization, which can be triggered by a specific crafted input.

**4. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

* The vulnerability is present in the query optimizer, where incorrect processing or handling of specific conditions, input or query structures can be exploited to cause a denial of service.

**5. Impact of Exploitation**

*   The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS), meaning the database server could become unresponsive or crash.
*   The attacker can cause a "hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server."

**6. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is "remote," meaning the attacker can exploit this flaw over a network connection.
*   Attack requires an authenticated user, implying that the attacker must have valid database credentials.

**7. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access**: The attacker needs network access to the database server.
*   **Authentication**: The attacker must be able to authenticate to the database server using valid credentials.
*   **Knowledge**: The attacker needs to have some knowledge about how to craft a query to exploit the specific vulnerability in the Optimizer component.

**8. Additional Details From SUSE:**
*  SUSE categorizes this vulnerability as "moderate" in severity.
*  SUSE's CVSS v2 score has it as an AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P, suggesting the attack requires network access with medium complexity with single authentication.
