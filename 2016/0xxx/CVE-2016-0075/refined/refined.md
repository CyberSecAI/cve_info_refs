Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-0075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Windows kernel API that improperly allows a user to access sensitive registry information. Specifically, the `DeviceApi CMApi PiCMOpenDeviceKey` IOCTL allows a user to create arbitrary registry keys.
- The core issue lies in how the `PnpCtxRegCreateTree` function creates registry keys in the user's context via `ZwCreateKey` without enforcing proper access checks. It is intentional that no access check is performed to allow the user to create the key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The kernel API doesn't properly restrict access to sensitive registry information, enabling unauthorized access.
- **Arbitrary Registry Key Creation:** The vulnerability allows a user to create arbitrary registry keys. The `PiCMOpenDeviceKey` IOCTL is used to create keys under `CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles` and if a specific device type flag (0x200) is used, the keys inherit the default security descriptor, giving the creator full control over them.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:**  An attacker can delete the last key in a created path and replace it with a symbolic link to point to an arbitrary key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows a locally authenticated attacker to gain access to information not intended for them, which can ultimately lead to elevated privileges (SYSTEM).
- **Arbitrary Registry Modification:** An attacker can create, modify, and delete registry keys, potentially leading to system instability or further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.
- **DeviceApi IOCTL Abuse:** The exploit leverages a specific IOCTL (`PiCMOpenDeviceKey`) within the `DeviceApi` driver.
- **Registry Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates registry keys through the crafted application, including deleting and creating symbolic links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code (the specially crafted application) on the target machine.
- **Knowledge of IOCTL and Registry Structure:**  Understanding of the `DeviceApi`, the relevant IOCTLs and the Windows Registry structure is required to craft the exploit.
- **No High Integrity Level Required** It is mentioned that the exploit does not work from low-IL due to the restrictions on creating symbolic links from sandboxes.

**Additional Technical Details from Exploit-DB Content:**
- The exploit uses the `PiCMOpenDeviceKey` IOCTL, providing a 3 part path of the form `ABC\DEF\XYZ`. The only criteria for creating this key is it exists as a valid device under `CurrentControlSet\Enum`, however, the keys are created under `CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles`.
- The exploit leverages the fact that if the 0x200 device type flag is set, the default security descriptor (which is CREATOR OWNER full control by default) will be used for the created keys.
- The exploit uses symbolic links to redirect registry writes, which is possible because services are in the same hive, thus not affected by inter-hive symbolic link protections.
- The Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to create a new Image File Execution Options (IFEO) for `wsqmcons.exe`.
