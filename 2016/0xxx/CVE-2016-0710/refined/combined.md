## 2.3.1 Release CVE Reports

### CVE-2016-0709: Code execution via ZIP file path traversal

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.2.0 to 2.2.2 |
|  | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| The unsupported Jetspeed 2.1.x versions may be also affected |
| Mitigation: | 2.2.0 - 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The Import/Export function in the Portal Site Manager, part of the Jetspeed Administrative Portlets, is vulnerable to a path traversal via specially crafted file names in ZIP archives. Any user with permission to upload files via this function can upload a file with a name like "../../../../tmp/foo" to write a file named "foo" in the /tmp directory. This is because the code that performs the unzipping of the archive does not check the validity of the file names before writing them to disk. This can be turned into code execution by uploading a .jsp file and writing it to somewhere on the file system where the web server will execute it when visited

### #CVE-2016-0710: SQL injection in User Manager service

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| Mitigation: | 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The Jetspeed User Manager service, part of the Jetspeed Administrative Portlets, is vulnerable to SQL injection. When performing a search in these tools, the 'user' and 'role' parameters of the request can be injected to alter the logic of the subsequent SQL statement.

There is also an authorization flaw at play here since the above URLs can be reached without being authenticated in Jetspeed.

#### Example

Given this URL:

```
http://192.168.2.4:8080/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/?_type=json&results=10&start=0&sort=userName&dir=asc&name=&roles=foo%27%20
```

The 'role' parameter contains the value "foo" which is not an existing role, but because of the injected SQL code (or '1'='1') the statement returns true anyway and all the existing users are shown.

### CVE-2016-0711: Persistent Cross Site Scripting in links, pages and folders

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.2.0 to 2.2.2 |
|  | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| The unsupported Jetspeed 2.1.x versions may be also affected |
| Mitigation: | 2.2.0 - 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The functionality to add a link, page, or folder, is vulnerable to persistent Cross Site Scripting. This is because it is possible to include HTML tags in the object's name, such as is the example below where a page object is being renamed after creation.

#### Example

Given this AJAX request:

```

POST /jetspeed/services/pagemanagement/info/.psml/_user/andreas/foobar.psml?
_type=json HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.4:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/43.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Referer: http://192.168.2.4:8080/jetspeed/ui/_user/andreas/foobar.psml
Content-Length: 60
Cookie: JSESSIONID=F95E2034A086BE172EF816FF2C853BE9;
JS2TOOLBOX=TAB=theme&CAT=Administration
Connection: close
title=foobar</a></li><script>alert(document.domain)</script>

```

Which results in the following content in the server response:

```

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
<title>foobar</a></li><script>alert(document.domain)</script></title>

```

Note that this code will be executed every time someone visits that space.

### CVE-2016-0712: Reflected Cross Site Scripting in URI path

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.2.0 to 2.2.2 |
|  | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| The unsupported Jetspeed 2.1.x versions may be also affected |
| Mitigation: | 2.2.0 - 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The URI path directory after /portal is vulnerable to reflected Cross Site Scripting. By visiting the following URL, a JavaScript pop-up will appear when the mouse is moved over the minimize/maximize buttons (may differ for different UI versions).
Note this issue is only reproduced on Firefox browser.

#### Example

Given this URL:

```

http://192.168.2.9:8080/jetspeed/portal/foo%22onmouseover%3d%22alert%281%29?URL=foo/bar

```

In the HTML response there is script:

```

<a href="http://192.168.2.4:8080/jetspeed/portal/_ns:..._/foo"onmouseover="alert(1)"
title="Minimize" class="action portlet-action" ><img src="/jetspeed/decorations/images/minimized.gif" alt="Minimize" border="0"/></a>

```

### CVE-2016-2171: Jetspeed User Manager REST service not restricted by Jetspeed Security

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| Mitigation: | 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The Jetspeed User Manager services are vulnerable to unauthorized access. The following APIs are not restricted by Jetspeed Security:

```

                    GET http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/
                    GET http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/{name}/
                    POST http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/{name}/
                    POST http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/
                    DELETE http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/{name}/

```

In the upcoming 2.3.1 release, these URLs are properly secured by Jetspeed Security, requiring Administrative rights.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Apache Jetspeed Arbitrary File Upload

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Apache Jetspeed Arbitrary File Upload

Disclosed
03/06/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits the unsecured User Manager REST API and a ZIP file
path traversal in Apache Jetspeed-2, version 2.3.0 and unknown earlier
versions, to upload and execute a shell.
Note: this exploit will create, use, and then delete a new admin user.
Warning: in testing, exploiting the file upload clobbered the web
interface beyond repair. No workaround has been found yet. Use this
module at your own risk. No check will be implemented.

#### Author(s)

* Andreas Lindh
* wvu <wvu@metasploit.com>

#### Platform

Linux,Windows

#### Architectures

java

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/apache_jetspeed_file_upload.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/apache_jetspeed_file_upload.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/multi/http/apache_jetspeed_file_upload
msf exploit(apache_jetspeed_file_upload) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(apache_jetspeed_file_upload) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(apache_jetspeed_file_upload) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(apache_jetspeed_file_upload) > exploit
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Collect and share all the information you need to conduct a successful and efficient penetration test](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

[Free Metasploit Pro Trial](/try/metasploit-pro/)
[View All Features](/products/metasploit/features/)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

– Jim O’Gorman | President, Offensive Security

#### Description:

The Import/Export function in the Portal Site Manager, part of the Jetspeed Administrative Portlets, is vulnerable to a path traversal via specially crafted file names in ZIP archives. Any user with permission to upload files via this function can upload a file with a name like "../../../../tmp/foo" to write a file named "foo" in the /tmp directory. This is because the code that performs the unzipping of the archive does not check the validity of the file names before writing them to disk. This can be turned into code execution by uploading a .jsp file and writing it to somewhere on the file system where the web server will execute it when visited

### #CVE-2016-0710: SQL injection in User Manager service

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| Mitigation: | 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The Jetspeed User Manager service, part of the Jetspeed Administrative Portlets, is vulnerable to SQL injection. When performing a search in these tools, the 'user' and 'role' parameters of the request can be injected to alter the logic of the subsequent SQL statement.

There is also an authorization flaw at play here since the above URLs can be reached without being authenticated in Jetspeed.

#### Example

Given this URL:

```
http://192.168.2.4:8080/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/?_type=json&results=10&start=0&sort=userName&dir=asc&name=&roles=foo%27%20
```

The 'role' parameter contains the value "foo" which is not an existing role, but because of the injected SQL code (or '1'='1') the statement returns true anyway and all the existing users are shown.

### CVE-2016-0711: Persistent Cross Site Scripting in links, pages and folders

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.2.0 to 2.2.2 |
|  | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| The unsupported Jetspeed 2.1.x versions may be also affected |
| Mitigation: | 2.2.0 - 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The functionality to add a link, page, or folder, is vulnerable to persistent Cross Site Scripting. This is because it is possible to include HTML tags in the object's name, such as is the example below where a page object is being renamed after creation.

#### Example

Given this AJAX request:

```

POST /jetspeed/services/pagemanagement/info/.psml/_user/andreas/foobar.psml?
_type=json HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.4:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/43.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Referer: http://192.168.2.4:8080/jetspeed/ui/_user/andreas/foobar.psml
Content-Length: 60
Cookie: JSESSIONID=F95E2034A086BE172EF816FF2C853BE9;
JS2TOOLBOX=TAB=theme&CAT=Administration
Connection: close
title=foobar</a></li><script>alert(document.domain)</script>

```

Which results in the following content in the server response:

```

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
<title>foobar</a></li><script>alert(document.domain)</script></title>

```

Note that this code will be executed every time someone visits that space.

### CVE-2016-0712: Reflected Cross Site Scripting in URI path

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.2.0 to 2.2.2 |
|  | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| The unsupported Jetspeed 2.1.x versions may be also affected |
| Mitigation: | 2.2.0 - 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The URI path directory after /portal is vulnerable to reflected Cross Site Scripting. By visiting the following URL, a JavaScript pop-up will appear when the mouse is moved over the minimize/maximize buttons (may differ for different UI versions).
Note this issue is only reproduced on Firefox browser.

#### Example

Given this URL:

```

http://192.168.2.9:8080/jetspeed/portal/foo%22onmouseover%3d%22alert%281%29?URL=foo/bar

```

In the HTML response there is script:

```

<a href="http://192.168.2.4:8080/jetspeed/portal/_ns:..._/foo"onmouseover="alert(1)"
title="Minimize" class="action portlet-action" ><img src="/jetspeed/decorations/images/minimized.gif" alt="Minimize" border="0"/></a>

```

### CVE-2016-2171: Jetspeed User Manager REST service not restricted by Jetspeed Security

| Severity: | Important |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor: | The Apache Software Foundation |
| Versions Affected: | Jetspeed 2.3.0 |
| Mitigation: | 2.3.0 users should upgrade to 2.3.1 |
| Credit: | This issue was discovered by ï»¿Andreas Lindh |
| References: | http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html |

#### Description:

The Jetspeed User Manager services are vulnerable to unauthorized access. The following APIs are not restricted by Jetspeed Security:

```

                    GET http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/
                    GET http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/{name}/
                    POST http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/{name}/
                    POST http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/
                    DELETE http://host/jetspeed/services/usermanager/users/{name}/

```

In the upcoming 2.3.1 release, these URLs are properly secured by Jetspeed Security, requiring Administrative rights.
