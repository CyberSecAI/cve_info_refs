- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to Internet Explorer not properly enforcing cross-domain policies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper enforcement of cross-domain policies. This allows an attacker to access information from one domain and inject it into another.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. The vulnerability itself does not allow arbitrary code execution but could be combined with a code execution vulnerability to gain higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Web-based attack: An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    - Compromised websites: Malicious content could be added to compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content.
    - Social engineering: Attackers would need to convince users to click a link and visit the malicious site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a website or inject content into a website and convince the victim to visit the site and interact with the malicious content.
