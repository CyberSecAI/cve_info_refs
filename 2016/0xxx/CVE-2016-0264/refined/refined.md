Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the IBM Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow condition exists within the IBM JVM, making it possible to write beyond the allocated buffer memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially gain control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning that an attacker could exploit this remotely by sending specially crafted data to the JVM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious data to a vulnerable IBM JVM.
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with a high attack complexity.
- No user interaction is required for the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as having a "low" confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact according to the CVSS v3 vector.  However, SUSE rates the impact as critical.
- The content from IBM notes that successful exploitation is possible only "under certain limited circumstances," though no further clarification is provided.
- The issue affects various versions of IBM Java SDK, including version 6, 6R1, 7, 7R1, and 8.
- Fixes are included in specific service refreshes and fix packs of the affected versions.
