- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the application displaying sensitive information within error messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure through error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can obtain sensitive information by examining error messages.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the IBM TRIRIGA application platform and trigger an error that exposes sensitive data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid credentials for the IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform.
