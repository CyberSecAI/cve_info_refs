Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0200:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, specifically when handling linked web resources. This can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. A use-after-free condition is triggered by manipulating a document's elements, causing Internet Explorer to use an array address after the array has been relocated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- Use-after-free vulnerability when managing linked web resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain control of the affected system.
- An attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- They could also add malicious content to compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.
- Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious website, usually via email or instant messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and host a malicious website.
- Ability to convince users to visit the malicious site (e.g., through social engineering, compromised websites, etc).
- No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
