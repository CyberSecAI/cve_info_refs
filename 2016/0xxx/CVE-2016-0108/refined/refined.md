Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability.
- Improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website.
    - The attacker hosts this website and convinces the user to view it via Internet Explorer.
    - Compromised or user-content-hosting websites can also be used by adding the exploit code.
- Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious site, usually through social engineering tactics such as:
    - Enticements in emails or instant messages.
    - Tricking users into opening attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to host a website or inject malicious code into a website visited by the target user.
- The attacker must then convince the target to use Internet Explorer to browse to the malicious content.
- No special privileges are required besides the ability to host the malicious code.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a minimized Proof of Concept (PoC) for triggering the vulnerability.
- The PoC uses a specific style tag that creates a crash.
- It references a Google Security Research issue which may provide further details.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the function `MSHTML!Layout::LayoutBuilderDivider::BuildPageLayout`

**Summary of differences between CVE description and the provided content:**
- The CVE description is a placeholder, while the provided content offers detailed information about affected software, specific vulnerability details, and attack vectors.
- The exploit-db entry provides a PoC.
- The provided content goes further than a basic CVE description by indicating that the issue is a memory corruption bug related to object handling and that the issue exists in the `MSHTML!Layout::LayoutBuilderDivider::BuildPageLayout` function.
