Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0141:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Visual Basic macros within Microsoft Office improperly exporting a user's private key from the certificate store when saving a document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The core issue is that the private key, which is meant to be kept secret, is being inappropriately extracted and potentially exposed during the save process.
- Improper Handling of Private Keys: The Office software, specifically the Visual Basic macro functionality, lacks proper controls over the handling of private keys during document saving.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Private Key Compromise: A successful exploit allows an attacker to potentially gain access to the user's private key.
- Potential for Further Attacks: With the compromised private key, an attacker may impersonate the user or decrypt secure communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Document-Based Attack: An attacker would need to craft or modify a Microsoft Office document that includes a malicious Visual Basic macro.
- Social Engineering: The attacker would have to use social engineering to convince a victim to open the specially crafted document.
- File Exfiltration: After the malicious document is saved, the attacker would need to obtain the saved document containing the exported private key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify Microsoft Office documents with malicious Visual Basic macros.
- Social Engineering skills to trick a victim into opening the document.
- A means of obtaining the saved malicious document containing the private key.
