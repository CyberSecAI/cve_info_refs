Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `UploadFileAction` servlet of Oracle Application Testing Suite (ATS). It stems from insufficient validation of the `fileType` parameter during file uploads. Specifically, by providing `fileType` with a value of `*`, an attacker can bypass intended restrictions and upload files to arbitrary locations on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** Although authentication is required to reach the vulnerable servlet, this can be bypassed using a path traversal technique. Specifically, the exploit leverages the `/olt/Login.do/../../olt/UploadFileUpload.do` URL to bypass authentication.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files to any location on the server due to the lack of proper file type validation.
- **Path Traversal:** The ability to specify an arbitrary directory for the uploaded file to be placed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious JSP file (webshell) to a location within the web application's directory, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server with the privileges of the user running the application (often SYSTEM in Windows environments).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The exploit uses an HTTP POST request with a specially crafted multipart/form-data body to upload the malicious file. The request is sent to the vulnerable `UploadFileUpload.do` endpoint.
- **Modified `fileType` Parameter:** The `fileType` parameter is set to `*` to bypass the file type restrictions.
- **Path Traversal:** An attacker can specify the desired target directory for the uploaded file using the `directory` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Oracle ATS instance.
- **HTTP Communication:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL, parameters and the exploit methodology to perform the attack.
- **(Initial) No Credentials Required:** While the application may require authentication normally, this exploit bypasses this check with the path traversal.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects Oracle Application Testing Suite (OATS) version 12.4.0.2.0 and potentially earlier versions.
- The exploit was demonstrated to achieve a command shell (nt authority\system user in one example) on the targeted server.
- Patches have been released by Oracle to address this vulnerability.

**CVE-2016-0491 Detailed Summary:**

This CVE details an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Oracle Application Testing Suite.  The root cause is improper validation of the `fileType` parameter in the `UploadFileAction` servlet, which can be leveraged along with an authentication bypass to upload malicious files (e.g. jsp webshell) to arbitrary locations allowing for remote code execution.  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the vulnerable application.
