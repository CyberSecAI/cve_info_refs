The provided content references "ESA-2016-047: RSA ArcherÂ® GRC Platform Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability". While this might be related to a CVE, it's not possible to confirm it is CVE-2016-0899 since the CVE description is a PLACEHOLDER. The provided content also lacks the details necessary to make a link between the two.

Therefore, I'll analyze it as if the content is relevant.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive information disclosure in the RSA Archer GRC Platform.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure

**Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive information stored within the RSA Archer GRC Platform.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, since it's a vulnerability in the RSA Archer GRC Platform, it can be assumed that the attacker would need network access to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would need some form of access, either through a network connection or authenticated access (if the vulnerability is in the authentication process itself) to the RSA Archer GRC Platform to exploit this. The specific level of access/authentication required is not specified in the provided text.
