Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-0952

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in the way Adobe Photoshop CC and Bridge CC parse PNG files. Specifically, providing a malformed PNG file with an invalid `uint32` CRC checksum can lead to heap memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is a heap memory corruption vulnerability triggered by malformed PNG files.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate the CRC checksum within PNG files, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:**  An attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the application by exploiting the heap memory corruption.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although the exploit is classified as "dos," the potential for code execution suggests more than a simple denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File-Based:** The attack vector involves opening a specially crafted PNG file within the vulnerable application.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, as the target must open a malicious PNG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need to have local access to the victim's machine.
- **Crafted File:** The attacker needs to create or possess a specifically crafted PNG file with an invalid CRC checksum to trigger the vulnerability.
