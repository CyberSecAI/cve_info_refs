**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The code attempts to use a memory location that has already been deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- System Compromise: If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, modifying or deleting data, or creating new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF Document: The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malformed PDF document.
- User Interaction: User interaction is required as the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote, delivering the exploit via a website or email.
- Ability to create malformed PDF: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF document that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Edge.
- The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in a security update released on March 8, 2016.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a filter (ID '21921').
