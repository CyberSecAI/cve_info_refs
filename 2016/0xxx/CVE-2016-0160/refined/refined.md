Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-0160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Internet Explorer's (specifically MSHTML.DLL) improper validation of input before loading Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files.
*   MSHTML.DLL in Windows 7 SP1 has missing dependencies for certain DLLs (e.g., API-MS-WIN-APPMODEL-RUNTIME-L1-1-0.DLL). When an application using MSHTML.DLL tries to find these missing DLLs, it follows the system's DLL search order.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Planting/Preloading:** The core vulnerability is a DLL planting issue where a malicious DLL, named to match one of the missing dependencies, can be placed in a directory that's part of the DLL search path and loaded by an application using MSHTML.DLL.
*   **Missing Dependencies:** The root cause is that MSHTML.DLL in certain Windows versions (specifically Windows 7 SP1) references DLLs that are not present by default.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Internet Explorer does not properly validate input before loading DLL files, allowing the loading of the malicious DLL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the vulnerable application runs with elevated privileges (e.g., as SYSTEM), an attacker can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
*   **System Control:** An attacker can gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local/Remote File Shares:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL on a network share (e.g., Windows or WebDAV share). If a user opens a document (e.g., Word document) from the share, the malicious DLL will be loaded.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability by hosting a website or exploiting compromised websites that use MSHTML.DLL and tricking users into visiting those websites.
*   **Other Applications Using MSHTML.DLL:** Any application that uses MSHTML.DLL or another DLL which incorporates it is vulnerable, this includes applications like Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint etc.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Placement:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location that is part of the system's DLL search path, usually a location that the user has access to, or a remote file share that the user accesses.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open a document or application that triggers the loading of MSHTML.DLL (or an application using MSHTML.DLL directly or indirectly), thus causing the malicious DLL to be loaded instead of the legit one.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows 7 SP1, it seems that newer versions of windows are not affected by this missing dependency issue.
*   Microsoft addressed the vulnerability in security update MS16-037. It's also noted that MS16-041 is required to fully fix the issue.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed before a patch was released.
*   EMET may help mitigate this vulnerability if properly configured.
