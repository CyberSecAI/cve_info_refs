{
  "CVE-2016-0703": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The s2_srvr.c code in OpenSSL did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers, leading to clear key bytes displacing encrypted key bytes",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper enforcement of clear-key length",
      "Divide-and-conquer key recovery attack",
      "More efficient DROWN attack"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery of SSLv2 master key with 16 connections and negligible computation, and more efficient DROWN attack against non-export ciphersuites without significant computation",
    "Attack vectors": "Eavesdropping on SSLv2 handshake, using the vulnerable server as an oracle to recover the master key",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Eavesdropper with network access to the vulnerable server."
