OpenSSL Security Advisory [1st March 2016]
=========================================
NOTE: With this update, OpenSSL is disabling the SSLv2 protocol by default, as
well as removing SSLv2 EXPORT ciphers. We strongly advise against the use of
SSLv2 due not only to the issues described below, but to the other known
deficiencies in the protocol as described at
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176
Cross-protocol attack on TLS using SSLv2 (DROWN) (CVE-2016-0800)
================================================================
Severity: High
A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS
sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a
Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and
non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting
SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or
POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is
known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800).
Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50
computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more
efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers
using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on
19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below).
Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS
servers, if they've not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also
sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and
1.0.2f) have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol,
and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2
ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of
SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers.
OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN:
SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time. Builds that are not configured
with "enable-ssl2" will not support SSLv2. Even if "enable-ssl2" is used,
users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23\_method() will
need to explicitly call either of:
SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options(ctx, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2);
or
SSL\_clear\_options(ssl, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2);
as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly
uses the version-specific SSLv2\_method() or its client or server variants,
SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed.
Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no
longer available.
In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of
OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured with "enable-weak-ssl-ciphers" will
not provide any "EXPORT" or "LOW" strength ciphers.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on December 29th 2015 by Nimrod Aviram and
Sebastian Schinzel. The fix was developed by Viktor Dukhovni and Matt Caswell
of OpenSSL.
Double-free in DSA code (CVE-2016-0705)
=======================================
Severity: Low
A double free bug was discovered when OpenSSL parses malformed DSA private keys
and could lead to a DoS attack or memory corruption for applications that
receive DSA private keys from untrusted sources. This scenario is considered
rare.
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on February 7th 2016 by Adam Langley
(Google/BoringSSL) using libFuzzer. The fix was developed by Dr Stephen Henson
of OpenSSL.
Memory leak in SRP database lookups (CVE-2016-0798)
===================================================
Severity: Low
The SRP user database lookup method SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user had
confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly
allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of
distinguishing these two cases.
Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid
login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker
connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around
300 bytes per connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or
configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable.
In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed.
To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user is now disabled even if the user has configured
a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to
SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong
guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid
logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in
constant time.
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s
This issue was discovered on February 23rd 2016 by Emilia KÃ¤sper of
the OpenSSL development team. Emilia KÃ¤sper also developed the fix.
BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn NULL pointer deref/heap corruption (CVE-2016-0797)
======================================================================
Severity: Low
In the BN\_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int
value |i|. Later |bn\_expand| is called with a value of |i \* 4|. For large values
of |i| this can result in |bn\_expand| not allocating any memory because |i \* 4|
is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a
subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i \* 4|
could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to
the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap
corruption. A similar issue exists in BN\_dec2bn. This could have security
consequences if BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with
very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence.
All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to
be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If
user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data
then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is
also anticipated to be rare.
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on February 19th 2016 by Guido Vranken. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Fix memory issues in BIO\_\*printf functions (CVE-2016-0799)
==========================================================
Severity: Low
The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a "%s" format string in the
BIO\_\*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string
and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings.
Additionally the internal |doapr\_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB
memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory
allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a
buffer to be allocated is greater than INT\_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing
a very long "%s" format string. Memory leaks can also occur.
The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour.
These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this
way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when
printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that
print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources.
OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out
ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments.
Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc
received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to
trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on February 23rd by Guido Vranken. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Side channel attack on modular exponentiation (CVE-2016-0702)
=============================================================
Severity: Low
A side-channel attack was found which makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the
Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture which could lead to the recovery of RSA
keys. The ability to exploit this issue is limited as it relies on an attacker
who has control of code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as
the victim thread which is performing decryptions.
This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on Jan 8th 2016 by Yuval Yarom, The
University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin, Technion and Tel Aviv
University, and Nadia Heninger, University of Pennsylvania with more
information at http://cachebleed.info. The fix was developed by Andy Polyakov
of OpenSSL.
Divide-and-conquer session key recovery in SSLv2 (CVE-2016-0703)
================================================================
Severity: High
This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which
time the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293.
s2\_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If
clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they \*displace\* encrypted-key
bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an
eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an
oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the
server and negligible computation.
More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is
effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant
computation.
This issue affected OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.0.1l, 1.0.0q, 0.9.8ze and all
earlier versions. It was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf
(released March 19th 2015).
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on February 10th 2016 by David Adrian and J.
Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan. The underlying defect had by
then already been fixed by Emilia KÃ¤sper of OpenSSL on March 4th 2015. The fix
for this issue can be identified by commits ae50d827 (1.0.2a), cd56a08d
(1.0.1m), 1a08063 (1.0.0r) and 65c588c (0.9.8zf).
Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2 (CVE-2016-0704)
==============================================
Severity: Moderate
This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which
time the code was refactored to address the vulnerability CVE-2015-0293.
s2\_srvr.c overwrite the wrong bytes in the master-key when applying
Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites. This provides a
Bleichenbacher oracle, and could potentially allow more efficient variants of
the DROWN attack.
This issue affected OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.0.1l, 1.0.0q, 0.9.8ze and all
earlier versions. It was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf
(released March 19th 2015).
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on February 10th 2016 by David Adrian and J.
Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan. The underlying defect had by
then already been fixed by Emilia KÃ¤sper of OpenSSL on March 4th 2015. The fix

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

CWE-119,CWE-200,CWE-310,CWE-399    Email      Summary  * On March 1, 2016, the OpenSSL Software Foundation released a security advisory detailing seven vulnerabilities and a new attack, referred to as the *Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN)* attack. A total of eight Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were assigned. Of the eight CVEs, three relate to the DROWN attack. The remaining CVEs track low severity vulnerabilities.      DROWN is a cross-protocol attack that actively exploits weaknesses in SSL Version 2 (SSLv2) to decrypt passively collected Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions. DROWN does not exploit a vulnerability in the TLS protocol or any specific implementation of the protocol.      To execute a successful DROWN attack, the attacker must identify a server that supports both SSLv2 and TLS, and uses the same RSA key pair for both protocols. The attacker must also be able to collect TLS traffic for the server.         This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.         This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160302-openssl>  Affected Products  * Cisco is currently investigating its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities and the impact on each affected product. As the investigation progresses, this document will be updated to include Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs will be accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID) and will contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software versions.         The following products are under active investigation to determine whether they are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.   **Products Under Investigation***Unified Computing*   + Cisco UCS Invicta Series Solid State Systems   *Cisco Hosted Services*   + Cisco UCS Invicta Series Autosupport Portal   Vulnerable ProductsThe following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or more vulnerabilities described in this advisory.      **Important:** In the following table, an asterisk (\*) after the product name indicates a Cisco product that is vulnerable to the DROWN attack. At the time of this publication, 25 Cisco products are known to be vulnerable to the DROWN attack.      | Product | Cisco Bug ID | Fixed Release Availability |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Collaboration

Agent Manager (LCM)  Details  * The names and associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs for the vulnerabilities that were disclosed on March 1, 2016, in the OpenSSL Software Foundation security advisory are as follows.      **Multiple Vendor SSL/TLS Implementation DROWN Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in multiple vendor products using SSL/TLS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN) cross-protocol attack and gain access to sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to an implementation error in the SSLv2 protocol that could allow the use of weak Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) cipher suites within Transport Layer Security (TLS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting traffic between a targeted system and a vulnerable SSLv2 server that uses the same private key to observe and possibly decrypt one of the connections. The attacker could return the decrypted ciphertext to the targeted server and, judging by the server's responses, determine the secret keys used within the encrypted communication. An exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt the TLS session between the targeted client and SSLv2 server, which the attacker could leverage to gain access to sensitive information.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0800      **OpenSSL Bleichenbacher Protection Security Bypass Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the SSLv2 protocol implementation in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security restrictions.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to establish a Bleichenbacher oracle, which could aid at conducting more variants of the Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN) attack.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0704      **OpenSSL SSLv2 master-key Recovery Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper security restrictions implemented by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting the communication traffic. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0703      **OpenSSL Digital Signature Algorithm Private Key Processing Double Free Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) private keys by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an application that uses a vulnerable version of OpenSSL to connect to an attacker-controlled server in an attempt to exchange malformed DSA private keys with the application. An exploit could cause a double free memory corruption condition that the attacker could leverage to cause a DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0705      **OpenSSL SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user Method Memory Leak Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper memory handling. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious login requests to the SRP user database. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak on the affected system, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0798      **OpenSSL BN\_hex2bn and BN\_dec2bn Functions NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper memory operations performed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted input to be processed by the affected software. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the application to stop intermittently, leading to a DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0797      **OpenSSL BIO\_\*printf Functions Out of Bounds Memory Read Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper bounds-checks performed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted input to be processed by the affected software. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0799 and CVE-2016-2842      **OpenSSL RSA Cryptographic Key Recovery Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to gain access to sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper memory management performed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a malicious code in the affected software. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information on a targeted system.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-0702  Workarounds  * Any workarounds will be documented in the Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6109

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display,
a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate
the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional ﬁles being transferred. This
affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6110

In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 7 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for compat-openssl098 fixes various security issues and bugs:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files
or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
Also fixes the following bug:
- Avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading
and also fixes a memory leak in libssl. (bsc#952871)
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:

# The DROWN Attack

* [Paper](#paper)
* [Q&A](#question-answer)

DROWN is a serious vulnerability that affects HTTPS and
other services that rely on SSL and TLS, some of the essential
cryptographic protocols for Internet security. These protocols
allow everyone on the Internet to browse the web, use email,
shop online, and send instant messages without third-parties
being able to read the communication.

DROWN allows attackers to break the encryption and read or
steal sensitive communications, including passwords, credit
card numbers, trade secrets, or financial data. At the time of
public disclosure on March 2016, our
measurements indicated 33% of all HTTPS servers were
vulnerable to the attack.
Fortunately, the vulnerability is much less prevalent now.
As of 2019, SSL Labs estimates that 1.2% of HTTPS servers are
vulnerable.

### What can the attackers gain?

Any communication between users and the server. This
typically includes, but is not limited to, usernames and
passwords, credit card numbers, emails, instant messages, and
sensitive documents. Under some common scenarios, an attacker
can also impersonate a secure website and intercept or change
the content the user sees.

### Who is vulnerable?

Websites, mail servers, and other TLS-dependent services
are at risk for the DROWN attack.
At the time of public disclosure,
[many popular sites](/top-sites.html) were
affected. We used Internet-wide scanning to measure how many
sites are vulnerable:

Operators of vulnerable servers need to take action. There
is nothing practical that browsers or end-users can do on
their own to protect against this attack.

### Is my site vulnerable?

Modern servers and clients use the TLS encryption protocol.
However, due to misconfigurations, many servers also still
support SSLv2, a 1990s-era predecessor to TLS. This support
did not matter in practice, since no up-to-date clients
actually use SSLv2. Therefore, even though SSLv2 is known to
be badly insecure, until now, merely supporting SSLv2 was not
considered a security problem, because clients never used
it.

DROWN shows that merely supporting SSLv2 is a threat to
modern servers and clients. It allows an attacker to decrypt
modern TLS connections between up-to-date clients and servers
by sending probes to a server that supports SSLv2 and uses the
same private key.

![](media/img/DROWN_diagram1.jpg)

A server is vulnerable to DROWN if:

* It allows SSLv2 connections. This is surprisingly
  common, due to misconfiguration and inappropriate default
  settings.

**or:**

* Its private key is used on *any other server* that
  allows SSLv2 connections, even for another protocol. Many
  companies reuse the same certificate and key on their web
  and email servers, for instance. In this case, if the email
  server supports SSLv2 and the web server does not, an
  attacker can take advantage of the email server to break TLS
  connections to the web server.

### How do I protect my server?

To protect against DROWN, server
operators need to ensure that their private keys are not used
anywhere with server software that allows SSLv2 connections.
This includes web servers, SMTP servers, IMAP and POP servers,
and any other software that supports SSL/TLS.

Disabling SSLv2 can be complicated and depends on the
specific server software. We provide instructions here for
several common products:

**OpenSSL:** OpenSSL is a cryptographic library used in
many server products. For users of OpenSSL, the easiest and
recommended solution is to upgrade to a recent OpenSSL
version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g.
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s. Users of older
OpenSSL versions should upgrade to either one of these
versions. More details can be found
in [this
OpenSSL blog post](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/03/01/an-openssl-users-guide-to-drown/).

**(Updated March 13th, 16:00 UTC)
Microsoft IIS (Windows Server):**
Support for SSLv2 on the server side is enabled by default
only on the OS versions that correspond to IIS 7.0 and IIS 7.5,
namely Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows
Server 2008R2. This support can be disabled in the appropriate
SSLv2 subkey for 'Server', as outlined in
[KB245030](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/245030/EN-US).
Even if users have not taken the steps to disable SSLv2,
the export-grade and 56-bit ciphers that make DROWN feasible
are not supported by default.

**Network Security Services (NSS):** NSS is a common
cryptographic library built into many server products. NSS
versions 3.13 (released back in 2012) and above should have SSLv2 disabled by
default. (A small number of users may have enabled SSLv2
manually and will need to take steps to disable it.) Users of
older versions should upgrade to a more recent version. We
still recommend checking whether your private key is exposed
elsewhere

**Other affected software and operating systems:**

**Browsers and other clients:** There is nothing
practical that web browsers or other client software can do to
prevent DROWN. Only server operators are able to take action
to protect against the attack.

#### What does DROWN stand for?

DROWN stands for **D**ecrypting **R**SA with **O**bsolete and **W**eakened e**N**cryption.

#### What are the technical details?

For the complete details, see
our [full technical
paper](/drown-attack-paper.pdf). We also provide a brief technical summary
below:

In technical terms, DROWN is a new form of cross-protocol
[Bleichenbacher
padding oracle attack](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12688/can-you-explain-bleichenbachers-cca-attack-on-pkcs1-v1-5). It allows an attacker to decrypt
intercepted TLS connections by making specially crafted
connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same private
key.

The attacker begins by observing roughly several hundred connections
between the victim client and server. The attacker will
eventually be able to decrypt one of them. Collecting this
many connections might involve intercepting traffic for a long
time or tricking the user into visiting a website that quickly
makes many connections to another site in the background. The
connections can use any version of the SSL/TLS protocol,
including TLS 1.2, so long as they employ the commonly used
RSA key exchange method. In an RSA key exchange, the client
picks a random session key and sends it to the server,
encrypted using RSA and the server’s public key.

Next, the attacker repeatedly connects to the SSLv2 server
and sends specially crafted handshake messages with
modifications to the RSA ciphertext from the victim’s
connections. (This is possible because
[unpadded
RSA is *malleable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Unpadded_RSA).) The way the server responds to
each of these probes depends on whether the modified
ciphertext decrypts to a plaintext message with the right
form. Since the attacker doesn’t know the server’s private
key, he doesn’t know exactly what the plaintext will be, but
the way that the server responds ends up leaking information
to the attacker about the secret keys used for the victim’s
TLS connections.

The way this information is leaked can take two forms:

* In the most general variant of DROWN, the attack
  exploits a fundamental weakness in the SSLv2 protocol that
  relates to export-grade cryptography that was introduced to
  comply with 1990s-era U.S. government restrictions. The
  attacker’s probes use a cipher that involves only 40 bits of
  RSA encrypted secret key material. The attacker can tell
  whether his modified ciphertext was validly formed by
  comparing the server’s response to all 240
  possibilities—a moderately large computation, but one
  that we show can be inexpensively performed with
  GPUs. Overall, roughly 40,000 probe connections and
  250 computation is needed to decrypt one out of 900 TLS
  connections from the victim.
  Running the computations for the full attack
  on Amazon EC2 costs about $440.
* A majority of servers vulnerable to DROWN are also
  affected by an OpenSSL bug that results in a significantly
  cheaper version of the attack. In this special case, the
  attacker can craft his probe messages so that he immediately
  learns whether they had the right form without any large
  computation. In this case, the attacker needs about 17,000
  probe connections in total to obtain the key for one out of 260 TLS
  connections from the victim,
  and the computation takes under a minute on a
  fast PC.

This special case stems from the complexity introduced by
export-grade cryptography. The OpenSSL bug allows the
attacker to mix export-grade and non-export-grade crypto
parameters in order to exploit unexpected paths in the
code.

This form of the attack is fast enough to allow an online
man-in-the-middle (MitM) style of attack, where the attacker
can impersonate a vulnerable server to the victim client.
Among other advantages, such an attacker can force the
client and server to use RSA key exchange (and can then
decrypt the connection) even if they would normally prefer a
different cipher. This lets the attacker target and break
connections between modern browsers and servers that prefer
perfect-forward-secret key exchange methods, such as DHE and
ECDH.

We were able to execute this form of the attack in under
a minute on a single PC.

#### Is there a CVE for DROWN?

Yes. The DROWN attack itself was
assigned [CVE-2016-0800](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160301.txt).

DROWN is made worse by two additional OpenSSL
implementation vulnerabilities. [CVE-2015-3197](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160128.txt),
which affected OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.2f and 1.0.1r,
allows a DROWN attacker to connect to the server with disabled
SSLv2 ciphersuites, provided that support for SSLv2 itself is
enabled. [CVE-2016-0703](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160301.txt), which affected OpenSSL
versions prior to 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r, and 0.9.8zf, greatly
reduces the time and cost of carrying out the DROWN
attack.

#### How easy is it to carry out the attack? Is it practical?

Yes. We’ve been able to execute the attack against OpenSSL
versions that are vulnerable to CVE-2016-0703 in under a
minute using a single PC. Even for servers that don’t
have these particular bugs, the general variant of the attack,
which works against any SSLv2 server, can be conducted in
under 8 hours at a total cost of $440.

#### What popular sites are affected?

[Here are some examples](/top-sites.html).
#### Is the vulnerability currently being exploited by attackers?

We have no reason to believe that DROWN has been exploited
in the wild prior to this disclosure. Since the details of the
vulnerability are now public, attackers may start exploiting
it at any time, and we recommend taking the
countermeasures [explained above](#mitigation) as
soon as possible.

#### SSLv2 has been known to be insecure for 20 years. What’s the big deal?

Indeed, SSLv2 has long known to be weak when clients and
servers use it to communicate, and so nearly every modern
client uses a more recent protocol. DROWN shows
that *merely allowing SSLv2*, even if no legitimate
clients ever use it, is a threat to modern servers and
clients. It allows an attacker to *decrypt modern TLS
connections* between up-to-date clients and servers by
sending probes to any server that supports SSLv2 using the
same private key.

#### Does DROWN allow an attacker to steal the server’s private key?

No. DROWN allows an attacker to decrypt one connection at a
time. The attacker does not learn the server’s private
key.

#### Can DROWN be also used to perform MitM attacks?

Yes. Some variants of the attack can be used to perform
MitM attacks against TLS or QUIC. More details can be found in
sections 5.3 and 7 of
the [technical paper](/drown-attack-paper.pdf).

#### Does Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) prevent DROWN?

Surprisingly, no. The active MitM form of the attack allows an
attacker to target servers and clients that prefer non-RSA key
exchange methods. See sections 5.3 and 7 of
the [technical paper](/drown-attack-paper.pdf).

#### Do I need to get a new certificate for my server?

Probably not. As the attacker does not learn the server’s
private key, there’s no need to obtain new certificates. The
only action required is disabling SSLv2 as per
the [countermeasures explained
above](#mitigation). If you cannot confidently determine that SSLv2 is
disabled on every device or server that uses your server’s
private key, you should generate a fresh key for the server
and obtain a new certificate.

#### Do I need to update my browser?

No. There is nothing practical that web browsers or other
client software can do to prevent DROWN. Only server operators
are able to take action to protect against the attack.

#### I have a firewall that allows filtering of SSLv2 traffic. Should I filter that traffic?

Yes, that’s a reasonable precaution, although it will also
prevent our scanners from being able to
help you identify vulnerable servers. You might consider first
running the test suite to identify vulnerable servers and only
then filtering SSLv2 traffic. You should also use
the [countermeasures explained
above](#mitigation).

#### Can I detect if someone has exploited this against me?

Possibly. If you run a server and can be certain no one
made a large number of SSLv2 connections to any of your
servers (for example, by examining IDS or server logs), then
you weren’t attacked. Your logs may contain a small number of
SSLv2 connections from the Internet-wide scans that we
conducted over the past few months to measure the prevalence
of the vulnerability.

#### My HTTPS server is certified PCI compliant, so I already know I have SSLv2 disabled. Do I still need to take action?

Yes. Even if you’re certain that you have SSLv2 disabled on
your HTTPS server, you may be reusing your private key on
another server (such as an email server) that does support
SSLv2. We recommend manually inspecting all servers that use
your private key.

#### I have an old embedded device that doesn’t allow me to disable SSLv2, and I have to keep it running. What do I do?

Security against DROWN is not possible for that embedded
device. If you must keep that device running, make sure it
uses a different RSA private key than any other servers and
devices. You can also limit the scope of attack by using a
firewall to filter SSLv2 traffic from outside your
organization. In all circumstances, maintaining support for
SSLv2 should be a last resort.

#### SSLLabs says I have SSLv2 disabled. That means I’m safe, right?

Unfortunately, no. Although [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
provides an invaluable suite of security tests, right now it
only checks whether your HTTPS server directly allows SSLv2.
You’re just as much at risk if your site’s certificate or key
is used anywhere else on a server that does support SSLv2.
Common examples include SMTP, IMAP, and POP mail servers, and
secondary HTTPS servers used for specific web
applications.

You can also download and run our
[scanner utility](https://github.com/nimia/public_drown_scanner).
This utility only detects SSLv2
support *on a single port*. It *cannot detect the common
scenario*, explained above, where a web server that doesn't
support SSLv2 is vulnerable because it shares its public key with
an email server that does.

#### Why does your tool say I support SSLv2, but nmap says I don't?

Due to CVE-2015-3197, OpenSSL may still accept
SSLv2 connections even if all SSLv2 ciphers are disabled.

#### Are you planning to release the code for your implementation of the attack?

Not in the immediate future. There are still too many
servers vulnerable to the attack.

#### What factors contributed to DROWN?

For the third time in a year, a major Internet security
vulnerability has resulted from
[the way cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States)
 [was weakened](http://privacyink.org/pdf/export_control.pdf)
by U.S. government policies that
restricted exporting strong cryptography until the late
1990s. Although these restrictions, evidently designed to make
it easier for NSA to decrypt the communication of people
abroad, were relaxed nearly 20 years ago, the weakened
cryptography remains in the protocol specifications and
continues to be supported by many servers today, adding
complexity—and the potential for catastrophic
failure—to some of the Internet’s most important
security features.

The U.S. government deliberately weakened three kinds of
cryptographic primitives: RSA encryption, Diffie-Hellman key
exchange, and symmetric
ciphers. [FREAK](https://mitls.org/pages/attacks/SMACK#freak)
exploited export-grade RSA,
and [Logjam](https://weakdh.org) exploited
export-grade Diffie-Hellman. Now, DROWN exploits export-grade
symmetric ciphers, demonstrating that all three kinds of
deliberately weakened crypto have come to put the security of
the Internet at risk decades later.

Today, some policy makers are calling for new
[restrictions on the design of cryptography](http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/97690)
in order to
prevent law enforcement from “going dark.” While
we believe that advocates of such backdoors are acting out of
a good faith desire to protect their countries, history’s
technical lesson is clear: weakening cryptography carries
enormous risk to all of our security.

## Security Advisory 0018 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1260-security-advisory-18?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** March 1st, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | March 1st, 2016 | Initial release. Issue under investigation. |
| 1.1 | March 7th, 2016 | Updated to include assessment |

**Arista Products vulnerability report for security vulnerabilities released by OpenSSL on March 1st, 2016**

Arista’s software products EOS and CloudVision Portal are **not vulnerable** to the following issues, as all features that offer an SSL server have the SSLv2 protocol explicitly disabled:

* Double-free in DSA code (CVE-2016-0705)
* Memory leak in SRP database lookups (CVE-2016-0798)
* BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn NULL pointer deref/heap corruption (CVE-2016-0797)
* Fix memory issues in BIO\_\*printf functions (CVE-2016-0799)
* Side channel attack on modular exponentiation (CVE-2016-0702)
* Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2 (CVE-2016-0704)
* Cross-protocol attack on TLS using SSLv2 (DROWN) (CVE-2016-0800)
* Divide-and-conquer session key recovery in SSLv2 (CVE-2016-0703)

CloudVision eXchange is affected only by the following two vulnerabilities:

**NOTE:** CloudVision eXchange (CVX) is deployed as a virtual appliance and runs an EOS image. Therefore only CVX features leveraging SSLv2 in the EOS releases are vulnerable.

* Cross-protocol attack on TLS using SSLv2 (DROWN) (CVE-2016-0800)
* Divide-and-conquer session key recovery in SSLv2 (CVE-2016-0703)

| Product | CloudVision eXchange |
| --- | --- |
| Software versions | 4.15.0F  * 4.15.0FX * 4.15.0FXA * 4.15.0FX1  4.15.1F  * 4.15.1FXB.1 * 4.15.1FXB * 4.15.1FX-7060X * 4.15.1FX-7260QX  4.15.2F 4.15.3F  * 4.15.3FX-7050X-72Q * 4.15.3FX-7060X.1 * 4.15.3FX-7500E3 * 4.15.3FX-7500E3.3  4.15.4F  * 4.15.4FX-7500E3 |
| Status | Affected |
| Resolution | This is tracked by bug 145982 and the fix will be available in EOS releases 4.15.5M. Recommendation is to upgrade CVX instances to the remediated EOS version when available. |

**Details:** SSL profiles are used by CloudVision eXchange (CVX) to encrypt Out-of-Band (OOB) communication which is supported starting EOS-4.15.0F. SSL profiles for Out-Of-Band communication in CVX is used for the following activities between the switch (client) and CVX (server):

* Heartbeat exchange between the CVX clients running on switches and CVX

CVX is vulnerable to CVE-2015-3197 (SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers) as it does not disable the SSLv2 protocol, which allows clients to force SSLv2 connections leading to the DROWN attack. In addition to decrypting the CVX OOB connection, this attack could also allow eAPI traffic from CVX to be decrypted if both eAPI and CVX share the same SSL private key, even across different switches.

To verify if the CVX instance is using the same SSL private key for OOB and eAPI, check the output of the following commands to see if they are using the same SSL profile. In the following outputs the name of the SSL profile is ‘server-ssl’ and both commands indicate that the same SSL profile is being used therefore sharing the same certificate and key:

```
cvx#show cvx
CVX Server
 Status: Enabled
 UUID: beb19142-dfaa-11e4-b996-001c73105347
 Heartbeat interval: 20.0
 Heartbeat timeout: 60.0
 SSL profile: server-ssl
    Status: Enabled
```
```
cvx#show management api http-commands
Enabled:            Yes
HTTPS server:       running, set to use port 443
HTTP server:        shutdown, set to use port 80
Local HTTP server:  shutdown, no authentication, set to use port 8080
Unix Socket server: shutdown, no authentication
VRF:                default
Hits:               0
Last hit:           never
Bytes in:           0
Bytes out:          0
Requests:           0
Commands:           0
Duration:           0.000 seconds
SSL Profile:        server-ssl
QoS DSCP:           0
URLs
```

**Mitigation to protect eAPI traffic from being decrypted:** If eAPI is enabled on the CVX instance, it is recommended to configure the two features to use different SSL profiles which in turn use different certificate and keys to protect eAPI traffic from being decrypted. The following options are available to protect eAPI traffic from being decrypted:

* Configure eAPI to use a separate certificate/key by creating a new SSL profile with a new certificate/key

**OR**

* Configure CVX OOB communication to use a separate certificate/key by creating a new SSL profile with a new certificate/key

**Instructions to setup a new SSL profile for eAPI**

To configure eAPI to use a new HTTPS certificate, follow these instructions using a different SSL certificate from the one used for CVX. Ensure that a new PEM encoded server certificate and RSA key files are available to copy to the switch:

```
myswitch> enable
myswitch# copy scp:This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..1.1/path-to-certificate/file-name certificate:eapiServerCert
myswitch# copy scp:This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..1.1/path-to-key/file-name sslkey:eapiServerKey
myswitch# configure terminal
myswitch(config)# management security
myswitch(config-mgmt-security)# ssl profile eapi
myswitch(config-mgmt-sec-ssl-profile-eapi)# certificate eapiServerCert key eapiServerKey
myswitch(config-mgmt-sec-ssl-profile-eapi)# management api http-commands
myswitch(config-mgmt-api-http-cmds)# protocol https ssl profile eapi
myswitch(config-mgmt-api-http-cmds)# show management api http-commands https certificate
   Certificate:
   ...

   Private Key:
   …

```

These instructions can also be viewed in the documentation for eAPI available on the switch - https://<switch-hostname/IP>/overview.html

**Instructions to setup a new SSL profile for CVX**

To configure a separate SSL profile on CVX for OOB using the following commands:

On the CVX server, copy the server certificate and key and also the CA certificate to verify CVX clients.

```
cvx(config)#!Copy the PEM encoded certificate and RSA key files for CVX server.
cvx(config)#!Lets call them server.crt and server.key
cvx(config)#copy url certificate:server.crt
cvx(config)#copy url sslkey:server.key
cvx(config)#!Copy the PEM encoded CA certificate to verify the certificate of CVX clients.Lets call it ca.crt
cvx(config)#copy url certificate:ca.crt
```

On the CVX server, configure SSL profile with the certificates and key as below.

```
cvx(config)#management security
cvx(config-mgmt-security)#ssl profile cvx
cvx(config-mgmt-sec-ssl-profile-serverssl)#certificate server.crt key server.key
cvx(config-mgmt-sec-ssl-profile-serverssl)#trust certificate ca.crt
```

An update that solves 7 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for openssl fixes various security issues and bugs:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files
or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
Also fixes the following bug:
- Avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading
and also fixes a memory leak in libssl. (bsc#952871 bsc#967787)

and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files
or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.

An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for openssl fixes various security issues:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050) Various changes
in the modular exponentation code were added that make sure that it is
not possible to recover RSA secret keys by analyzing cache-bank
conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
thread performing decryptions.
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files or application command line arguments. If
user developed applications generated config file data based on
untrusted data, then this could have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265) The SRP user database lookup method
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() had a memory leak that attackers could abuse to
facility DoS attacks. To mitigate the issue, the seed handling in
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() was disabled even if the user has configured a
seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user().
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
Also the following bug was fixed:
- Ensure that OpenSSL doesn't fall back to the default digest algorithm
(SHA1) in case a non-FIPS algorithm was negotiated while running in FIPS
mode. Instead, OpenSSL will refuse the session. (bnc#958501)
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP1:Update update project.

An update that fixes 7 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for compat-openssl098 fixes various security issues and bugs:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files
or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
Also fixes the following bug:
- Avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading
and also fixes a memory leak in libssl. (bsc#952871)
Patch Instructions:
To install this SUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.

An update that fixes 11 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for openssl fixes various security issues:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050) Various changes
in the modular exponentation code were added that make sure that it is
not possible to recover RSA secret keys by analyzing cache-bank
conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
thread performing decryptions.
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files or application command line arguments. If
user developed applications generated config file data based on
untrusted data, then this could have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265) The SRP user database lookup method
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() had a memory leak that attackers could abuse to
facility DoS attacks. To mitigate the issue, the seed handling in
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() was disabled even if the user has configured a
seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user().
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
Older issues fixed:
- CVE-2015-1794 follow-up to CVE-2015-1794 (the CVE bug as such doesn't
affect 1.0.1 but use these patches to prevent potential attacks
- CVE-2015-3195 fix leak with ASN.1 combine (bsc#957812)
- CVE-2015-3194 add PSS parameter check (bsc#957815)
- CVE-2015-3197 better SSLv2 cipher-suite enforcement (bsc#963415)

An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for openssl fixes various security issues and bugs:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050) Various changes
in the modular exponentation code were added that make sure that it is
not possible to recover RSA secret keys by analyzing cache-bank
conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
thread performing decryptions.
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files
or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265) The SRP user database lookup method
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() had a memory leak that attackers could abuse to
facility DoS attacks. To mitigate the issue, the seed handling in
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() was disabled even if the user has configured a
seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user().
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
Bugs fixed:
- Avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading.
(bsc#952871)
- Ensure that OpenSSL doesn't fall back to the default digest algorithm
(SHA1) in case a non-FIPS algorithm was negotiated while running in FIPS
mode. Instead, OpenSSL will refuse the digest. (bnc#958501)

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for openssl
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2016:0638-1
Rating: important
References:
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be installed.
Description:
This update for openssl fixes various security issues:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050) Various changes
in the modular exponentation code were added that make sure that it is
not possible to recover RSA secret keys by analyzing cache-bank
conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
thread performing decryptions.
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files or application command line arguments. If
user developed applications generated config file data based on
untrusted data, then this could have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265) The SRP user database lookup method
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() had a memory leak that attackers could abuse to
facility DoS attacks. To mitigate the issue, the seed handling in
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() was disabled even if the user has configured a
seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user().
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-0702.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-0704.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-0703 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0703)

#### Description

The get\_client\_master\_key function in s2\_srvr.c in the SSLv2 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a accepts a nonzero CLIENT-MASTER-KEY CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an arbitrary cipher, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to determine the MASTER-KEY value and decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, a related issue to CVE-2016-0800.

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the worst
allowing remote attackers to decrypt TLS sessions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.2g-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.2g-r2** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, the worst
being a cross-protocol attack called DROWN that could lead to the
decryption of TLS sessions. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced
below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could decrypt TLS sessions by using a server
supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a
Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, cause a Denial of Service condition,
obtain sensitive information from memory and (in rare circumstances)
recover RSA keys.

### Workaround

A workaround for DROWN is disabling the SSLv2 protocol on all SSL/TLS
servers.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.2g-r2"

```

Please note that beginning with OpenSSL 1.0.2, in order to mitigate the
DROWN attack, the OpenSSL project disables SSLv2 by default at
build-time. As this change would cause severe issues with some Gentoo
packages that depend on OpenSSL, Gentoo still ships OpenSSL with SSLv2
enabled at build-time. Note that this does not mean that you are still
vulnerable to DROWN because the OpenSSL project has taken further
precautions and applications would need to explicitly request SSLv2. We
are working on a migration path to phase out SSLv2 that ensures that no
user-facing issues occur. Please reference bug 576128 for further details
on how this decision was made.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for openssl fixes various security issues and bugs:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0702 aka the "CacheBleed" attack. (bsc#968050) Various changes
in the modular exponentation code were added that make sure that it is
not possible to recover RSA secret keys by analyzing cache-bank
conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.
Note that this was only exploitable if the malicious code was running
on the same hyper threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim
thread performing decryptions.
- CVE-2016-0705 (bnc#968047): A double free() bug in the DSA ASN1 parser
code was fixed that could be abused to facilitate a denial-of-service
attack.
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files
or application command line arguments. If user developed applications
generated config file data based on untrusted data, then this could
have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0798 (bnc#968265) The SRP user database lookup method
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() had a memory leak that attackers could abuse to
facility DoS attacks. To mitigate the issue, the seed handling in
SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user() was disabled even if the user has configured a
seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user().
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- CVE-2015-3197 (bsc#963415): The SSLv2 protocol did not block disabled
ciphers.
Note that the March 1st 2016 release also references following CVEs that
were fixed by us with CVE-2015-0293 in 2015:
- CVE-2016-0703 (bsc#968051): This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL
prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to
address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would have made the above
"DROWN" attack much easier.
- CVE-2016-0704 (bsc#968053): "Bleichenbacher oracle in SSLv2" This issue
only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time
the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. It would
have made the above "DROWN" attack much easier.
Bugs fixed:
- Avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading.
(bsc#952871)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS
sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a
Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and
non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting
SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP
or POP3) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability
is known as DROWN. [CVE-2016-0800]
A double free bug was discovered when OpenSSL parses malformed DSA private
keys and could lead to a DoS attack or memory corruption for applications that
receive DSA private keys from untrusted sources. This scenario is considered
rare. [CVE-2016-0705]
The SRP user database lookup method SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user had confusing memory
management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and
sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing
these two cases. [CVE-2016-0798]
In the BN\_hex2bn function, the number of hex digits is calculated using an int
value |i|. Later |bn\_expand| is called with a value of |i \* 4|. For large
values of |i| this can result in |bn\_expand| not allocating any memory because
|i \* 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL
leading to a subsequent NULL pointer dereference. For very large values of
|i|, the calculation |i \* 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In
this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is
insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in
BN\_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn is
ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This
is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. [CVE-2016-0797]
The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a "%s" formatted string in
the BIO\_\*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of
a string and cause an out-of-bounds read when printing very long strings.
[CVE-2016-0799]
A side-channel attack was found which makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the
Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture which could lead to the recovery of RSA
keys. [CVE-2016-0702]
s2\_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers.
If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they displace encrypted-key
bytes. [CVE-2016-0703]
s2\_srvr.c overwrites the wrong bytes in the master key when applying
Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites. [CVE-2016-0704]
III. Impact
Servers that have SSLv2 protocol enabled are vulnerable to the "DROWN" attack
which allows a remote attacker to fast attack many recorded TLS connections
made to the server, even when the client did not make any SSLv2 connections
themselves.
An attacker who can supply malformed DSA private keys to OpenSSL applications
may be able to cause memory corruption which would lead to a Denial of
Service condition. [CVE-2016-0705]
An attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause memory leak, which
could eventually lead to a Denial of Service condition. [CVE-2016-0798]
An attacker who can inject malformed data into an application may be able
to cause memory corruption which would lead to a Denial of Service
condition. [CVE-2016-0797, CVE-2016-0799]
A local attacker who has control of code in a thread running on the same
hyper-threaded core as the victim thread which is performing decryptions
could recover RSA keys. [CVE-2016-0702]
An eavesdropper who can intercept SSLv2 handshake can conduct an efficient
divide-and-conquer key recovery attack and use the server as an oracle to
determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server
and negligible computation. [CVE-2016-0703]
An attacker can use the Bleichenbacher oracle, which enables more efficient
variant of the DROWN attack. [CVE-2016-0704]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provides fixes for certain Oracle products for the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) Intel processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the [Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1) MOS note (Doc ID 2347948.1).

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 238 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [January 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2338411.1)

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2018 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 18 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.
