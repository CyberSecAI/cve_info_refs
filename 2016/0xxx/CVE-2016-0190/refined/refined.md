Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Windows handles USB disk mounting over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) via Microsoft RemoteFX. Specifically, the system fails to correctly tie the mounted USB disk to the session of the user who initiated the mount.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Session Management:** The core issue is the improper association of a mounted USB disk with the user session that requested the mount. This lack of proper session isolation allows other sessions to potentially access the resources, creating a data leak.
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure, rather than direct code execution or system compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain unauthorized access to file and directory information residing on the mounting user's USB disk. This means the attacker could read sensitive data, potentially leading to data theft or further exploitation, although, it is an information disclosure, not a direct remote code execution or system compromise
- The attacker does not gain access to other user's session, just the file system of the USB mounted on the targeted session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **RDP with RemoteFX:** The attack vector is through the use of RDP with the RemoteFX feature enabled, specifically when mounting USB storage devices via RDP redirection.
- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of local access to the system where the USB drive is being mounted, as the vulnerability allows access to the redirected drive from other sessions on that same system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to log into a separate session on the same system where another user has mounted a USB disk through RDP with RemoteFX. This could be a shared server environment.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system, just a valid account to log into.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated "Important" for affected versions of Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
- Windows 8.1 and RT 8.1 are not affected
- There are no identified mitigations or workarounds, highlighting the need to patch the affected systems
- The provided documents also indicate that Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 was affected and also encouraged to be patched.

In summary, CVE-2016-0190 is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by improper session management when mounting USB disks via RDP with RemoteFX. It could allow an attacker with local access to a system to read files from another user's redirected USB disk.
