Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in Internet Explorer's failure to properly enforce cross-domain policies. This allows an attacker to potentially access information from one domain and inject it into another, thereby violating the same-origin policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Enforcement of Cross-Domain Policies:** The core weakness is the inadequate implementation of the same-origin policy within Internet Explorer. This policy is meant to isolate scripts and content from different domains to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Although the vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution, it can be used to elevate the privileges of other code being run within Internet Explorer's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can bypass the cross-domain policy, gaining the ability to access potentially sensitive information related to the URL a user is accessing.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker could elevate the privileges of other code. For example, if an attacker first exploits another vulnerability to execute code, they could use this vulnerability to then have the code execute at a higher permission level.
*  **Further Compromise:**  The information gathered can be used to further compromise the system, or in combination with other vulnerabilities for more serious attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious website or leverages a compromised website to deliver the exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, such as tricking the user into clicking a malicious link.
*   **Email/Instant Messaging:** Attackers can distribute malicious links through email or instant messages.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject the malicious content on compromised websites that accept or host user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need the ability to host content on a web server, or to inject their content in websites.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must be able to convince users to visit a malicious website or click on a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
* This vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-009 via update 3134220
* The vulnerability has an "Important" severity rating for clients and "Low" for servers, due to the differing potential impacts. The CVSS scores were 4.3 (Medium) for both v2 and v3.
* While this vulnerability does not directly lead to remote code execution, it can facilitate other attacks by allowing an attacker to elevate privileges.
