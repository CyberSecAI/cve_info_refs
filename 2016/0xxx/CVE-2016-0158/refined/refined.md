  "CVE-2016-0158": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge does not properly enforce cross-domain policies, which could allow an attacker to access information from one domain and inject it into another domain.",
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Edge's improper enforcement of cross-domain policies. This allows an attacker to potentially access information from one domain and inject it into another. This can be exploited by hosting a specially crafted website or by injecting malicious content into compromised or user-content accepting websites. While the vulnerability itself doesn't allow arbitrary code execution, it can be chained with another vulnerability (like remote code execution) to escalate privileges of the arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper enforcement of cross-domain policies, leading to potential injection of content from one domain into another."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privileges in Microsoft Edge. This can enable arbitrary code to be run with higher privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Hosting a specially crafted website.",
      "Injecting malicious content into compromised websites.",
       "Injecting malicious content into websites accepting user-provided content."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website or interact with malicious content.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is related to the implementation of the JavaScript Proxy object, where certain script actions can be abused to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into arbitrary domains, leading to Universal Cross Site Scripting (UXSS)."
