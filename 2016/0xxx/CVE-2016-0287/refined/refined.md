Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how IBM i Access for Windows stores user credentials (both IBM iSeries and Windows passwords) in the Windows registry. These passwords are not securely stored, using a simple XOR-based encoding algorithm that can be easily reversed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage:** Passwords are saved in the registry under `HKEY_USERS\<SID>\Software\IBM\Client Access Express\CurrentVersion\Volatile\Communication\Time Stamps\<HOST>\<USER_ID>\Function Admin Timestamp` using a weak encoding mechanism.
*   **Local Access:** Any user with administrative privileges on the Windows machine can access and decode the stored passwords, even if they are not authorized to access the iSeries host or other user accounts.
*   **Exposure of Windows Credentials**: The software also stores the Windows user's password in the same insecure manner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers with local admin privileges can extract iSeries and Windows passwords from the registry.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Stolen iSeries credentials can be used to access the iSeries host, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Gaining access to a domain admin's password can be used to extend an attacker's foothold in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local administrative access to the Windows machine where IBM i Access for Windows is installed and has saved the credentials
*   **Registry Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Windows registry where the encoded credentials are saved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Administrator Rights:** The attacker must have administrative privileges on the compromised Windows system.
*   **Registry Access:** Ability to read registry keys containing the encoded credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content highlights that the vulnerability is not just limited to iSeries passwords but also includes the user's Windows password.
*   IBM iSeries has a default policy that limits failed login attempts which can be exploited to create a DoS.
*   Nessus plugin 57849 can detect this vulnerability and extract the cached passwords.
*   IBM released a fix for this issue (SI60523).
