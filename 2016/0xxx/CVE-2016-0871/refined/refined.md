Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-0871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability stems from the EG2 Web Control application storing sensitive information, specifically credentials, in cleartext within a configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The application does not properly encrypt or protect sensitive data, making it easily accessible to unauthorized users if they can access the configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Credentials:** An attacker can directly access the configuration file and view the stored credentials in cleartext. This could allow for further unauthorized actions.
*   **Potential for System Configuration Modification:** A remote attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to perform administrative operations allowing the EG2 connection to configure the system via the internet rather than connecting directly to the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, indicating a network-based attack vector. An attacker would need to gain access to the device or configuration file over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory states that an attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the EG2 system or its configuration file over a network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected product is the Eaton Lighting Systems EG2 Web Control application, specifically versions V4.04P and prior.
*   The product facilitates internet and Wi-Fi LAN connections into the iLumin network, primarily in residential applications.
*   A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 was assigned with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating high confidentiality impact and no integrity or availability impact.
*   Eaton Lighting Systems has released a firmware patch to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The functionality causing the vulnerability is being removed from the device as it is being moved to end of life and is being replaced by a new platform.
