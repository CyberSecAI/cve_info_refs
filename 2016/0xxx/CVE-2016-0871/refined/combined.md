ICS Advisory
# Eaton Lighting Systems EG2 Web Control Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-061-03

## OVERVIEW

This advisory was originally posted to the US-CERT secure Portal library on March 1, 2016, and is being released to the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site.

Independent researcher Maxim Rupp has identified vulnerabilities in Eaton Lighting Systems’ EG2 Web Control application. Eaton Lighting Systems has produced a firmware patch to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Eaton Lighting Systems reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions:

* EG2 Web Control V4.04P and prior.

## IMPACT

A remote attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to perform administrative operations allowing the EG2 connection to configure the system via the Internet rather than by connecting directly into the network.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Eaton Lighting Systems is a US-based company that maintains offices worldwide.

The affected products, EG2 Web Control, facilitate Internet and Wi-Fi LAN connection into the iLumin network. According to Eaton Lighting Systems, these products are used primarily in residential applications. Eaton Lighting Systems estimates these products are used worldwide.

CVE-2016-0871NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0871, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed March 01, 2016

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Eaton Lighting Systems has made the decision to remove this functionality from the device. The EG2 is a legacy product that is being moved to “end-of-life” later this year. A new hardware and OS platform is replacing this system. Eaton Lighting Systems has produced a firmware patch to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Please contact Eaton Lighting Systems for advice on updating the firmware.

ICS-CERT recommends, as quality assurance, that users test the update in a test development environment that reflects their production environment prior to installation. In addition, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
