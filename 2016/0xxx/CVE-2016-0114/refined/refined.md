Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0114:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in how Internet Explorer processes HTML input elements with the type "range". Specifically, a memory structure is freed and then reused, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The core issue is that a block of memory is accessed after it has been freed. This can happen when a pointer to that memory is still in use.
- Memory corruption: The use-after-free can cause memory corruption, leading to unexpected program behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege escalation: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious webpage: An attacker can host a webpage that exploits the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.
- Malicious files: Opening a malicious file may also trigger the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a user to either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file. This is typically done through social engineering tactics, such as:
    - Sending enticing emails or instant messages containing links or attachments.
    - Compromising legitimate websites to redirect users to attacker-controlled content.
- The attacker requires no specific network position, as the attack can be initiated through the internet.
