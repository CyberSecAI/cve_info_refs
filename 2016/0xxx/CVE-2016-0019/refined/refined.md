Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of **CVE-2016-0019**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) failing to enforce the default restriction of not allowing remote logons for accounts without passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The RDP service does not properly restrict remote access for accounts that lack passwords, bypassing the intended security measure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the security feature designed to prevent remote logon for accounts without passwords.
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to a remote host as another user, potentially with elevated privileges, by logging into accounts with no password.
- **Compromise:** If the attacker is able to log on with elevated privileges they could gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker uses an older version of the RDP client to connect to a vulnerable Windows 10 host.
- **Account Enumeration:** Once connected, the attacker can list user accounts on the host.
- **Password-less Logon:** The attacker attempts to log on as various users, and if a user account has no password set, the system improperly allows access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the target system via RDP.
- **RDP Client:** The attacker must use an older version of the RDP client to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of User Accounts:**  The attacker must generate a list of available user accounts on the target system.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability exists on Windows 10 hosts running RDP services.
- The security update enforces the default setting of not allowing remote logon for accounts without passwords.
- At the time of the bulletin, Microsoft was unaware of any attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
