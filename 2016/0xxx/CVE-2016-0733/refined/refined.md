Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2016-0733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Ranger API's authentication mechanism. It incorrectly allows access when a valid username is provided along with a null (empty) password. The system fails to properly validate that a password is provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass authentication by submitting an empty password with a valid username. The system does not enforce password verification when a username is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious actor can gain access to the Ranger Admin UI and potentially the underlying system by exploiting the authentication bypass.
*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:**  With unauthorized access, the attacker could read or manipulate data or configuration through the Ranger API. In the example, the attacker successfully retrieves a list of users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Interaction:** The vulnerability is exposed through the Ranger API, specifically during the authentication process.
*   **Basic Authentication:** The exploit uses basic authentication with an empty password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the Ranger API.
*   **Knowledge of Valid Usernames:** The attacker needs to know a valid username to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No Privileged access required:** This vulnerability can be exploited by anyone with the above conditions.

**Additional Information:**
* This vulnerability is described as "important"
* This vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.5.1 of Apache Ranger.
* The vulnerability is demonstrated with a curl command that sends an empty password in the Authorization header.
