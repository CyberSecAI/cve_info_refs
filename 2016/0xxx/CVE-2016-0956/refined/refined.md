    "ID": "CVE-2016-0956",
    "content": "The provided content details an information disclosure vulnerability in Apache Sling Framework v2.3.6 (used in Adobe AEM).  \n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nLack of proper security controls or misconfiguration in some Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) instances allows remote, unauthenticated users to enumerate local system files and folders. This occurs due to how the `SlingPostServlet` handles `delete` requests.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   Information Disclosure: The application leaks file/folder names in the HTML response.\n*   Improper Error Handling: Sending a `delete` request to the `SlingPostServlet` with an invalid path results in a 500 error page with a `ChangeLog` field that exposes file and directory information.\n*   Lack of access control on certain paths\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can enumerate directory and file structures on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive system information, configuration files, or other confidential data. This information can then be used for further attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   Remote, unauthenticated access.\n*   Sending a crafted `delete` request using HTTP POST to the `SlingPostServlet` with a wildcard in the `:applyTo` parameter targeting a directory like `/etc/*` or another sensitive path.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the target web server. \n* No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can be an unauthenticated remote user.",
