  "source": "www.zerodayinitiative.com_381ccada_20250125_022423.html",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft .NET Framework handles a specific DLL. By placing a specially crafted DLL with a specific name in a directory, an attacker can force a process to load this arbitrary DLL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DLL side-loading",
      "Improper input validation during library load."

    "impact": "Remote code execution. The attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the process, allowing them to potentially take complete control of the affected system.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage",
       "Opening a malicious directory",
      "Opening a malicious device."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to lure a target user into visiting a malicious web page, or opening a malicious directory or device containing the crafted DLL to trigger the vulnerability."
