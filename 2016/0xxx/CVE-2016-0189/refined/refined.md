  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-0189",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the way the JScript and VBScript engines handle objects in memory. Specifically, a memory corruption vulnerability occurs when VBScript resizes an array to a smaller size, freeing memory, and then crafted strings are placed in this freed memory. Subsequently, a reference to this freed memory is accessed, causing a read of the crafted string and leaking a memory address. This allows an attacker to overwrite a 'Safe Mode' flag.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption",
         "Out-of-bounds memory access"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow remote code execution, giving the attacker the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take full control of the system, install software, modify data, and create new user accounts.",
      "attack_vector": "The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website viewed using Internet Explorer. An attacker can also embed a malicious ActiveX control in a document or application hosting the IE rendering engine, or compromise websites that accept user provided content.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page that leverages the vulnerability, or compromise legitimate sites. They would need to entice a user to visit the malicious page or interact with the malicious content. No special capabilities are required beyond creating and hosting malicious HTML/VBScript code."
    },
      {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-0189",
      "root_cause": "Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the JScript and VBScript engines render when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or compromise a site to inject the malicious code, and then entice a user to visit the site and load the malicious code in Internet Explorer."
