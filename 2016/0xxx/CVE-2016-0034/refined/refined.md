{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Silverlight decodes strings using a malicious decoder that can return negative offsets, causing Silverlight to replace unsafe object headers with attacker-provided content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of decoder results leading to negative offsets.",
       "Unsafe object header replacement due to negative offsets"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker would need to host a compromised website containing a specially crafted Silverlight application and convince a user to visit it. Alternatively, attackers could exploit websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website and convince users to visit the website. This may involve using social engineering to trick users into clicking links in emails or instant messages."
