{
  "CVE-2016-0721": {
    "description": "It was found that pcsd did not invalidate cookies on the server side when a user logged out. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform session fixation attacks on pcsd.",
    "root_cause": "The pcsd web UI did not invalidate session cookies on the server side upon user logout.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Session fixation vulnerability",
      "Lack of server-side session invalidation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially perform session fixation attacks on pcsd by reusing a valid session cookie of a logged out user.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could obtain a valid session cookie, and then reuse it after the legitimate user logs out.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to obtain a valid session cookie (e.g., by eavesdropping network traffic or through other means). They would also need to induce a user to log out.",
     "additional_details": "The issue was addressed by invalidating the server side session upon user logout, and ensuring that session information is correctly managed on the server side. The upstream fix included changes to store session data on the server side and to invalidate sessions upon logout. The vulnerability exists because the pcsd web UI did not invalidate session cookies on the server side, only in the browser's cookie cache, meaning that the session remained valid until the cookie expires."
