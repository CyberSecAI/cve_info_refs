Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure within the way Click-to-Run (C2R) components handle objects in memory. This improper handling can lead to an Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **ASLR Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass ASLR, a security mechanism designed to randomize memory locations to prevent exploitation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The root cause is the improper handling of objects in memory by C2R, leading to the disclosure of information useful to bypass ASLR.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **ASLR Bypass:** By itself, the ASLR bypass does not directly enable remote code execution.
*   **Enabling Further Exploitation:** However, the bypass could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution vulnerabilities, to increase the likelihood of successful exploitation. This allows an attacker to bypass an important protection mechanism, thus increasing the risk of executing arbitrary code.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to run arbitrary code by using the ASLR bypass in conjunction with another vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to log on to the affected system.
*   **Execution of Malicious Application:** The attacker must run a specifically crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** Attackers must have local access to the vulnerable machine.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** They need to be able to execute a crafted application on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is specifically related to Click-to-Run (C2R) components of Microsoft Office.
*   The provided content from the Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for September 2016 also mentions this CVE, linking it to MS16-107 (Security Update for Microsoft Office). It classifies the exploitability as "2 - Exploitation Less Likely", noting that it only applies to the latest software release.
*   The content from the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-107 provides the most details about this CVE, classifying it as an "information disclosure" that could lead to an ASLR bypass.

In summary, CVE-2016-0137 is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows bypassing the ASLR protection mechanism, which can then be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities for more significant impacts, including arbitrary code execution.
