ICS Advisory
# Advantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-014-01

## OVERVIEW

Ilya Karpov of Positive Technologies, Ivan Sanchez, Andrea Micalizzi, Ariele Caltabiano, Fritz Sands, Steven Seeley, and an anonymous researcher have identified multiple vulnerabilities in Advantech WebAccess application. Many of these vulnerabilities were reported through the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and iDefense. Advantech has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Ivan Sanchez has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities which he reported.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Advantech reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of WebAccess:

* WebAccess Version 8.0 and prior versions.

## IMPACT

An attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities may be able to upload, create, or delete arbitrary files on the target system, deny access to valid users, or remotely execute arbitrary code.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Advantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.

The affected product, WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web-based SCADA and human-machine interface (HMI) product. According to Advantech, WebAccess is deployed across several sectors including Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Government Facilities. Advantech estimates that these products are used globally.

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Advantech has released a new version of WebAccess, Version 8.1, to address the reported vulnerabilities. This new version is available on the Advantech website at the following location:

<http://www.advantech.com/industrial-automation/webaccess>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at[http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

This product is provided subject to this [Notification](/notification "Follow link") and this [Privacy & Use](/privacy-policy "Follow link") policy.
