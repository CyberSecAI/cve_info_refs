  "CVE-2016-0778": {
    "description": "The (1) roaming_read and (2) roaming_write functions in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2, when certain proxy and forward options are enabled, do not properly maintain connection file descriptors, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by requesting many forwardings.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "Improper handling of connection file descriptors during roaming reconnection.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Heap-based buffer overflow in `packet_read_seqnr` and `packet_write_wait` due to inconsistent handling of file descriptors.",
          "File descriptor leak in `ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect` (though not directly exploitable for this CVE)."
        ],
        "impact": "Denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Malicious SSH server or compromised trusted server.",
           "Exploitation requires non-default OpenSSH client options such as `ProxyCommand` and either `ForwardAgent` or `ForwardX11`."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious SSH server or a compromised trusted server. The attacker also needs to be able to control or manipulate the response of the server to trigger the reconnection and the buffer overflow"

    ],
       "mitigations": [
      "Disable roaming via 'UseRoaming no' option in SSH configuration or command line.",
         "Upgrade OpenSSH to version 7.1p2 or later, which disables roaming by default.",
      "Disable the ProxyCommand option or the forwarding options in ssh client configurations."
