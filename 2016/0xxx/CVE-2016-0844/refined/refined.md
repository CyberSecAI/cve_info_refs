Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0844:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Qualcomm RF driver. Specifically, there's an issue in how the driver handles socket ioctl commands.  Untrusted or isolated applications were able to access device private commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient access control**: Untrusted applications could access privileged device commands through socket ioctl.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of privilege:** A local malicious application can execute arbitrary code within the kernel. This could lead to a permanent device compromise, potentially requiring a re-flash of the operating system to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local malicious application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the user's device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was rated as critical severity due to the potential for a local permanent device compromise.
- The fix involves restricting access to socket ioctl commands, allowing only shell users to access unprivileged socket ioctl commands, and preventing untrusted/isolated apps to access private device commands.
- The vulnerability is addressed by code changes in the `external/sepolicy` repository, and an additional patch from Linux upstream.
