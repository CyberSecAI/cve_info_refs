- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of a specially crafted Java Message Service (JMS) ObjectMessage object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack using a specially crafted serialized Java Message Service (JMS) ObjectMessage object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a remote attacker with the ability to send crafted JMS messages to the vulnerable system. Low privileges are required.
