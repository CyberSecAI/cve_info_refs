- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor allows local users to inject commands that are then executed with administrator privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Execution with unnecessary privileges, command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can execute arbitrary commands with administrator privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user account on the system running the vulnerable IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor.
