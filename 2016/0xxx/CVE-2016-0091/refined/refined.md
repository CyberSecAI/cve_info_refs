Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-0091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `OleLoadPicture` function in Microsoft Windows OLE.
*   The `OleLoadPicture` function uses user-supplied data to calculate a buffer length for allocation.
*   When the image is a bitmap, the function can write beyond the allocated buffer boundary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** The vulnerability leads to heap corruption due to the out-of-bounds write.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Windows OLE fails to properly validate user input related to image data, leading to incorrect buffer length calculations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user.
*   **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker must convince a user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
*   **Malicious Files:** Exploitation can occur through specially crafted files, such as those containing malicious images, opened by the user.
*   **Web Pages:** Exploitation can also occur through specially crafted web pages that a user visits.
*  **Email Messages:** An attacker could send a malicious file or link through email to be opened by the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, delivering the exploit via the web or email.
*   **User Persuasion:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to interact with the malicious content (file or web page).

**Additional Information:**

*   Microsoft released security update `3143136` to address this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID `22661`.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2015-12-03, with coordinated public release on 2016-03-08.
*   The exploitability assessment for this vulnerability is "2 - Exploitation Less Likely" according to Microsoft's Exploitability Index.
*   There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds for this vulnerability.
