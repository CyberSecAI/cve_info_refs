- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When an exception occurs, the resulting text displayed to the user may contain internal information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leakage through error logs. The system displays internal information when an exception occurs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can obtain sensitive information contained in error logs.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An authenticated user can trigger an exception leading to the information disclosure.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
