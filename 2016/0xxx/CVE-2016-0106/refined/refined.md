Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles custom data attributes attached to HTML elements. Specifically, it is triggered when manipulating a document's elements, which forces a string in memory to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free condition. A memory location is freed but then subsequently accessed, leading to unexpected behavior. The vulnerability occurs in `CDataset` during `SetItem` and `RemoveItem` operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure. Attackers can read the contents of freed memory locations.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the immediate impact is information disclosure, the advisory notes that this information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through a malicious web page or file.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, meaning a user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Malicious Content Creation:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted webpage or file that manipulates HTML elements and triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince the victim to interact with the malicious content. This could involve enticing a user via email, instant messages, or compromised websites hosting the malicious content.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is located in `CDataset` component of Internet Explorer and is related to the functions `SetItem` and `RemoveItem`.
*   Microsoft has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer including IE9, IE10 and IE11
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection using Digital Vaccine filter ID 22288.
