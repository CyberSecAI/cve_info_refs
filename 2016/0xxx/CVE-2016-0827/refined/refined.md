Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-0827:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a potential overflow within the "effect wrapper" in mediaserver when handling media files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during processing of the "effect command handler" where parameter size is not properly validated. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** Lack of proper size checks on the parameter field of "effect command handler" when processing a specially crafted media file leads to a buffer overflow. This can corrupt memory, which could be exploited.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code does not adequately validate the size of the parameters, allowing an attacker to supply larger than expected data, which triggers the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of an elevated system application (mediaserver). This gives the attacker the ability to gain elevated capabilities and permissions that a third-party app should not have, such as Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions. This could then enable further malicious activity on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A malicious application installed on the device is needed to exploit this issue.
- **Media File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the mediaserver processes a specially crafted media file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Install a Malicious App:** The attacker needs the ability to install a malicious application on the target device.
- **Ability to Craft Special Media Files:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific type of media file containing malicious parameters to trigger the vulnerability in the mediaserver.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The provided commit log from AOSP highlights that the fix involves adding checks on the parameter size field in the effect command handlers to avoid overflows, preventing invalid comparisons with minimum allowed sizes for command and reply buffers.

This vulnerability is rated as **High severity** due to the potential for privilege escalation.
