{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of objects in memory by the DirectX Graphics kernel subsystem (dxgkrnl.sys). Specifically, a buffer overflow can happen when the `NumRects` value is larger than `D3DKMT_MAX_PRESENT_HISTORY_RECTS` during the processing of the `DirtyRegions` structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
    "Improper memory mapping"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, potentially gaining full control over the affected system. This could lead to the attacker installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is local. An attacker needs to log on to the target system and run a specially crafted application. User interaction may be required, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires local access to the target system with the ability to execute code. They must log on to the system and then execute a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability."
