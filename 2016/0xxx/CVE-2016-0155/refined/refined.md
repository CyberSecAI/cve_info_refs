- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Edge.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Edge leading to potential remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take full control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Hosting a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convincing a user to visit it.
    - Injecting malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept/host user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host malicious content or inject it into a website and trick a user into visiting that website using Microsoft Edge.
