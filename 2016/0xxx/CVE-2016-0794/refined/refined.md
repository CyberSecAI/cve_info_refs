## Analysis of CVE-2016-0794

Based on the provided content, the following information related to CVE-2016-0794 can be extracted:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by multiple out-of-bounds overflows in the Lotus WordPro (LWP) filter of LibreOffice. Specifically, the issue arises from insufficient checks when parsing LWP document records, such as LwpTocSuperLayout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple out-of-bounds memory corruption vulnerabilities are present in the LWP parsing logic. These stem from insufficient checks on offsets and buffer bounds while handling LWP document data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause LibreOffice to crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could potentially exploit these overflows to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the malicious file. This is the more severe impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through specially crafted LWP document files. An attacker tricks a user into opening a malicious LWP document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify LWP document files to include malicious data.
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver this specially crafted LWP document to a potential victim (e.g., via email, website download).
* No specific network position or user authentication is required. However, the user needs to interact by opening the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by an anonymous contributor working with VeriSign iDefense Labs.
*  The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-3482-1) mentions the vulnerability affects multiple LibreOffice versions, and provides package upgrade instructions for Debian Wheezy, Jessie, Stretch, and Sid distributions.
*   SUSE and openSUSE security updates confirm the vulnerability as a moderate severity issue
* Red Hat security advisory notes that the issue was fixed and also mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
* The Suse CVE page also shows CVSS v3 score as 7.8 with vectors CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H , indicating local access with user interaction required for a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
* The LibreOffice advisory specifically mentions the vulnerability impacts LibreOffice versions before 5.0.4/5.1.0 and were discovered by VeriSign iDefense Labs.

```
Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple out-of-bounds overflows due to insufficient checks when parsing LWP document records.
