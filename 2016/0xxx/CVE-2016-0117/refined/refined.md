Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Windows parses specially crafted PDF files. The specific parsing flaw is not detailed, but it leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that incorrect parsing of a PDF file leads to memory corruption, which can be leveraged to execute malicious code.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the memory corruption allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **User Privilege Impact:** Users with fewer rights will be less impacted than those with admin rights, but the vulnerability can still allow for code execution within their user context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Files:** The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file. This could be achieved through various methods, such as:
    *   Email attachments.
    *   Compromised websites hosting the malicious PDF.
    *   Social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a specially crafted PDF:** The attacker needs the technical ability to create or modify PDF documents to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to deliver a malicious PDF:** The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious PDF to the target user. This could involve:
    *  Email sending capabilities
    *  Web server hosting
    *  Compromised sharing systems

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is considered **critical** for affected versions of Windows, due to the potential for complete system compromise.
*   The provided documents indicate that the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   The fix involves modifying how Windows parses PDF files.
*   No workarounds were identified by Microsoft.
