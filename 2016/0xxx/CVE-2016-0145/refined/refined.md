        "source": "docs.microsoft.com_cb3a206f_20250125_132522.html",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the Windows font library improperly handling specially crafted embedded fonts.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A graphics memory corruption vulnerability exists in how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document or visit a webpage containing specially crafted embedded fonts.",
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with a malicious document or webpage."

         "source": "www.exploit-db.com_dadd726c_20250125_132524.html",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of the vulnerability is in the processing of TTF font files, specifically within the 'EBLC' and 'EBSC' tables of the font file.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A pool-based buffer overflow or some other type of pool corruption occurs during the processing of the EBLC and EBSC tables of a TTF font. This leads to memory corruption.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitation can lead to a kernel crash, which could potentially be leveraged for remote code execution in the context of the Windows kernel.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TTF font file. This can be achieved by opening the file using the Windows Font Viewer or by embedding the font in a document or webpage.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TTF font file to the targeted system. The user must then trigger the font processing either by viewing it directly or via another application."
