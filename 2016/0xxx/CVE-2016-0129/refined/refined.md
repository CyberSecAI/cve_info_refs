- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Edge.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying data, and creating new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince the user to visit it. Alternatively, they can inject the exploit into compromised websites or sites that accept user content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or interact with malicious content. The attacker does not have the ability to force users to view the attacker-controlled content directly.
