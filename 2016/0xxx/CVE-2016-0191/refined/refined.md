Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0191:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Chakra JavaScript engine within Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory. Specifically, it involves the `Array.concat` method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability allows for memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory within the scripting engine. Specifically, the `Array.concat` method can be manipulated to read uninitialized data from the stack.
- **Uninitialized Memory Read:** The vulnerability allows JavaScript to read uninitialized data from a memory location on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability and lure a user to visit it using Microsoft Edge.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites, or sites that host user-provided content, to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Files:** Attackers can embed a ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or embed malicious content in a document or webpage.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file. The attacker needs to convince the user to perform this action, typically through social engineering.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by lokihardt.
- Microsoft released an update to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a specific filter ID.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical for Windows clients and moderate for Windows servers.
