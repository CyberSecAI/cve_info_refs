Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Windows Imaging Component failing to properly handle objects in memory. This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper object handling within the Windows Imaging Component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- An attacker can take control of the affected system.
- Attackers can install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer user rights could be less impacted than users with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince a user to view the website through social engineering tactics like malicious links in emails or instant messages.
- **File sharing attack:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that exploits the vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to interact with malicious content (either a website or a document file).
- No special network position is required, as the attack is based on user interaction.
- They do not need any system access to start with.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Imaging Component handles objects in memory.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds were identified.
- This vulnerability is rated as "Critical".
