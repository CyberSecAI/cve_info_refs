  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2016-0830",
      "root_cause": "When a large number of LE (Low Energy) Bluetooth devices are discovered, the Bluetooth daemon attempts to write a config file to disk. If the config file becomes too large, it causes the BT daemon to crash upon startup.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input validation on the number of discovered Bluetooth devices leading to an overly large config file being created.",
         "Absence of a mechanism to limit the number of config entries to prevent the file from becoming too large"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service to the Bluetooth service. The Bluetooth service crashes and can potentially only be fixed by a device flash.",
       "attack_vectors": "Proximity to the target device. The attacker needs to be in range to discover a large number of Bluetooth LE devices, causing the file to grow and the service to crash upon restart.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and be capable of generating a large number of LE Bluetooth devices"
    }
