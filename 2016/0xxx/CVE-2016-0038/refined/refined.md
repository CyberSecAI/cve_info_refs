  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when a specially crafted Journal file is opened in Windows Journal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to execute in the context of the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Journal file with an affected version of Windows Journal."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send a specially crafted Journal file to the user and then convince the user to open the file. In an email attack scenario, this can be done by sending an email with the malicious file attached."
