- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor does not enforce the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing HSTS header.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially intercept and obtain sensitive information using man-in-the-middle (MitM) techniques.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
