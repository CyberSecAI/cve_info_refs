Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Office's failure to properly handle objects in memory. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Office.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- System compromise: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- For users with fewer rights, the impact would be less but still significant.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack Scenario:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Office file to a user and persuades them to open it.
- **Web-based Attack Scenario:** An attacker hosts a website (or uses a compromised one) containing a specially crafted file. The attacker then has to convince the user to visit the website and open the malicious file.
- **Preview Pane:** The preview pane is an attack vector for CVE-2016-0025

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted Microsoft Office file to the victim.
- For the web-based attack, the attacker needs to be able to host the file on a website or compromise a legitimate one.
- User interaction is required - the user has to be convinced to open the malicious file.
- No special attacker position is required, the attacker can be external to the network.
