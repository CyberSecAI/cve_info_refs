Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-0060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue in how Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge improperly access objects in memory. Specifically, in Internet Explorer, the vulnerability is related to how CAttrArray objects are handled, leading to a use-after-free condition. In Microsoft Edge, the vulnerability is related to how text nodes within document fragments are processed, where a flag value can be misused as a pointer to a Tree::ANode object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Both IE and Edge suffer from memory corruption issues due to improper access of objects in memory.
*   **Use-After-Free:** In Internet Explorer, a use-after-free condition occurs with CAttrArray objects due to manipulation of document elements.
*  **Type Confusion:** In Microsoft Edge, a type confusion vulnerability exists when processing text nodes in document fragments where a flag can be misinterpreted as an object pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
*   **Control of Affected System:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based attacks:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites, or websites accepting user-provided content or advertisements.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious website or open a malicious file/attachment, often through emails, instant messages or other forms of deception.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host or inject malicious content:** Attackers need the ability to host a malicious website or inject code into a website that a target user will visit.
*   **User interaction:**  The user needs to interact with the malicious content, either by visiting a webpage or opening a malicious file.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability, but the impact is greater if the victim has higher privileges.

**Additional Details from ZDI:**

*   **ZDI-16-159 (Internet Explorer):**  This advisory highlights the specific use-after-free vulnerability within the usage of CAttrArray objects in Internet Explorer. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force a CAttrArray object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.
*   **ZDI-16-165 (Microsoft Edge):** This advisory details a type confusion vulnerability related to how Microsoft Edge processes text nodes within document fragments, leading to the possibility of a flag value being treated as a pointer to a Tree::ANode object.

**Severity:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Windows clients and **Moderate** for Windows servers in both Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerabilities are addressed by updates that modify how Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge handle objects in memory.
*   For Internet Explorer, the update corrects how it handles CAttrArray objects.
*   For Microsoft Edge, the update corrects how it processes text nodes and ensures ASLR is properly implemented.
