- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software due to the software's failure to properly handle objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  Opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
    -  Email attack: Sending a specially crafted file to a user and convincing them to open it.
    -  Web-based attack: Hosting a website (or using a compromised one) containing a specially crafted file and convincing users to visit it and open the file, often through links in emails or instant messages.
    - For certain listed software, the Preview Pane is also an attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
    - Ability to convince a user to open the malicious file (through email, web, etc).
