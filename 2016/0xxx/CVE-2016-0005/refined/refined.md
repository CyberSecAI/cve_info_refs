{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper enforcement of cross-domain policies, allowing unauthorized access to information across domains."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer, enabling them to access information from one domain and inject it into another. The vulnerability itself does not permit arbitrary code execution, but it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to leverage the elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack scenario involving a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.",
       "Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could be used to deliver the exploit"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to visit their malicious site, typically through social engineering techniques such as tricking them into clicking on a link. The attacker would not be able to force the user to view the attacker-controlled content. "
