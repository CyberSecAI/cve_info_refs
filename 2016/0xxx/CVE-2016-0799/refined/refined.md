Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-0799:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The internal `fmtstr()` and `doapr_outch()` functions within OpenSSL, particularly on 64-bit systems, may miscalculate the length of a string. This miscalculation leads to out-of-bounds memory access when handling large amounts of untrusted data passed to `BIO_*printf` functions. 

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `fmtstr()` and `doapr_outch()` functions can miscalculate string lengths, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Out-of-bounds Memory Access:** Due to the string length miscalculation, functions attempt to access memory outside of allocated buffers.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** In the case of allocation failures,  `doapr_outch()` might attempt to write to a memory location at an offset from NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to crashes and other conditions that make a service or application unavailable.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Incorrect calculations and out-of-bounds memory access can lead to memory corruption.
*  **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not definitively stated, the potential for memory corruption exists and could lead to arbitrary code execution in certain conditions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Data Input to BIO functions:** Applications that use the `BIO_*printf` functions and pass large amounts of untrusted data to these functions are vulnerable.
*  **Untrusted ASN.1 Data:** Applications that print human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data from untrusted sources are susceptible.
*   **Command line arguments:** OpenSSL command-line applications may also be vulnerable when printing ASN.1 data or processing untrusted data passed as command-line arguments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide large or untrusted data as input:** The attacker must be able to control the input passed to the vulnerable BIO functions.
*   **Knowledge of where to pass untrusted data** An attacker needs to know how/where applications print ASN.1 data or use `BIO_*printf` functions with untrusted data.
*  **64 Bit System (for some exploitation scenarios):** The issue related to the string length miscalculation is primarily a concern on systems where the size of `size_t` is greater than the size of `int` (usually 64-bit systems)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `libssl` library itself is not considered directly vulnerable but applications utilizing the library are at risk.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the application prints out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data from untrusted sources, or if untrusted data is passed as command-line arguments.
*   The flaw is due to an integer overflow that leads to out-of-bounds access in functions printing formatted strings (`fmtstr()` and `doapr_outch()`) with large amounts of untrusted data.
*   The content from opensuse lists indicates that a patch is available to update the openssl library for multiple SUSE products.
*   The bugzilla entry provides the upstream fix for the flaw.
*   Red Hat references for this CVE state that this affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1. OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2g. OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1s.
