  "CVE-2016-0546": {
    "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle MySQL 5.5.46 and earlier, 5.6.27 and earlier, and 5.7.9 and MariaDB before 5.5.47, 10.0.x before 10.0.23, and 10.1.x before 10.1.10 allows local users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Client. NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that these are multiple buffer overflows in the mysqlshow tool that allow remote database servers to have unspecified impact via a long table or database name.",
    "Root cause": "Buffer overflows due to incorrect usage of strcpy() and sprintf() in mysql_plugin and mysqlshow tools and incorrect implementation of the ssl_verify_server_cert option that didn't properly verify server hostname.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Improper certificate validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a complete denial of service (DoS), data corruption, or arbitrary code execution. A man-in-the-middle attack could also spoof SSL servers.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local user executing mysql_plugin or mysqlshow tools with crafted arguments.",
      "Remote authenticated user connecting to a malicious server via an insecure SSL connection due to improper certificate validation."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Local system access to execute vulnerable tools.",
      "Ability to intercept network traffic and replace server SSL certificate."
    ],
    "Additional Information": "Some overflows are mitigated by FORTIFY_SOURCE, causing application abort without code execution. Vulnerable tools are intended for use by trusted system/database administrators.",
     "Affected Packages": [
      "mariadb",
      "mysql",
      "libmysql55client18",
      "libmysqlclient-devel",
      "libmysqlclient_r18",
        "libmysqld-devel",
       "mysql-community-server"
    ]
  }
