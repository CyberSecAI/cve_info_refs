- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An invalid MQ client protocol flow could cause a memory access violation on the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory access violation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A memory access violation on the server could impact other channels running in the same process, potentially leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Invalid MQ client protocol flows.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send malformed MQ client protocol flows to the server.
