| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1298906#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 12:11:01 UTC  ``` Integer signedness issues were discovered in IndicRearrangementProcessor and IndicRearrangementProcessor2 in the ICU Layout Engine.  A specially crafted font file could cause an application using ICU to parse untrusted fonts to crash and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.  ICU code is embedded the 2D component in OpenJDK and used by FontManager.  An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with Java Virtual Machine privileges and bypass Java sandbox restrictions.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1298906#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 12:15:44 UTC  ``` Upstream fix changes type of firstGlyph and lastGlyph from unsigned int to signed int, reverting part of the fix for [CVE-2015-4844](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4844) ([bug 1273318](show_bug.cgi?id=1273318 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-4844 ICU: missing boundary checks in layout engine (OpenJDK 2D, 8132042)")) applied as part of the previous Oct 2015 CPU:  <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/rev/dbb4e2bdfa9e#l2.15>  This change also impacts boundary checks added in the same commit, as they may be optimized out by compiler when signed types are used.  The above patch has not been applied to ICU yet, hence ICU packages are not affected.

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.7.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime
Environment and the OpenJDK 7 Java Software Development Kit.

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the JPEG image format decoder in
the AWT component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted JPEG image could cause
a Java application to crash or, possibly execute arbitrary code. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0483)

An integer signedness issue was found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could possibly cause
the Java Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, allowing an untrusted
Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2016-0494)

It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK did not properly
enforce the totalEntitySizeLimit limit. An attacker able to make a Java
application process a specially crafted XML file could use this flaw to
make the application consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-0466)

A flaw was found in the way TLS 1.2 could use the MD5 hash function for
signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a TLS
handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to force a TLS connection to
use the MD5 hash function could use this flaw to conduct collision attacks
to impersonate a TLS server or an authenticated TLS client. (CVE-2015-7575)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, Networking, and JMX
components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use
these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-4871,
CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448)

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# IcedTea: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-14**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IcedTea allowing remote
attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability through
various vectors.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/icedtea** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.2.6.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.2.6.4**revision >= **6.1.13.9**< **6** |

| Package | **dev-java/icedtea-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.2.6.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.2.6.4**revision >= **6.1.13.9**< **6** |

### Background

IcedTea’s aim is to provide OpenJDK in a form suitable for easy
configuration, compilation and distribution with the primary goal of
allowing inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions.

### Description

Various OpenJDK attack vectors in IcedTea, such as 2D, Corba, Hotspot,
Libraries, and JAXP, exist which allows remote attackers to affect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of vulnerable systems. This
includes the possibility of remote execution of arbitrary code,
information disclosure, or Denial of Service. Many of the
vulnerabilities can only be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start
applications and java applets. Please reference the CVEs listed for
specific details.

### Impact

Remote attackers may remotely execute arbitrary code, compromise
information, or cause Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

IcedTea 7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-7.2.6.4"

```

IcedTea bin 7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-7.2.6.4"

```

IcedTea 6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-6.1.13.9"

```

IcedTea bin 6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-6.1.13.9"

```

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in breakouts of
the Java sandbox, information disclosur, denial of service and insecure
cryptography.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 7u95-2.6.4-1~deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7u95-2.6.4-1~deb8u1.

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.7.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime
Environment and the OpenJDK 7 Java Software Development Kit.

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the JPEG image format decoder in
the AWT component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted JPEG image could cause
a Java application to crash or, possibly execute arbitrary code. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0483)

An integer signedness issue was found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could possibly cause
the Java Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, allowing an untrusted
Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2016-0494)

It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK did not properly
enforce the totalEntitySizeLimit limit. An attacker able to make a Java
application process a specially crafted XML file could use this flaw to
make the application consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-0466)

A flaw was found in the way TLS 1.2 could use the MD5 hash function for
signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a TLS
handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to force a TLS connection to
use the MD5 hash function could use this flaw to conduct collision attacks
to impersonate a TLS server or an authenticated TLS client. (CVE-2015-7575)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, Networking, and JMX
components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use
these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-4871,
CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448)

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was
installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited
without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1298957#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 14:03:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the deserialization of the URL class in the Networking component of OpenJDK.  Deserialization of the specially crafted data could result in creation of the URL object with an inconsistent state.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1298906#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 12:11:01 UTC  ``` Integer signedness issues were discovered in IndicRearrangementProcessor and IndicRearrangementProcessor2 in the ICU Layout Engine.  A specially crafted font file could cause an application using ICU to parse untrusted fonts to crash and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.  ICU code is embedded the 2D component in OpenJDK and used by FontManager.  An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with Java Virtual Machine privileges and bypass Java sandbox restrictions.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1298906#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2016-01-15 12:15:44 UTC  ``` Upstream fix changes type of firstGlyph and lastGlyph from unsigned int to signed int, reverting part of the fix for [CVE-2015-4844](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4844) ([bug 1273318](show_bug.cgi?id=1273318 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-4844 ICU: missing boundary checks in layout engine (OpenJDK 2D, 8132042)")) applied as part of the previous Oct 2015 CPU:  <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/rev/dbb4e2bdfa9e#l2.15>  This change also impacts boundary checks added in the same commit, as they may be optimized out by compiler when signed types are used.  The above patch has not been applied to ICU yet, hence ICU packages are not affected.

# RHSA-2016:0055 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.8.0-oracle security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.8.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 8 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2015-7575, CVE-2015-8126, CVE-2015-8472, CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448,
CVE-2016-0466, CVE-2016-0475, CVE-2016-0483, CVE-2016-0494)

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.8.0-oracle are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 8 Update 71 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: java-1.6.0-sun security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-sun packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 6 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2015-8126, CVE-2015-8472, CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448, CVE-2016-0466,
CVE-2016-0483, CVE-2016-0494)

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.6.0-sun are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 6 Update 111 and resolve these issues.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0067)

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.6.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime
Environment and the OpenJDK 6 Java Software Development Kit.

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the JPEG image format decoder in
the AWT component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted JPEG image could cause
a Java application to crash or, possibly execute arbitrary code. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0483)

An integer signedness issue was found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could possibly cause
the Java Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, allowing an untrusted
Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2016-0494)

It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK did not properly
enforce the totalEntitySizeLimit limit. An attacker able to make a Java
application process a specially crafted XML file could use this flaw to
make the application consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-0466)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the Networking and JMX components in
OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to
bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448)

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

## Description

The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime
Environment and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit.

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the JPEG image format decoder in
the AWT component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted JPEG image could cause
a Java application to crash or, possibly execute arbitrary code. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0483)

An integer signedness issue was found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could possibly cause
the Java Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, allowing an untrusted
Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2016-0494)

It was discovered that the password-based encryption (PBE) implementation
in the Libraries component in OpenJDK used an incorrect key length. This
could, in certain cases, lead to generation of keys that were weaker than
expected. (CVE-2016-0475)

It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK did not properly
enforce the totalEntitySizeLimit limit. An attacker able to make a Java
application process a specially crafted XML file could use this flaw to
make the application consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-0466)

A flaw was found in the way TLS 1.2 could use the MD5 hash function for
signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a TLS
handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to force a TLS connection to
use the MD5 hash function could use this flaw to conduct collision attacks
to impersonate a TLS server or an authenticated TLS client. (CVE-2015-7575)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the Networking and JMX components in
OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to
bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448)

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.8.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1291312#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-12-14 14:42:48 UTC  ``` An underflow read was found in png_check_keyword in pngwutil.c in libpng-1.2.54:  If the data of "key" is only ' ' (0x20), it will read a byte before the buffer in line 1288.  This issue impacts upstream versions 1.2.55, 1.0.65, 1.4.18, and 1.5.25 of libpng.  An attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause an out-of-bounds read by tricking an unsuspecting user into processing a specially crafted PNG image.

Only reading a PNG file should not be enough to trigger this. Since this is a library, it's hard to predict the exact criticality, as it depends on the application using it. For the most common scenarios, this should not be a major problem, it'll probably not even lead to a crash.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1291312#c10)  Fedora Update System    2015-12-28 22:56:11 UTC  ``` libpng10-1.0.66-1.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

I'll try to fix it asap. Please provide me with any info you think might help. Specifically, what are  your USE flags?  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-12 12:36:22 UTC  ``` I'm sorry I haven't paid this any attention for so long.

A grep rpm of the full koffice sources has no results. Let's try to track this down...1. If you haven't yet, try remerging rpm and then koffice.2. Try searching for "rpm" in your own koffice sources (/var/tmp/portage/koffice-1.1.1/work/koffice-1.1.1). ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mark Moss    2002-02-14 21:32:58 UTC  ``` I grepped the work directory (as it appears immediatly after failing) and couldn't find "librpm" or "lrpm" in any of the ASCII files (It does show up in a shared library in  work/koffice-1.1.1/kchart/kdchart/.libs/).  I dug around a little bin in work/koffice-1.1.1/qt3stuff/Makefile, and it appears the offending /usr/lib/librpm.so comes from the ${LIBPNG} from "LIB_QT = -lqt $(LIBPNG) $(LIBJPEG) -lxext $(LIB_X11) $(LIBSM)" on line 154 of the work/koffice-1.1.1/qt3stuff/Makefile.   When I remove $(LIBPNG), /usr/lib/librpm.so disappears from the command line.  If I replace $(LIBPNG) with -lpng -lm -lz (which $(LIBPNG) is defined as on line 121 of the makefile), /usr/lib/librpm.so returns.  I couldn't find anything else in the makefile which would explain where /usr/lib/librpm.so is coming from (but then again, I'm not exacltly a makefile guru...). ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-15 07:36:28 UTC  ``` My Makefile looks exactly the same as the one you describe - libpng = -lpng -lm -lz etc. I'm at a loss to understand where the librpm thing could be coming from.  I'm afraid I;ve run out of ideas to diagnose this, so let's just try to fix it (since there've been no other reports). Unmerge rpm, remerge libpng, and try to emere koffice again. Hopefully it won't pull librpm in anymore. If it works, merge rpm again.  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Mark Moss    2002-02-15 21:38:59 UTC  ``` I unmerged rpm and libpng and then remerged libpng, and the /usr/bin/librpm.so in the compiler command line went away.  I remerged rpm and was then able to merge koffice successfully.  (There was no change when I unmerged and remerged librpm yesterday.) I don't have any idea why compilation succeeds now, though. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-16 04:21:13 UTC  ``` This looks like one of those one-time bugs which go away if you remerge the right thing, and are very  difficult to track down. Glad we're done with it; I'm closing the bug.  ``` |  |

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-0483 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0483)

#### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u105, 7u91, and 8u66; Java SE Embedded 8u65; and JRockit R28.3.8 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to AWT. NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this is a heap-based buffer overflow in the readImage function, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted image data.

# RHSA-2016:0056 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.7.0-oracle security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 7 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2015-7575, CVE-2015-8126, CVE-2015-8472, CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448,
CVE-2016-0466, CVE-2016-0483, CVE-2016-0494)

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.7.0-oracle are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 7 Update 95 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in breakouts of
the Java sandbox, information disclosur, denial of service and insecure
cryptography.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b38-1.13.10-1~deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.

## Topic

Updated java-1.8.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime
Environment and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit.

An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the JPEG image format decoder in
the AWT component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted JPEG image could cause
a Java application to crash or, possibly execute arbitrary code. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0483)

An integer signedness issue was found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could possibly cause
the Java Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, allowing an untrusted
Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2016-0494)

It was discovered that the password-based encryption (PBE) implementation
in the Libraries component in OpenJDK used an incorrect key length. This
could, in certain cases, lead to generation of keys that were weaker than
expected. (CVE-2016-0475)

It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK did not properly
enforce the totalEntitySizeLimit limit. An attacker able to make a Java
application process a specially crafted XML file could use this flaw to
make the application consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-0466)

A flaw was found in the way TLS 1.2 could use the MD5 hash function for
signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a TLS
handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to force a TLS connection to
use the MD5 hash function could use this flaw to conduct collision attacks
to impersonate a TLS server or an authenticated TLS client. (CVE-2015-7575)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the Networking and JMX components in
OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to
bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448)

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was
installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited
without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.8.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
