Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0111:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF) in the `MSHTML!CSVGHelpers::SetAttributeStringAndPointer` function within the MSHTML (Microsoft HTML) engine. This occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free: The vulnerability is triggered when a freed memory location is accessed, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the browser.
- System Compromise: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Specially crafted web pages: An attacker can host a malicious web page designed to exploit the UAF vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements to exploit the vulnerability.
- Social Engineering: Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious page through email, instant messages, or by opening malicious attachments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host or inject malicious content into a website
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious page.
- No special privileges are required from the attacker, the code execution will happen with the user's privilege.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer and Edge handle objects in memory.
- The vulnerability affects both Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers.
