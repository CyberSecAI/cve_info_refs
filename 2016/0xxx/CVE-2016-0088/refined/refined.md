    "vulnerability": "Remote code execution due to insufficient input validation.",
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the host operating system.",
     "attackVector": "An authenticated attacker on a guest operating system must run a specially crafted application that causes the Hyper-V host operating system to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker requires an authenticated user account on a guest operating system running on a vulnerable Hyper-V host.",
