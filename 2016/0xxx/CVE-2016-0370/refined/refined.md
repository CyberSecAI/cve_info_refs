- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An administrator can build an application using IBM Forms Experience Builder that could expose a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to various impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection of users to malicious sites. The CVSS vector indicates a low impact on confidentiality, a low impact on integrity, and no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through an application built by an administrator, making the application itself the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to inject malicious script through an application built by an admin. An administrator with access to application building capabilities would be required to introduce the vulnerability in an application.
