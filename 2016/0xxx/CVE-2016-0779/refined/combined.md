# Apache TomEE Security Vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in maintenance releases or interim builds of Apache TomEE 1.x.
Each vulnerability is given a security impact rating by either the Apache TomEE team or by the dependent project supplying the fix - please note that this rating is not uniform and will vary from project to project.
We also list the versions of Apache TomEE the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

|  | Vulnerabilities that are not TomEE vulnerabilities but have either been incorrectly reported against TomEE or where TomEE provides a workaround are listed bellow in the section "Not a vulnerability". |
| --- | --- |

Please note that binary patches are never provided.
If you need to apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the Apache TomEE version that you are using.
For TomEE 1.x those are [Building TomEE from source](/dev/building-from-source.html).

If you need help on building or configuring TomEE or other help on following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed here, please send your questions to the public [Users mailing list](../support.html)

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other unexpected behaviour that has security impact, or if the descriptions here are incomplete, please report them privately to the [Apache Security Team](http://www.apache.org/security).
Thank you.

## Fixed in Apache TomEE 7.0.1

* [3C45A20804-ABFF-4FED-A297-69AC95AB9A3F@apache.org](http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201606.mbox/%25%3Ca%20href%3D)%3E">CVE-2016-3092 Apache Tomcat Denial of Service

## Fixed in Apache TomEE 7.0.0-M3 and 1.7.4

TomEE was subject until versions 1.7.3 and 7.0.0-M1 included to the 0-day vulnerability.
Note that even if fixed in 7.0.0-M2 we recommand you to upgrade to the 7.0.0-M3 which includes a better fix for that (better defaults).

This issue only affects you if you rely on EJBd protocol (proprietary remote EJB protocol).
This one one is not activated by default on the 7.x series but it was on the 1.x ones.

The related CVE numbers are:

* [CVE-2016-0779](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0779): The EJBd protocol provided by TomEE can exploit the 0-day vulnerability.
* [CVE-2015-8581](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8581): The EjbObjectInputStream class in Apache TomEE allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a serialized Java stream.

This has been fixed in commit 58cdbbef9c77ab2b44870f9d606593b49cde76d9.

Check [properties configuration](/properties-listing.html) and [Ejbd transport](/ejbd-transport.html) for more details (tomee.serialization.class.\* and tomee.remote.support).

# Advisory Details

December 14th, 2015
## (0Day) Apache TomEE Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-638ZDI-CAN-2929

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-8581](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-8581) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Apache |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [TomEE](http://tomee.apache.org/apache-tomee.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apache TomEE. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the EjbObjectInputStream which accepts and deserializes any Java serialized binary stream. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.  05/20/2015 - ZDI disclosed vulnerability details to the vendor. ZDI received no reply at that time.09/28/2015 - ZDI requested an update from the vendor.09/30/2015 - The vendor confirmed they had received the report, but they could not provide a status.10/03/2015 - ZDI again requested any update from the vendor.10/14/2015 - ZDI indicated the intent to move the case to 0-day in late Nov.10/14 - 17/2015 - The vendor asked some questions about the report and requested an additional file.10/16 - 19/2015 - ZDI responded and provided evidence.11/09/2015 - ZDI requested an update from the vendor and indicated the intent to move the case to 0-day in late Nov.12/10/2015 - ZDI saw an update to the product and re-tested. However, the software remains vulnerable.  -- Mitigation:  Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. |
