Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of the EJBd protocol in Apache TomEE, which is susceptible to a deserialization of untrusted data issue. Specifically, the `EjbObjectInputStream` class is the vulnerable component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The `EjbObjectInputStream` class accepts and deserializes arbitrary Java serialized binary streams without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
- **EJBd Protocol Exposure:** The EJBd protocol itself is vulnerable, and it was enabled by default in TomEE 1.x series.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Apache TomEE instance. The code is executed under the context of the TomEE process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **EJBd Protocol:** The EJBd protocol is the specific attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable TomEE server to send malicious serialized data.
- **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by cpnrodzc7 working with HPâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
- The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) publicly disclosed the vulnerability without a patch due to the vendor's slow response.
- The vulnerability is related to CVE-2015-8581, which points to the insecure deserialization in the `EjbObjectInputStream` class.
- Mitigation involves restricting access to the EJBd protocol to trusted machines using firewall rules or whitelisting.
- The vulnerability affects Apache TomEE versions up to 1.7.3 and 7.0.0-M1. It was fixed in 7.0.0-M3 and 1.7.4.
- Configuration options `tomee.serialization.class.*` and `tomee.remote.support` are relevant to the vulnerability and should be reviewed.
