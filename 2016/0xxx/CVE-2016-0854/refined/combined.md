### Advantech WebAccess Dashboard Viewer uploadImageCommon Arbitrary File Upload

Disclosed
02/05/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability found in Advantech WebAccess 8.0.
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations
of Advantech WebAccess. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
The specific flaw exists within the WebAccess Dashboard Viewer. Insufficient validation within
the uploadImageCommon function in the UploadAjaxAction script allows unauthenticated callers to
upload arbitrary code (instead of an image) to the server, which will then be executed under the
high-privilege context of the IIS AppPool.

#### Author(s)

* rgod
* Zhou Yu <504137480@qq.com>
* sinn3r <sinn3r@metasploit.com>

#### Platform

Windows

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/scada/advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload
msf exploit(advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(advantech_webaccess_dashboard_file_upload) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

         This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability found in Advantech WebAccess 8.0.

         This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations
         of Advantech WebAccess. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

         The specific flaw exists within the WebAccess Dashboard Viewer. Insufficient validation within
         the uploadImageCommon function in the UploadAjaxAction script allows unauthenticated callers to
         upload arbitrary code (instead of an image) to the server, which will then be executed under the
         high-privilege context of the IIS AppPool.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

ICS Advisory
# Advantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-014-01

## OVERVIEW

Ilya Karpov of Positive Technologies, Ivan Sanchez, Andrea Micalizzi, Ariele Caltabiano, Fritz Sands, Steven Seeley, and an anonymous researcher have identified multiple vulnerabilities in Advantech WebAccess application. Many of these vulnerabilities were reported through the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and iDefense. Advantech has produced a new version to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Ivan Sanchez has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities which he reported.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Advantech reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of WebAccess:

* WebAccess Version 8.0 and prior versions.

## IMPACT

An attacker who exploits these vulnerabilities may be able to upload, create, or delete arbitrary files on the target system, deny access to valid users, or remotely execute arbitrary code.

## MITIGATION

Advantech has released a new version of WebAccess, Version 8.1, to address the reported vulnerabilities. This new version is available on the Advantech website at the following location:

<http://www.advantech.com/industrial-automation/webaccess>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at[http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
