Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-0402:

**CVE-2016-0402 - OpenJDK: URL deserialization inconsistencies (Networking, 8059054)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from inconsistencies in how the `URL` class in the Networking component of OpenJDK handles deserialization. Specifically, it's possible to create a `URL` object with an inconsistent state by providing specially crafted data during deserialization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Inconsistent URL object state after deserialization.
    *   Improper handling of crafted data during deserialization.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An untrusted Java application or applet could potentially exploit this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.
    *   This could lead to unauthorized access, modification of resources, or arbitrary code execution (depending on what the attacker manages to do with the inconsistent state).

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks targeting Java applications or applets that perform URL deserialization of untrusted input.
    *   Malicious websites hosting malicious applets that exploit this flaw when visited by a user with a vulnerable Java plugin.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted data that will be deserialized into a URL object.
    *   The target system needs to be running a vulnerable version of OpenJDK and an application or applet that performs URL deserialization on untrusted input.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in versions 6u105, 7u91, and 8u66 of Oracle Java SE, and Java SE Embedded 8u65.
*   The bug is fixed in Oracle Java SE 6u111, 7u95, and 8u71.
*   Red Hat has addressed this in multiple advisories (RHSA-2016:0049, RHSA-2016:0050, etc) which patch the affected OpenJDK and Oracle Java packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   SUSE has addressed the issue in several advisories (SUSE-SU-2016:0256-1, SUSE-SU-2016:0265-1, etc) for their respective products.
*   Gentoo has released GLSA 201603-14 to fix the vulnerability on its platform.
*   Ubuntu addressed this in USN-2884-1 and USN-2885-1.
*   The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the URL class within the networking component of OpenJDK.

This CVE primarily focuses on how a specifically crafted URL is deserialized resulting in an inconsistent state which then is used to bypass security restrictions.
