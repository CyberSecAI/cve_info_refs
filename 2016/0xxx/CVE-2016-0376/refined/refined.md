  "CVE-2016-0376": {
    "description": "The com.ibm.rmi.io.SunSerializableFactory class in IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition 6 before SR16 FP25 (6.0.16.25), 6 R1 before SR8 FP25 (6.1.8.25), 7 before SR9 FP40 (7.0.9.40), 7 R1 before SR3 FP40 (7.1.3.40), and 8 before SR3 (8.0.3.0) does not properly deserialize classes in an AccessController doPrivileged block, which allows remote attackers to bypass a sandbox protection mechanism and execute arbitrary code as demonstrated by the readValue method of the com.ibm.rmi.io.ValueHandlerPool.ValueHandlerSingleton class, which implements the javax.rmi.CORBA.ValueHandler interface. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-5456.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper deserialization of classes within an AccessController doPrivileged block in the com.ibm.rmi.io.SunSerializableFactory class. This occurs when the constructor of the first non-serializable superclass is invoked inside the doPrivileged block.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization of arbitrary classes.",
        "Missing security checks on code paths that can reach the vulnerable code sequence."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass sandbox protection mechanisms and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows code running under a security manager to elevate its privileges by modifying or removing the security manager.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker. Requires the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path, and craft a malicious serialized object to exploit the deserialization flaw. Exploitable through a variety of code paths.",
