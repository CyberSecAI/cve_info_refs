**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=555

It is possible for an attacker to execute a DLL planting attack in Microsoft Office 2010 on Windows 7 x86 with a specially crafted OLE object. The attached POC document "planted-mfplat.doc" contains what was originally an embedded Packager object. The CLSID for this object was changed at offset 0x2650 to be {62dc1a93-ae24-464c-a43e-452f824c4250} (formatted as pack(">IHHBBBBBBBB")) which is one of several registered objects that have an InProcServer32 of WMALFXGFXDSP.dll. Other options include:

{637c490d-eee3-4c0a-973f-371958802da2}
{874131cb-4ecc-443b-8948-746b89595d20}
{96749377-3391-11D2-9EE3-00C04F797396}

When a user opens this document and single clicks on the icon for foo.txt ole32!OleLoad is invoked on our vulnerable CLSID. This results in a call to wmalfxgfxdsp!DllGetClassObject() which does a LoadLibraryW() call for "mfplat". If the attached mfplat.dll is placed in the same directory with the planted-mfplat.doc file you should see a popup coming from this DLL being loaded from the current working directory of Word.

Here is the call stack leading up to the vulnerable LoadLibraryW() call:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple DLL Loading Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Windows improperly validates input before loading dynamic link library (DLL) files. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could elevate their privileges on a targeted system.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the target system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control over an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows validates input before loading DLL files.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DLL Loading Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0014](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0014) | No | No |
| MAPI DLL Loading Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0020](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0020) | No | No |

## DirectShow Heap Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0015

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when [Microsoft DirectShow](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) improperly validates user input. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to execute in the context of the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

For an attack to be successful, this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted link to the user and by convincing the user to open it. The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how DirectShow validates user input.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Security Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0019

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that is caused when Windows 10 hosts running RDP services fail to prevent remote logon to accounts that have no passwords set. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to the remote host as another user, possibly with elevated privileges.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an older version of the RDP client to connect to the Windows 10 host. Once connected, the attacker could generate a list of user accounts on the host and attempt to log on as those users. If one of the user accounts has no password set, then the attacker is allowed to log on as that user, despite the default system setting that restricts access to accounts without passwords to local logon only. The security update addresses the vulnerability by enforcing the default setting of not allowing remote logon for accounts without passwords.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
