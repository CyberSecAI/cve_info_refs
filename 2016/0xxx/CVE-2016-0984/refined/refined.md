### Summary of CVE-2016-0984
Based on the provided documents, CVE-2016-0984 is a use-after-free vulnerability present in Adobe Flash Player.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a dangling pointer within the `loadPCMFromByteArray` function. When this function is called with specific parameters, it can deallocate memory associated with a pointer, but a subsequent exception prevents the pointer from being reset. This results in a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- A dangling pointer is created due to an exception not properly handling memory cleanup
- The `extract` method could be used to access the deallocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution is possible with the privileges of the process.
- A denial of service (DoS) can be caused by accessing the freed memory.
- Sensitive information could be exposed by reading from the freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation can occur through specially crafted SWF files.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the victim loads a page containing the malicious SWF content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SWF file to the victim, which would then be processed by a vulnerable Adobe Flash Player instance.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to induce the loading of a malicious SWF in the user's browser.
- User interaction is required, as a user must visit a malicious web page or open a malicious SWF file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is found in Adobe Flash Player versions prior to 18.0.0.329, 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.306 on Windows and OS X, and before 11.2.202.569 on Linux, as well as in Adobe AIR and AIR SDK.
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling `loadPCMFromByteArray` with a specific array length that triggers an exception during byte array reading, leading to the dangling pointer.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
- The `sound.extract` method can read from the dangling pointer, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "critical" severity by SUSE and Red Hat.
- The vulnerability affects multiple platforms including Linux, Windows and OS X.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with a malformed byte array to the `loadPCMFromByteArray` function.
