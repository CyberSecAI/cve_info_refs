Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Apache Struts framework performing a double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags. When raw user input is used in tag attributes, the framework can be forced to evaluate these inputs twice, leading to potential security risks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Forced Double OGNL Evaluation:** The core vulnerability is the framework's susceptibility to forced double evaluation of OGNL expressions within tag attributes. This allows attackers to inject malicious OGNL expressions that are evaluated twice.
- **Unvalidated User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when user-supplied input is directly used within tag attributes without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Struts application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious OGNL Expression Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious OGNL expressions into tag attributes that are then evaluated twice by the Struts framework.
- **Raw User Input:** The attack vector relies on the framework using unvalidated user-supplied data directly in tag attributes, creating a pathway for injected malicious OGNL expressions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide User Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application that is subsequently used as a tag attribute value.
- **Understanding of OGNL:** Knowledge of OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) is required to craft malicious expressions that will execute code on the server during the double evaluation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Struts versions 2.0.0 to 2.3.24.1 (excluding 2.3.20.3).
- Mitigation strategies include validating user-supplied data, avoiding forced evaluation with `%{...}` in tag attributes (except for the `value` attribute), or upgrading to Struts versions 2.3.20.3, 2.3.24.3, or 2.3.28.
- A workaround for older versions involves redefining `struts.excludedClasses` to block access to potentially dangerous classes.
