Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-0344

**Description:** The IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack within the "My Reports" feature.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling user-supplied data within the "My Reports" functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed within the context of a user's browser when they access the "My Reports" section.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Stealing of user session cookies, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the application's interface.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker would need to inject malicious script via the vulnerable "My Reports" feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to have the ability to submit input to the "My Reports" feature within the IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform. This implies they would likely need to be a legitimate user of the application, or be able to inject input via other means.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.5
*   IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.4
*   IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.3

**Fixes:**
*   IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.5.0.1
*   IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.4.2.3
*   IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.3.2.6
