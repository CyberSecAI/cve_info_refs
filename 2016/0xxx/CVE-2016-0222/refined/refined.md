- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to view work logs during purchase orders that they should not have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control allows unauthorized viewing of work logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can view sensitive work log information related to purchase orders they should not have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access through the application's interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application.
