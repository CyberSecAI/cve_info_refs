  "CVE-2016-0791": {
    "Description": "The verification of user-provided CSRF crumbs with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm, potentially allowing attackers to use statistical methods to determine valid CSRF crumbs using brute-force methods.",
    "Root cause": "Non-constant time comparison of CSRF crumbs",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The verification of user-provided CSRF crumbs with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm."
     ],
    "Impact": "Attackers could potentially use statistical methods to determine valid CSRF crumbs using brute-force methods.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An unprivileged attacker with the ability to send requests to the Jenkins server.",
