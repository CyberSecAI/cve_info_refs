- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a weakness in how IBM Control Center handles password encryption and decryption, allowing for the decryption of the master key under specific conditions. This master key can then be used to decrypt application passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure storage of master key
    - Vulnerable password decryption mechanism
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to decrypt the master key, which leads to the decryption of application passwords, leading to unauthorized access and potentially further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must satisfy special conditions to exploit the vulnerability.
