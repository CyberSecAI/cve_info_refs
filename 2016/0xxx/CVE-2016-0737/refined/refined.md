{
  "CVE-2016-0737": {
    "Root cause": "A memory-leak issue exists in OpenStack Object Storage (swift) during client-to-proxy connections.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "An OpenStack-authenticated attacker can trigger this flaw remotely, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive memory consumption.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability is triggered via a client-to-proxy connection by repeatedly requesting and interrupting connections to a Large Object (Dynamic or Static) URL.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be OpenStack-authenticated and able to make requests to the OpenStack Object Storage (swift) proxy."
