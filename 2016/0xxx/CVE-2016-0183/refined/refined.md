**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows font library improperly handling specially crafted embedded fonts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of embedded fonts within the Windows font library leads to a remote code execution vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

   - An attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability
   - The attacker would need to convince the user to open this file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious website or document file containing a specially crafted embedded font.
- The attacker also needs to convince the victim to open the malicious document or visit the malicious webpage.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a **Critical** Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the context of the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-054
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts.
