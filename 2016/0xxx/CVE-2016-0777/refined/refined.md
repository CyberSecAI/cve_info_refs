Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-0777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an information leak in the OpenSSH client's experimental support for resuming connections (roaming). Specifically, the `resend_bytes` function in `roaming_common.c` has a flaw that can be exploited by a malicious server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Leak:** A malicious server can trick the OpenSSH client into leaking sensitive information from its memory, including private keys. This occurs because the server controls the `out_buf_size` and can cause the client to transmit uninitialized memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** A compromised or malicious server can potentially obtain sensitive information from the client's memory, such as private SSH keys, memory addresses, etc. This can lead to further attacks like impersonation, access to sensitive systems, etc.
-   **Private Key Disclosure:**  Attackers can exploit this to steal the client's private SSH keys (or parts thereof), particularly if keys are not passphrase-protected.
-   Passphrase-encrypted keys may be leaked in encrypted form, potentially vulnerable to offline cracking

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Man-in-the-middle (MITM):** Although a MITM attacker could attempt to inject the malicious handshake, it is less likely without breaking host authentication or integrity protection.
-   **Malicious Server:** The primary attack vector is a malicious server, or a trusted but compromised server.
-   **User Interaction:** While not mandatory for exploitation, user interaction may trigger the vulnerable code due to the way `wait_for_roaming_reconnect()` operates, for instance, through a connection being suspended and resumed, or when standard input and output are used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Malicious Server Control:** The attacker must control or compromise an SSH server to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Network Reachability:** The attacker needs network reachability to the vulnerable client.
-   **Knowledge/Manipulation of the Roaming Feature**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the vulnerable roaming feature to achieve exploitation by:
    *   Offering the key exchange algorithm `resume@appgate.com`.
    *   Accepting the global request `roaming@appgate.com`.
    *   Controlling the size of `out_buf_size` via `packet_get_int() + get_snd_buf_size()`.
    *   Controlling the `offset` in `resend_bytes()`, such that it forces all of `out_buf` to be leaked.

**Additional Technical Details:**

-   The vulnerability exists in the experimental roaming feature of the OpenSSH client. This feature is enabled by default in affected versions, despite the lack of server-side support in OpenSSH itself.
-   The information leak is caused by the way the `resend_bytes()` function calculates the amount of data to resend during a reconnection.
-   The `out_buf` is allocated using `malloc()` and not `calloc()`, which could lead to the return of memory containing leaked sensitive information if heap massaging is performed by the attacker.
-   The vulnerability affects OpenSSH clients versions 5.4 to 7.1.
-   The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the `UseRoaming` option in the client's configuration (e.g., `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, `~/.ssh/config`, or `-oUseRoaming=no` on the command line).
-   OpenSSH version 7.1p2 and later disables roaming by default.

**CVE-2016-0777 vs CVE-2016-0778**

-   While CVE-2016-0777 covers the information leak leading to private key disclosure, CVE-2016-0778 refers to a buffer overflow in the same OpenSSH client's roaming feature.
