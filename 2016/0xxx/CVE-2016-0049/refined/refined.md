Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-0049:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure in the Kerberos authentication process to properly check password changes when a user logs into a workstation.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
The core weakness is a security feature bypass in the Kerberos authentication protocol. Specifically, it does not validate password changes correctly when a user signs into a workstation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass Kerberos authentication. This bypass can lead to the decryption of drives protected by BitLocker, and potentially other impacts associated with gaining unauthorized access to a system.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker needs to connect a workstation to a malicious Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). This requires network access to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target machine or the ability to spoof the network such that they can intercept Kerberos related traffic.
2. **Network access:** The attacker needs to establish a network connection between the target system and a malicious Domain Controller.
3.  **Malicious KDC:** The attacker must set up a malicious Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).
4.  **Domain User:** A domain user must have logged into the target machine.
5. **BitLocker Enabled:** The target system must have BitLocker enabled without a PIN or USB key for full exploit impact.

**Additional details from exploit-db.com:**
* **Steps to Reproduce:** The provided content details steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability by setting up a malicious domain controller, creating a user, forcing a password change, and then using the newly changed password offline to gain access.
* **Impact:** The impact is access to information stored on the Full Disk Encrypted (FDE) system without prior knowledge of the password.
* **Solution:** The solution is to install the security patches from 09-02-2016.
* **Mitigation:** Disabling cached domain logons is mentioned as a workaround but also has its own impact (Users will not be able to log on without being connected to the network).

In summary, the vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Kerberos authentication by manipulating the KDC, potentially leading to unauthorized access and decryption of BitLocker-protected drives. The attack requires specific conditions like physical access, a malicious KDC setup, a domain user having logged on, and BitLocker being enabled without a PIN or USB key. The identified workaround comes with the drawback of needing a network connection for domain logons.
