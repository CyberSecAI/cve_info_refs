**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper sanitization of values
- Information disclosure due to a failure to sanitize data when copying a structure to userland.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information leak: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to leak sensitive information in the context of SYSTEM.
- This information disclosure could be leveraged for further exploitation such as KASLR bypass according to the Microsoft bulletin.
- Could lead to further compromise like elevation of privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: A local attacker needs to log on to the affected system.
- User interaction is required. The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the target machine.
- Ability to execute code on the target machine.

**Additional Notes:**
