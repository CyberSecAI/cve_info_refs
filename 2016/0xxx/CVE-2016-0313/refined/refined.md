- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website, potentially leading to the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially-crafted URL that, when clicked by a victim, triggers the execution of malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and induce a victim to click on it. The attacker doesn't need prior authentication.
