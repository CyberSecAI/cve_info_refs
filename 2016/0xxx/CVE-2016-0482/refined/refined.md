Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-0482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `DownloadServlet` servlet of the Oracle Application Testing Suite.
- It is due to insufficient validation of the `file` parameter, which allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The `file` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory structure.
- **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the directory traversal, an attacker can access and retrieve arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read any file accessible to the user running the Oracle Application Testing Suite. This may lead to the exposure of sensitive configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `DownloadServlet`.
- **`file` parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `file` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../").
- **`downloadType` parameter:** The `downloadType` parameter needs to be set to `subReport` for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to the application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable servlet:** The attacker needs to know the endpoint of `DownloadServlet` and the required parameter values.

**Additional Details:**
- Oracle released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID '21201'.
- The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on 2015-09-29, and a coordinated public release was done on 2016-01-25.
