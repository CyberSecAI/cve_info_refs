 /*
    This is a proof of concept for CVE-2016-0801 Bug
    the program proceeds as follows:
    o  A new WPS Probe Response packet is generated.
    o  The device_name field of this packet is filled with some string that's longer than hundered characters.
    o  This packet is broadcasted on the network( interface needs to be on monitor mode for this to work).
    At this point the device picking up this packet, identified by its mac address(DESTINATION_MAC), should have crashed.

    the following patch shows how contributor fixed the bug

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nexus Security Bulletin - February 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published February 01, 2016 | Updated March 7, 2016*

We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the
[Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images).
Builds LMY49G or later and Android M with Security Patch Level of February 1,
2016 or later address these issues. Refer to the
[Nexus documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705)
for instructions on how to check the security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on January 4,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have been
released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability in Broadcom’s Wi-Fi driver is also Critical severity as
it could allow remote code execution on an affected device while connected to
the same network as the attacker. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the [Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.

### Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and
service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.* The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
    SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
    installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
    users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
    enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
    Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
    applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
    application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
    attempt to remove any such applications.* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
      pass media to processes such as mediaserver.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the firmware for
Broadcom BCM43xx wifi chips that may lead to a privilege escalation
or loss of confidentiality.

CVE-2016-0801

    Broadgate Team discovered flaws in packet processing in the
    Broadcom wifi firmware and proprietary drivers that could lead to
    remote code execution.  However, this vulnerability is not
    believed to affect the drivers used in Debian.

CVE-2017-0561

    Gal Beniamini of Project Zero discovered a flaw in the TDLS
    implementation in Broadcom wifi firmware.  This could be exploited
    by an attacker on the same WPA2 network to execute code on the
    wifi microcontroller.

CVE-2017-9417 / #869639

    Nitay Artenstein of Exodus Intelligence discovered a flaw in the
    WMM implementation in Broadcom wifi firmware.  This could be
    exploited by a nearby attacker to execute code on the wifi
    microcontroller.

CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080,
CVE-2017-13081

    Mathy Vanhoef of the imec-DistriNet research group of KU Leuven
    discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the WPA protocol used for
    authentication in wireless networks, dubbed "KRACK".

    An attacker exploiting the vulnerabilities could force the
    vulnerable system to reuse cryptographic session keys, enabling a
    range of cryptographic attacks against the ciphers used in WPA1
    and WPA2.

    These vulnerabilities are only being fixed for certain Broadcom
    wifi chips, and might still be present in firmware for other wifi
    hardware.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
20161130-4~deb8u1.  This version also adds new firmware and packages
for use with Linux 4.9, and re-adds firmware-{adi,ralink} as
transitional packages.

We recommend that you upgrade your firmware-nonfree packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
