- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities exist in Internet Explorer due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerabilities that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, install software, modify data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. Users can be lured to view the malicious page via email, instant messages, or compromised websites with malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host or inject the malicious content into a website that a targeted user is likely to visit. The attacker also needs to convince the user to view this content through social engineering.
