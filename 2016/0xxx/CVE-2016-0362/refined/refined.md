- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM TRIRIGA platform allows remote attackers to use one of its web services as a proxy to forward HTTP requests to other internal/external Web resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unintended proxy or intermediary vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can use the vulnerable web service as a proxy to forward HTTP requests to other internal or external web resources. This can potentially allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions, access internal resources, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the web services functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web service.
