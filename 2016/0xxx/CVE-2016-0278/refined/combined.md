# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0090

## IBM Domino KeyView PDF Filter Stream Length Code Execution Vulnerability

##### June 8, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-0278

### Description

An integer overflow vulnerability present in the PDF filter of KeyView as used by
Domino can lead to process crash and possible arbitrary code execution.

### Tested Versions

* KeyView 10.16 as used by IBM Domino 9.0.1

### Product URLs

http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibmdomino

### Details

An improper check on `Length` parameter of a compressed PDF stream can result in an integer
overflow leading to an unbounded `memcpy` call.

Shortened test case triggering the vulnerability can be summarized as follows:

```
%PDF-1.6
47 0 obj
<<   /Filter/ASCIIHexDecode    /Length 2147483647/Root 41 0 R/Size 60/Type/XRef >>stream
414141414141
endstream
>>
endobj
16
%%EOF

```

In the above test case the length value is specified to be exactly 2147483647 or 0x7fffffff in hex,
which is the biggest positive value of a 32bit integer. String value of length is converted into
an integer by calling `strtol` function (base address of pdfsr.so being 0xB79BA000):

```
.text:B79F3343 mov     dword ptr [esp+0Ch], 0 ; group
.text:B79F334B mov     dword ptr [esp+8], 0Ah ; base
.text:B79F3353 mov     dword ptr [esp+4], 0 ; endptr
.text:B79F335B mov     edx, [ebp+var_948]
.text:B79F3361 mov     [esp], edx      ; nptr
.text:B79F3364 call    ___strtol_internal
.text:B79F3369 test    eax, eax
.text:B79F336B js      loc_B79F464A

```

If a string representing an integer supplied to `strtol` is equal to 2147483647 or bigger, `strtol`
will return 0x7fffffff. The integer overflow happens later in the code, when the parser specifically
checks if the destination buffer for faulting `memcpy` call is bug enough to hold the source buffer:

```
.text:B79F4314 mov     ecx, [ebp+n]	   ; n is the value returned by strtol
.text:B79F431A add     ecx, 1          ; here's where the integer overflow happens
.text:B79F431D mov     [ebp+var_920], ecx
.text:B79F4323 mov     edi, [ebp+var_93C]
.text:B79F4329 cmp     ecx, [edi+0Ch]  ; edi+0xC is size of the destination buffer, by default 0x2000
.text:B79F432C jl      short loc_B79F436C

```

An integer overflow happens above when 1 is added to the length value, the result being 0x80000000.
A signed comparison is made with 0x2000 and the jump will be successful. Parser concludes that the destination buffer is big enough and proceeds to call `memcpy` with the original length value (0x7fffffff):

```
.text:B79F436C loc_B79F436C:
.text:B79F436C mov     edi, [ebp+n]
.text:B79F4372 mov     ecx, [ebp+var_93C]
.text:B79F4378 mov     [ecx+8], edi
.text:B79F437B mov     eax, [ecx+4]
.text:B79F437E mov     [esp+8], edi    ; n
.text:B79F4382 mov     edx, [ebp+src]  ; n gets set at B79F3371
.text:B79F4388 mov     [esp+4], edx    ; src
.text:B79F438C mov     [esp], eax      ; dest
.text:B79F438F call    _memcpy
.text:B79F4394 mov     ecx, [ebp+var_984]
.text:B79F439A cmp     dword ptr [ecx+11B0h], 0
.text:B79F43A1 jz      short loc_B79F

```

The unbounded `memcpy` call will result in a process crash when it hits invalid memory.

Detection of PDF files specifically crafted to trigger this vulnerability can be based on the abnormally large stream `/Length` value in the PDF file.

The vulnerability can be triggered with the supplied test case in the `filter` standalone KeyView binary shipped with IBM Domino, or by sending it as an attachment with an email to a Domino mail server.
