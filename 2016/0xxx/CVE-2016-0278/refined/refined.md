- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the KeyView PDF filter due to an improper check on the `Length` parameter of a compressed PDF stream. Specifically, when processing the stream length, a value of `2147483647` (0x7fffffff), is incremented, resulting in `0x80000000`. This signed integer overflow bypasses the buffer size check, leading to a `memcpy` call with the original length value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to unbounded memory copy (`memcpy`). Lack of proper input validation when handling the `Length` parameter in PDF streams.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Process crash, potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted PDF file with an extremely large `/Length` value in a compressed stream. This can be done by sending the file as an email attachment to a Domino mail server or by using the standalone KeyView binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PDF to an IBM Domino system that uses the vulnerable KeyView PDF filter, either through a mail server or by directly using the filter binary.
