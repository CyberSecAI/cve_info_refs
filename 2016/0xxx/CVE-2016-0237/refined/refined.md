- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor locally caches browser data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information can be obtained from the locally cached browser data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could potentially access sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the machine where the data is cached.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the system where the IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor is installed and where the browser data is cached.
