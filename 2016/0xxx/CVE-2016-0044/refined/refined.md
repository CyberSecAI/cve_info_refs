Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-0044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of specially crafted input by the Microsoft Sync Framework when processing "change batch" structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a denial-of-service vulnerability
- It stems from the way the Microsoft Sync Framework validates input data, specifically when handling 'change batch' structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could cause the `SyncShareSvc` service to stop responding (Denial of Service).
- It would prevent authenticated users from using the `SyncShareSvc` service.
- Note that the denial of service would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires the attacker to be authenticated.
- It involves sending a specially crafted network packet to a server running the `SyncShareSvc` service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated on the target system.
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target server.
