{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2016-0128",
    "description": "The Security Account Manager Remote (SAMR) and Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) (LSAD) protocols do not properly establish Remote Procedure Call (RPC) channels, which may allow any attacker to impersonate an authenticated user or gain access to the SAM database, or launch denial of service attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The SAMR and LSAD remote protocols accept authentication levels that do not adequately protect the RPC channel. This is caused by the way these protocols establish the RPC channel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker with network access can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to impersonate an authenticated user or gain access to the SAM database. Additionally, an attacker can use this vulnerability to launch a denial of service attack.",
    "attack_vector": "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, forcing a downgrade of the authentication level of the RPC channel.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to perform a MitM attack and be able to force a downgrade of the authentication level of the SAM and LSAD channels.",
  }
