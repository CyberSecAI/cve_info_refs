- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow in IBM WebSphere Application Server when the webcontainer custom property `HttpSessionIdReuse` is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Buffer overflow, leading to potential bypass of security restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could bypass security restrictions and potentially view unauthorized data.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the application and the `HttpSessionIdReuse` property must be enabled in the web container configuration.
