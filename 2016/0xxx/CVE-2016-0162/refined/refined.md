Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2016-0162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer's improper handling of JavaScript. This improper handling allows for an attacker to potentially detect specific files on the user's computer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to information that was not intended to be disclosed (specific files on the user's computer). This data leakage could be used to further compromise a system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could potentially read data (specific files on the user's computer) that was not intended to be disclosed.
- While it does not directly lead to code execution or privilege escalation, the disclosed information could be leveraged in subsequent attacks to further compromise the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a website specifically crafted to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept/host user-generated content.
- In all cases, the attacker has to trick the user into viewing the attacker-controlled content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website (e.g., via links in emails or instant messages).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to restrict what information is returned to Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" for Windows clients and "Low" for Windows servers, indicating a lower severity compared to Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities.
