Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from IBM Security Guardium transmitting query parameters within SSL requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Transmitting query parameters in SSL requests can expose sensitive data, as these parameters are not always encrypted within the SSL/TLS connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker could intercept the query parameters through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within the parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the IBM Security Guardium server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable IBM Security Guardium server.
- **Remote Position:** The attacker is remote and can perform a MITM attack from an external network.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as having a CVSS base score of 3.7, with a vector of `(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)`. This indicates a low impact vulnerability with a potential for data disclosure.
- The affected products and versions are IBM Security Guardium versions 9x and 10.
- Fixes are available for both affected versions via provided links.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the IBM X-Force Ethical Hacking Team.
