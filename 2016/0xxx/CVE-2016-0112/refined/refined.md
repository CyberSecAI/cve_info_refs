## Microsoft Internet Explorer CAttrArray Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

*   **Vulnerability:** Type confusion
*   **Root cause:** Internet Explorer improperly handles attributes of DOM elements, allowing an attacker to cause Internet Explorer to process a string as if it were a CAttrArray object.
*   **Attack vector:** Remote, by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute code under the context of the current process.
*   **Mitigation:** Microsoft issued an update to correct this vulnerability. Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['23707'].

## Microsoft Internet Explorer setAttribute Use-After-Free Information Disclosure Vulnerability

*   **Vulnerability:** Use-After-Free
*   **Root cause:** Internet Explorer improperly handles changes to attributes of DOM elements, allowing an attacker to cause a string allocation in memory to be reused after it has been freed.
*   **Attack vector:** Remote, by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, allowing an attacker to disclose memory contents.
*   **Mitigation:** Microsoft issued an update to correct this vulnerability. Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['23707'].

## Multiple Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** Memory Corruption
*   **Root cause:** Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Mitigation:** The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
