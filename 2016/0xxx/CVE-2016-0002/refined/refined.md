  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The VBScript engine has a memory corruption vulnerability in the way it handles objects in memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption in VBScript engine"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This could result in the attacker gaining the same rights as the current user, potentially leading to complete system control if the user has administrative rights. This control could be used to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a specially crafted website in Internet Explorer",
      "Embedding an ActiveX control marked as 'safe for initialization' in an application or Microsoft Office document hosting the IE rendering engine",
      "Exploiting compromised websites that host user-provided content or advertisements"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host or inject content that exploits the VBScript memory corruption vulnerability. The attacker must convince the victim to view this malicious content via Internet Explorer. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the victim's system prior to exploitation.",
	 "more_info": "The vulnerability is triggered when the VBScript engine renders objects in memory in a specific way. This can be triggered via a specially crafted webpage or other malicious content that uses VBScript."
