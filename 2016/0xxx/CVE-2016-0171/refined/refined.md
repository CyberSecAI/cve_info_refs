    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of objects in memory in the Windows kernel-mode driver."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, allowing them to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to log on to the target system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.",
