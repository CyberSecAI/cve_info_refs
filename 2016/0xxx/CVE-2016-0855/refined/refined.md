Based on the provided content, CVE-2016-0855 is related to multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities within the Advantech WebAccess Dashboard Viewer. There are five distinct vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-0855, each with its own attack vector:

**1. removeFile Directory Traversal Arbitrary File Deletion Denial of Service:**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation within the `removeFile` script.
*   **Vulnerability:** Directory traversal leading to arbitrary file deletion.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service by removing key system files, blocking WebAccess for all users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to the `removeFile` script without authentication.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote unauthenticated attacker.

**2. renameFolder Directory Traversal Denial of Service:**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation within the `renameFolder` script.
*  **Vulnerability:** Directory traversal leading to renaming key system directories.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service by blocking access to WebAccess functionality for all users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to the `renameFolder` script without authentication.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote unauthenticated attacker.

**3. removeFolder Directory Traversal Denial of Service:**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation within the `removeFolder` script.
*   **Vulnerability:** Directory traversal leading to removing key system directories.
*  **Impact:** Denial of service by blocking access to WebAccess functionality for all users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to the `removeFolder` script without authentication.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote unauthenticated attacker.

**4. addFolder Directory Traversal Arbitrary File Deletion Denial of Service:**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation within the `addFolder` script.
*   **Vulnerability:** Directory traversal leading to overwriting key system files.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service by blocking access to WebAccess functionality for all users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to the `addFolder` script without authentication.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote unauthenticated attacker.

**5. openWidget Directory Traversal Information Disclosure:**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation within the `openWidget` script.
*   **Vulnerability:** Directory traversal leading to arbitrary file content disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of arbitrary files on the WebAccess server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to the `openWidget` script without authentication.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote unauthenticated attacker.

The general vulnerability is a Path Traversal issue (CWE-22) where the virtual directory created by WebAccess can be browsed anonymously without authentication.

All of these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without authentication, allowing attackers to cause denial of service or information disclosure.
