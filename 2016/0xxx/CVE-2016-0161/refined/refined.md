  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2016-0161": {
      "root_cause": "Microsoft Edge does not properly validate JavaScript under specific conditions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper JavaScript Validation",
        "Elevation of Privilege"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could elevate privileges in affected versions of Microsoft Edge and then potentially leverage these elevated privileges with another vulnerability to run arbitrary code with medium integrity level privileges (permissions of the current user).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attack scenario where an attacker hosts a specially crafted website",
        "Compromised websites or sites accepting user-provided content containing malicious content"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious website. The attacker does not have a way to force a user to visit their site.",
        "more_details": "This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (for example, a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Microsoft Edge, but because of the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level. However, an attacker could then exploit this vulnerability to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level."
