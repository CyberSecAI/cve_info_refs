Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `mediaserver` component's handling of media files. Specifically, a flaw exists in how the `SoftMPEG4Encoder` and `SoftVPXEncoder` handle memory allocation, potentially leading to memory corruption during media processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core weakness is improper memory management within `SoftMPEG4Encoder` and `SoftVPXEncoder`.  The code fails to adequately validate the requested memory size before allocation. This lack of validation allows a malicious or specially crafted media file to request an arbitrarily large memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve RCE in the context of the `mediaserver` process, a critical component with access to audio/video streams and elevated privileges.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  The improper allocation leads to memory corruption in the `mediaserver` process, which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Media Files:** The vulnerability can be triggered via the processing of specially crafted media files.
*   **Multiple Applications:** This vulnerability can be reached through multiple attack vectors, including:
    *   **MMS:** Receiving malicious media via multimedia messages.
    *   **Web Browsing:** Playing specially crafted media content through the browser.
    *   **Other applications** that process media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to deliver a specially crafted media file to the target device. This could be done through network communication or any channel that allows sending media to the target device.
*   No user interaction is needed beyond initial exposure to malicious media content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit messages reveal that the fix involves checking the requested memory size before allocation for `SoftMPEG4Encoder` and `SoftVPXEncoder`.
*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** due to the potential for remote code execution within the `mediaserver` process, a high-privilege system service.

**In summary, CVE-2016-0804 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting Android's mediaserver component, caused by insufficient memory size validation when processing media using SoftMPEG4Encoder and SoftVPXEncoder. It can be exploited by sending specially crafted media files to the device.**
