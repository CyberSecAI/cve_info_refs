Specifically, when the `allow_destroy` option is false, the `_destroy` flag causes the `:reject_if` proc to be skipped, allowing unintended changes (such as setting invalid values or clearing attributes) to be applied. The severity of the vulnerability depends on how the application uses this feature and what it is protecting."
