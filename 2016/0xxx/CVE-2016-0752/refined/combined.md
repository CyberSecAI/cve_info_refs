| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 19:37:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662971](attachment.cgi?id=662971&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662971&action=edit) Do-not-unescape-already-escaped-HTML-entities.patch  EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-15  bundled in: OBS, Portus  XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer  There is a XSS vulnerability in `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` used by Action View's `strip_tags`. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7579.  Versions Affected:  1.0.2 Not affected:       1.0.0, 1.0.1 Fixed Versions:     1.0.3  Impact ------ Due to the way that `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` is implemented, if an attacker passes an already escaped HTML entity to the input of Action View's `strip_tags` these entities will be unescaped what may cause a XSS attack if used in combination with `raw` or `html_safe`.  For example:      strip_tags("&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;")  Would generate:      <script>alert('XSS')</script>  After the fix it will generate:      &lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/strip_tags_fix.rb class ActionView::Base   def strip_tags(html)     self.class.full_sanitizer.sanitize(html)   end end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * Do-not-unescape-already-escaped-HTML-entities.patch  Credits ------- Thank you to Arthur Neves from GitHub and Spyros Livathinos from Zendesk for reporting the problem and working with us to fix it. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-23 23:00:27 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-25 15:00:41 UTC  ``` CRD: 2016-01-25 ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-26 07:25:56 UTC  ``` public at <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/205> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c4)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-27 10:25:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 663375](attachment.cgi?id=663375 "test/reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=663375&action=edit "test/reproducer") test/reproducer ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c5)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-27 10:34:38 UTC  ``` regarding openSUSE, this package is in Leap ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c6)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-27 12:56:55 UTC  ``` Jürgen, I saw your submission <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356270>  Could you check if fix for [bug 963327](show_bug.cgi?id=963327 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2015-7579: rubygem-rails-html-sanitizer: XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer") and [bug 963328](show_bug.cgi?id=963328 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2015-7580: rubygem-rails-html-sanitizer: XSS via whitelist sanitizer") are missing? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c7)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 14:00:10 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963327) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356287> 42.1 / rubygem-rails-html-sanitizer ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c9)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-28 09:29:05 UTC  ``` all submissions done.

Subject: [CVE-2016-0752] Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in Action
 View

Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in Action View

There is a possible directory traversal and information leak vulnerability in
Action View. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2016-0752.

Versions Affected:  All.
Not affected:       None.
Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1

Impact
------
Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a
controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.

Impacted code will look something like this:

```ruby
def index
  render params[:id]
end
```

Carefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from
unexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and can
possibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
A workaround to this issue is to not pass arbitrary user input to the `render`
method.  Instead, verify that data before passing it to the `render` method.

For example, change this:

```ruby
def index
  render params[:id]
end
```

To this:

```ruby
def index
  render verify_template(params[:id])
end

private
def verify_template(name)
  # add verification logic particular to your application here
end
```

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 3-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series
* 4-1-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.1 series
* 4-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series
* 5-0-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0 series

Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users
of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we
cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported
releases.

Credits
-------
Thanks John Poulin for reporting this!

## Synopsis

Important: rh-ror41 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0296)

## Topic

Updated rh-ror41-rubygem-actionpack, rh-ror41-rubygem-actionview,
rh-ror41-rubygem-activemodel, and rh-ror41-rubygem-activerecord packages
that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat Software
Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rh-ror41 collection provides Ruby on Rails version 4.1. Ruby on Rails
is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.

The following issue was corrected in rubygem-actionpack and
rubygem-actionview:

A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Action View component
searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted
input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use
this to render unexpected files and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-0752)

The following issues were corrected in rubygem-actionpack:

A flaw was found in the way the Action Pack component performed MIME type
lookups. Since queries were cached in a global cache of MIME types, an
attacker could use this flaw to grow the cache indefinitely, potentially
resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0751)

A flaw was found in the Action Pack component's caching of controller
references. An attacker could use this flaw to cause unbounded memory
growth, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7581)

A flaw was found in the way the Action Controller component compared user
names and passwords when performing HTTP basic authentication. Time taken
to compare strings could differ depending on input, possibly allowing a
remote attacker to determine valid user names and passwords using a timing
attack. (CVE-2015-7576)

The following issue was corrected in rubygem-activerecord:

A flaw was found in the Active Record component's handling of nested
attributes in combination with the destroy flag. An attacker could possibly
use this flaw to set attributes to invalid values or clear all attributes.
(CVE-2015-7577)

The following issue was corrected in rubygem-activemodel and
rubygem-activerecord:

A flaw was found in the way the Active Model based models processed
attributes. An attacker with the ability to pass arbitrary attributes to
models could possibly use this flaw to bypass input validation.
(CVE-2016-0753)

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges John Poulin as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-0752, Aaron Patterson of Red Hat as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-0751, Daniel Waterworth as the original reporter of CVE-2015-7576,
Justin Coyne as the original reporter of CVE-2015-7577, and John Backus
from BlockScore as the original reporter of CVE-2016-0753.

All rh-ror41 collection rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-actionview,
rubygem-activemodel, and rubygem-activerecord packages users are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to
correct these issues. All running applications using the rh-ror41
collection must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963330#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:26:02 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Nested attributes rejection proc bypass in Active Record.  There is a vulnerability in how the nested attributes feature in Active Record handles updates in combination with destroy flags when destroying records is disabled. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7577.  Versions Affected:  3.1.0 and newer Not affected:       3.0.x and older Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due to a change in the commit [a9b4b5d][1] the `_destroy` flag prevents the `:reject_if` proc from being called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway.  However this isn't true if `:allow_destroy` is false so this leads to changes that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could use this do things like set attributes to invalid values and to clear all of the attributes amongst other things. The severity will be dependent on how the application has used this feature.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/nested_attributes_bypass_fix.rb module ActiveRecord   module NestedAttributes     private      def reject_new_record?(association_name, attributes)       will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes) || call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)     end      def call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)       return false if will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)        case callback = self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:reject_if]       when Symbol         method(callback).arity == 0 ? send(callback) : send(callback, attributes)       when Proc         callback.call(attributes)       end     end      def will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)       allow_destroy?(association_name) && has_destroy_flag?(attributes)     end      def allow_destroy?(association_name)       self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:allow_destroy]     end   end end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 3.2 series * 4-1-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits ------- Thank you to Justin Coyne for reporting the problem and working with us to fix it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1301973#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-26 13:15:15 UTC  ``` A possible input validation circumvention vulnerability in Active Model was reported. Code that uses Active Model based models (including Active Record models) and does not validate user input before passing it to the model can be subject to an attack where specially crafted input will cause the model to skip validations.  External References:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyonrails-security/6jQVC1geukQ/8oYETcxbFQAJ> <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2016/1/25/Rails-5-0-0-beta1-1-4-2-5-1-4-1-14-1-3-2-22-1-and-rails-html-sanitizer-1-0-3-have-been-released/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1301973#c4)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-26 13:17:53 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-activerecord tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1301979](show_bug.cgi?id=1301979 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-0753 rubygem-activerecord: rubygem-activemodel: Possible Input Validation Circumvention in Active Model [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1301973#c5)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-26 13:18:12 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-activemodel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1301977](show_bug.cgi?id=1301977 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-0753 rubygem-activemodel: Possible Input Validation Circumvention in Active Model [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1301973#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2016-02-05 15:01:54 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  4.1 <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/50d3d7d01123fa9e08fcce5985fd6e8c24ba57ab> 4.2 <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e3ceb28e66ca6e869f8f9778dc42672f48001a90>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1301973#c8)  Ján Rusnačko    2016-02-10 12:23:03 UTC  ``` Analysis:  Several class attributes, including validation related, of Active Model models were writable from instances. Attacker with ability to pass arbitrary attributes to Active Model instances could use this to bypass validation. Impacted code:  ```ruby SomeModel.new(unverified_user_input) ```  Mitigation:  Do not allow arbitrary attributes to be passed to models. In Rails with Strong Parameters, make sure to not call permit! method, which bypasses strong parameters protections. Outside of rails, use whitelisting to filter only allowed attributes before passing them to models.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1301973#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-02-24 10:37:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:0296 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0296.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1301973#c12)  Fedora Update System    2016-02-28 08:23:53 UTC  ``` rubygem-activerecord-4.2.0-2.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.

    super(update_info(info,
      'Name'           => 'Ruby on Rails Dynamic Render File Upload Remote Code Execution',
      'Description'    => %q{
        This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the explicit render
        method when leveraging user parameters.
        This module has been tested across multiple versions of Ruby on Rails.
        The technique used by this module requires the specified
        endpoint to be using dynamic render paths, such as the following example:

        def show
          render params[:id]
        end

        Also, the vulnerable target will need a POST endpoint for the TempFile upload, this
        can literally be any endpoint. This module doesnt use the log inclusion method of
        exploitation due to it not being universal enough. Instead, a new code injection
        technique was found and used whereby an attacker can upload temporary image files
        against any POST endpoint and use them for the inclusion attack. Finally, you only
        get one shot at this if you are testing with the builtin rails server, use caution.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-7575.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-7577.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-7576 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7576)

#### Description

The http\_basic\_authenticate\_with method in actionpack/lib/action\_controller/metal/http\_authentication.rb in the Basic Authentication implementation in Action Controller in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not use a constant-time algorithm for verifying credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by measuring timing differences.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-26 12:55:44 UTC  ``` A possible directory traversal and information leak vulnerability in Action View was reported. Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.  Vulnerable code:  ```ruby def index   render params[:id] end ```  Carefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from unexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and can possibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack. All versions are affected.  <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2016/1/25/Rails-5-0-0-beta1-1-4-2-5-1-4-1-14-1-3-2-22-1-and-rails-html-sanitizer-1-0-3-have-been-released/>  External References:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyonrails-security/335P1DcLG00/OfB9_LhbFQAJ> <https://nvisium.com/blog/2016/01/26/rails-dynamic-render-to-rce-cve-2016-0752/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-26 12:56:12 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-actionview tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1301964](show_bug.cgi?id=1301964 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-0752 rubygem-actionview: Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in Action View [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c3)  Ján Rusnačko    2016-01-29 15:02:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1119445](attachment.cgi?id=1119445&action=diff "3.2 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1119445&action=edit "3.2 patch") 3.2 patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c4)  Ján Rusnačko    2016-01-29 15:02:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1119446](attachment.cgi?id=1119446&action=diff "4.1 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1119446&action=edit "4.1 patch") 4.1 patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c5)  Ján Rusnačko    2016-01-29 15:03:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1119447](attachment.cgi?id=1119447&action=diff "4.2 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1119447&action=edit "4.2 patch") 4.2 patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c6)  Ján Rusnačko    2016-01-29 15:04:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1119449](attachment.cgi?id=1119449&action=diff "5.0 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1119449&action=edit "5.0 patch") 5.0 patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2016-02-05 14:14:46 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  3.2 <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/18269d250fa58001ce7d8318571546aa90412975> 4.1 <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/be543e8e18246d5c2faa336eb3c0a03b797f3517> 4.2 <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/0c5c32aa7cea5ee1ea60bd1f87dfa5c7e7146a54>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-02-24 10:37:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:0296 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0296.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1301963#c15)  Fedora Update System    2016-02-28 08:27:55 UTC  ``` rubygem-actionview-4.2.0-3.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:18:38 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Timing attack vulnerability in basic authentication in Action Controller.  There is a timing attack vulnerability in the basic authentication support in Action Controller. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7576.  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ Due to the way that Action Controller compares user names and passwords in basic authentication authorization code, it is possible for an attacker to analyze the time taken by a response and intuit the password.  For example, this string comparison:    "foo" == "bar"  is possibly faster than this comparison:    "foo" == "fo1"  Attackers can use this information to attempt to guess the username and password used in the basic authentication system.  You can tell you application is vulnerable to this attack by looking for `http_basic_authenticate_with` method calls in your application.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/basic_auth_fix.rb module ActiveSupport   module SecurityUtils     def secure_compare(a, b)       return false unless a.bytesize == b.bytesize        l = a.unpack "C#{a.bytesize}"        res = 0       b.each_byte { |byte| res |= byte ^ l.shift }       res == 0     end     module_function :secure_compare      def variable_size_secure_compare(a, b)       secure_compare(::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(a), ::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(b))     end     module_function :variable_size_secure_compare   end end  module ActionController   class Base     def self.http_basic_authenticate_with(options = {})       before_action(options.except(:name, :password, :realm)) do         authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic(options[:realm] || "Application") do |name, password|           # This comparison uses & so that it doesn't short circuit and           # uses `variable_size_secure_compare` so that length information           # isn't leaked.           ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(name, options[:name]) &             ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(password, options[:password])         end       end     end   end end ```   Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 4-1-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits -------  Thank you to Daniel Waterworth for reporting the problem and working with us to fix it. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:19:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662977](attachment.cgi?id=662977&action=diff "5-0-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662977&action=edit "5-0-basic_auth.patch") 5-0-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:19:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662978](attachment.cgi?id=662978&action=diff "4-2-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662978&action=edit "4-2-basic_auth.patch") 4-2-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:20:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662979](attachment.cgi?id=662979&action=diff "4-1-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662979&action=edit "4-1-basic_auth.patch") 4-1-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:20:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662980](attachment.cgi?id=662980&action=diff "3-2-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662980&action=edit "3-2-basic_auth.patch") 3-2-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-23 23:00:50 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c10)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-26 07:21:30 UTC  ``` public at <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/201> ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c13)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-26 12:56:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 663243](attachment.cgi?id=663243 "an example rails application with authentication") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=663243&action=edit "an example rails application with authentication") an example rails application with authentication  I don't know how to test this fix.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:42:25 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in Action View  There is a possible directory traversal and information leak vulnerability in Action View. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2016-0752.  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.  Impacted code will look something like this:  ```ruby def index   render params[:id] end ```  Carefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from unexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and can possibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- A workaround to this issue is to not pass arbitrary user input to the `render` method.  Instead, verify that data before passing it to the `render` method.  For example, change this:  ```ruby def index   render params[:id] end ```  To this:  ```ruby def index   render verify_template(params[:id]) end  private def verify_template(name)   # add verification logic particular to your application here end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series * 4-1-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits ------- Thanks John Poulin for reporting this! ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:43:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662989](attachment.cgi?id=662989&action=diff "5-0-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662989&action=edit "5-0-render_data_leak.patch") 5-0-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:43:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662990](attachment.cgi?id=662990&action=diff "4-2-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662990&action=edit "4-2-render_data_leak.patch") 4-2-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:43:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662991](attachment.cgi?id=662991&action=diff "4-1-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662991&action=edit "4-1-render_data_leak.patch") 4-1-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:44:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662992](attachment.cgi?id=662992&action=diff "3-2-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662992&action=edit "3-2-render_data_leak.patch") 3-2-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-23 23:01:18 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-26 07:26:42 UTC  ``` public at <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/206> ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c9)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-26 16:31:08 UTC  ``` Portus and studio issues:  963607 963608 ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c13)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-27 09:58:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 663371](attachment.cgi?id=663371&action=diff "updated patch for 3.2 version") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=663371&action=edit "updated patch for 3.2 version") updated patch for 3.2 version  adapt the patch for 3.2 version to ruby 1.8 syntax.  <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/7f71b4d8a4744e26fcec7be13efb243e73ffd3ce>  Also I had to update the line numbers in the patch. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c15)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 16:00:29 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963332) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356307> 42.1 / rubygem-actionpack-4_2 ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c16)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 17:00:37 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963332) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356315> 13.2 / rubygem-actionpack-3_2 ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c17)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 18:00:32 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963332) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356334> 42.1 / rubygem-actionview-4_2 ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c18)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-28 09:06:44 UTC  ``` All submissions done.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963331#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:35:50 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Possible Object Leak and Denial of Service attack in Action Pack  There is a possible object leak which can lead to a denial of service vulnerability in Action Pack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2016-0751.  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ A carefully crafted accept header can cause a global cache of mime types to grow indefinitely which can lead to a possible denial of service attack in Action Pack.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- This attack can be mitigated by a proxy that only allows known mime types in the Accept header.  Placing the following code in an initializer will also mitigate the issue:  ```ruby require 'action_dispatch/http/mime_type'  Mime.const_set :LOOKUP, Hash.new { |h,k|   Mime::Type.new(k) unless k.blank? } ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 5-0-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0 series * 4-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 4-1-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 3-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.
