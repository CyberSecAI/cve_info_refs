Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-0021:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Memory corruption occurs when Microsoft Office fails to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability allows for remote code execution. Specifically, there is a failure to properly handle objects in memory when processing a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- Users with fewer privileges are less impacted but are still vulnerable to code execution within their user context.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- This could be achieved through email attachments or by hosting a malicious file on a website.
- The attacker must convince the user to open the file, as there is no method to force a user to do so.
- The preview pane is explicitly stated to *not* be an attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to craft a malicious Microsoft Office file.
- For an email attack, the attacker must be able to send the file to a target and convince them to open it.
- For a web-based attack, the attacker needs to host or compromise a website to host the malicious file and convince the target to click a link.
- No special access to the target system is required, other than the ability to deliver the malicious file to the target.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.
- The bulletin summary and MS16-029 article provides the affected software list, which includes Office 2007, 2010, 2013, 2013 RT, and 2016, and corresponding Microsoft server and web app versions.
- The exploitability assessment provided rates this vulnerability as "1 - Exploitation More Likely" on "Older Software Releases" of Microsoft Office.
- This specific CVE is listed under the MS16-029 bulletin, which is also covered in the provided document.
