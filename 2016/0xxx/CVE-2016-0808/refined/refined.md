Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-0808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the Minikin library when parsing fonts, specifically TrueType Fonts (TTF). A malformed TTF file can cause size calculations to overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow during size calculation while parsing a TTF font. This can be triggered by a specially crafted font file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The integer overflow can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The affected component crashes, which can result in a continuous reboot loop, effectively blocking access to the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves loading an untrusted, maliciously crafted font file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause an untrusted font to be loaded, leading to the overflow in the Minikin component.
