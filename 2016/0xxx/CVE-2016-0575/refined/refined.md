**CVE-2016-0575:**

*   **Component:** Oracle Learning Management
*   **Protocol:** HTTP
*   **Sub-component:** OTA Self Service
*   **Remote Exploit without Auth.:** No
*  **CVSS v2 Risk:**
    *   **Base Score:** 4.3
    *   **Access Vector:** Network
    *   **Access Complexity:** Medium
    *   **Authentication:** None
    *   **Confidentiality:** None

    *  **Availability:** Partial
*   **Vulnerability:** The document indicates a vulnerability exists within the "OTA Self Service" subcomponent of Oracle Learning Management. The document does not explicitly state the root cause, but based on the CVSS score, it appears to be related to a lack of sufficient validation or sanitization of user-controlled inputs.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to a partial loss of availability. This suggests a denial of service or reduced service functionality could occur.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker would need network access to the vulnerable component and would likely need to send crafted HTTP requests to the affected area, targeting the "OTA Self Service" functionality
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker requires network access to the application. The attack has medium complexity but does not require authentication. An attacker does not necessarily need valid credentials for the application.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-0575 involves a vulnerability in the Oracle Learning Management component that could allow a remote unauthenticated user to cause a partial loss of service availability by sending specially crafted requests.
