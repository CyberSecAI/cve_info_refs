{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the ability of an authenticated user to remove the last location of an image, which transitions the image status back to 'queued'. This allows the user to upload new image data, breaking the immutability promise of Glance.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks when deleting image locations, particularly the last location. The system incorrectly allows a non-admin user to modify the image status and data by deleting the last location which transitions the image status to 'queued' and enables the upload of new image data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious tenant can exploit this flaw to silently replace image data they own, regardless of the original creator or visibility settings. This undermines the immutability of images, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications and data corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves using the Glance API to delete the last location of an image. This can be achieved using the `glance location-delete` command or equivalent API calls.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (non-admin) with the ability to manage images they own. The attacker must also be in an environment where the `show_multiple_locations` configuration parameter is enabled (which is not the default configuration)."
