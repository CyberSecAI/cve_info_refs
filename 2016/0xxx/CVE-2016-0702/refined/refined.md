{
  "CVE-2016-0702": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Side-channel attack using cache-bank conflicts on Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Side-channel attack allowing for potential RSA key recovery through cache analysis.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potential recovery of RSA private keys. This issue is limited to the same hyperthreaded core where a malicious actor has code execution on a thread performing decryptions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attack, requires code execution on the same hyper-threaded Intel Sandy Bridge processor as the victim thread.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires the attacker to execute code on the same hyper-threaded core of the CPU as the targeted process that is performing decryption operations."
