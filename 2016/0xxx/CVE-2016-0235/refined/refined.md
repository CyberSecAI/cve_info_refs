- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Guardium Database Activity Monitor uses a hard-coded password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The hard-coded password, available to administrators or users with root access, could be used across other GRUB systems. This implies potential unauthorized access or control over affected systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an administrator or a user with root access to the affected system.
