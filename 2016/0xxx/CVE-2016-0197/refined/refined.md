Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-0197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of objects in memory within the Microsoft DirectX Graphics Kernel Subsystem (dxgkrnl.sys)
- Incorrect mapping of kernel memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Elevation of Privilege vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is due to the way the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem handles certain calls and escapes, leading to improper memory mapping and unintended elevation from user-mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run processes with elevated privileges.
- An attacker could take control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack scenario.
- The attacker must be logged on to the target system.
- The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to log on to the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted application on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (dxgkrnl.sys) handles certain calls and escapes, preventing improper memory mapping and unintended elevation from user-mode.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds were identified by Microsoft.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
