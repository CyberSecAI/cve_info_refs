Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver (Win32k). Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by an out-of-bounds memory read in the `NtGdiGetTextExtentExW` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Memory corruption due to improper object handling.
-  Out-of-bounds memory read in `NtGdiGetTextExtentExW`.
-  Elevation of privilege vulnerability due to the possibility of arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Elevation of privileges, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- Installation of programs.
- Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
- Creation of new accounts with full user rights.
- System compromise.
- Denial of Service

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must first log on to the system.
- An attacker must then run a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system with the ability to execute code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `win32k.sys` driver, affecting a wide range of Windows operating systems, including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and their respective server counterparts.
- The vulnerability is not publicly disclosed and was not known to be exploited at the time of the security bulletin release.
- The provided exploit from exploit-db is a proof of concept for a denial of service and is related to the out-of-bounds read in `NtGdiGetTextExtentExW`.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
