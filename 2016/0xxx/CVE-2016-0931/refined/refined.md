Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0931:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in how Adobe Acrobat Reader DC handles FileAttachment annotations. Specifically, the "point" attribute within these annotations can be manipulated to trigger a dangling pointer that is reused after being freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: The core issue is the premature freeing of a memory location which is then accessed again leading to unexpected behavior
- Dangling pointer: The manipulated "point" attribute leads to a dangling pointer, making the second access vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running the vulnerable Adobe Reader). This could enable the attacker to gain control of the user's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via a malicious page: The user would have to be lured to a malicious webpage.
- Remote attack via a malicious file: The user needs to open a specially crafted malicious file in Adobe Reader.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file or a link to a malicious website to the victim.
- User interaction is required, the target user needs to open the crafted PDF file or visit the malicious webpage.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat and Reader DC on both Windows and Macintosh.
- Adobe has released security updates to address this issue.
- This vulnerability was reported by Brian Gorenc of HP's Zero Day Initiative.
