- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM TRIRIGA builder tools are vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user without proper access can gain the ability to modify TRIRIGA applications.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly stated, but it involves the use of the TRIRIGA builder tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the TRIRIGA Application Platform and the ability to use its builder tools. The specific access required is not specified, but they would not normally have the ability to modify TRIRIGA applications.
