  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Windows while validating reparse points being set by sandbox applications. The fix for CVE-2015-2553 can be bypassed to get limited mount reparse points working again for sandbox attacks by abusing shadow object directories.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of reparse points",
      "Bypass of sandbox restrictions through manipulation of object directories"
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege. An attacker could run arbitrary code in the security context of the local system, allowing them to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local execution of a specially crafted application",
      "Abuse of shadow object directories",
      "Manipulating mount reparse points"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to log on to the system and execute a specially crafted application. They need to be able to create a named object directory (outside of a Chrome renderer). The exploit requires low integrity access.",
    "description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the fix for CVE-2015-2553 by using shadow object directories. NtCreateObjectDirectoryEx takes an additional parameter of a handle to a shadow directory, similar to the ?? -> GLOBAL?? fallback. By creating a named object directory, an attacker can shadow GLOBAL??, construct a DOS device path, and redirect reparse points to an arbitrary location. Releasing the inner object directory/symlink causes the higher-privileged application to pick up the real target. This gives a limited mount reparse point creation."
