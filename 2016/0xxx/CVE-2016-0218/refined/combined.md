 **CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2183](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183) **DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
