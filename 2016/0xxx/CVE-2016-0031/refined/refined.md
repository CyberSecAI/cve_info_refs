Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-0031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Exchange Server's Outlook Web Access (OWA) failing to properly handle web requests and sanitize user input and email content. This improper handling allows for script or content injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** OWA does not adequately validate web requests, allowing for the injection of malicious content.
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** OWA fails to properly sanitize user input and email content, which can lead to the execution of malicious scripts or the display of spoofed content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing:** An attacker can perform spoofing attacks by injecting malicious scripts or content, potentially tricking users into disclosing sensitive information.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Websites:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, which can be used for further attacks or to spoof content.
*   **Pivot Point:** Exploited vulnerabilities could be used as a pivot point to chain attacks with other web service vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted email containing a malicious link.
*   **Chat Client:** An attacker could use a chat client to socially engineer a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated Microsoft Exchange user.
*   **Ability to Send Email Messages:** The attacker needs the ability to send email messages to deliver the malicious link.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must click on the malicious link for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document states that no workarounds have been identified.
*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 and 2016.
*   The security update corrects how OWA validates web requests.
