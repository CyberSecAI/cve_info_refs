Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge improperly handle objects in memory, specifically during the layout of HTML tables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. By manipulating document elements, an attacker can force an array of `Layout::STableCellLayout::SNeighborPosition` objects to be reused after being freed. This results in memory corruption.
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper memory access leads to corruption, enabling arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user.
- **System Control:** If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the malicious webpage or open a malicious file for the exploit to occur.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **User Enticement:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious page, opening a malicious file, or interacting with malicious content on a compromised website, typically through social engineering tactics like emails or instant messages.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects both Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.
- The vulnerability is classified as 'Critical' for Windows client systems and 'Moderate' for server systems.
- A patch was released by Microsoft to address this vulnerability, by modifying how Internet Explorer/Edge handle objects in memory.
