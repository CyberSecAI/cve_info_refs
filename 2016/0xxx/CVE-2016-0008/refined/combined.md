## Vulnerability Information

## Windows GDI32.dll ASLR Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0008

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows graphics device interface handles objects in memory, allowing an attacker to retrieve information that could lead to an Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass.

To exploit this vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince users to view the website. This could also include compromised websites or websites that accept or host user-provided content or banner advertisements; such websites could contain specially crafted content that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to do so, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or Instant Messenger request.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending Outlook users a specially crafted email, or sending them a specially crafted Office document as an attachment, and convincing the user to read the message or open the file.

An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by hosting a malicious file on a network share and convincing users to navigate to the folder in Windows Explorer. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows graphics device interface handles memory addresses, thereby helping to protect the integrity of the ASLR security feature.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.

### Mitigating Factors

## Win32k Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0009

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a target system.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to convince a user to visit a malicious website that could exploit the vulnerability and run arbitrary code with the logged on userâs privileges. The security update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles objects in memory.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2016-0009](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0009). At the time this security bulletin was originally issued, Microsoft was unaware of any attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
