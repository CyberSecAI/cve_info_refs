Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the way the Windows graphics device interface (GDI32.dll) handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) Bypass:** The core weakness is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve information that can lead to bypassing the ASLR security feature. ASLR is a memory protection mechanism that randomizes the memory addresses of key system components, making it more difficult for attackers to predict where to place malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain information about memory layout. This information can then be used in further attacks to bypass security measures, such as ASLR, and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer. They would then need to convince users to visit the site, typically by tricking them into clicking a link in an email or instant message.
- **Email Attack:** An attacker could send a specially crafted email (or email with a malicious attachment like an Office document) to an Outlook user, convincing the user to open the email or file.
- **Network Share Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious file on a network share and convince users to navigate to the folder in Windows Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to use social engineering to convince users to visit malicious websites, open malicious emails, or navigate to network shares containing malicious files.
- **Ability to Host Content:** Attackers must be able to host malicious content on a website or network share, or send emails with malicious content.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is rated as **Important** (not critical).
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Windows operating system, including Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows 10 Version 1511.
- The security update (3124584) addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows graphics device interface handles memory addresses, thus protecting the integrity of the ASLR security feature.
