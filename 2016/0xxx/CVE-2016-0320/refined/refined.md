- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple REST endpoints in IBM UrbanCode Deploy do not properly authorize users attempting to modify UCD objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient authorization checks on REST endpoints allow authenticated users to modify objects without proper permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized modification of UCD objects, potentially affecting the behavior of legitimately triggered processes.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through network access to vulnerable REST endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
