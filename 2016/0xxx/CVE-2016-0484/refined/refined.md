Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw within the `DownloadServlet` servlet of Oracle Application Testing Suite.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The `scriptPath` parameter in the `DownloadServlet` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can exfiltrate arbitrary files from the vulnerable system by manipulating the `scriptPath` parameter and setting the `downloadType` to `otmPkg`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **HTTP:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests to the vulnerable servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by rgod, working with HP's Zero Day Initiative.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '21206'.
