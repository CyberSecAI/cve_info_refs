Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2016-0863: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The affected versions of the LightHouse SMS Software lack protection against CSRF attacks. The web server application does not use CSRF tokens.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Absence of CSRF tokens allows malicious actors to execute commands on an authenticated user's active connection without their knowledge.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can perform unwanted actions on the application, including creating new users or changing passwords.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by tricking an authenticated user to load a malicious URL/page, leading to unauthorized actions within the userâ€™s session.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to interact with a malicious link. No special privileges are required on the application itself, only that a user has an active session.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Identified in the Document:**
The document also describes three other vulnerabilities associated with other CVEs in the same product:

**CVE-2016-0864: Information Disclosure**
*   **Root Cause**: Lack of authentication for certain resources
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software discloses sensitive information like reports and usernames to unauthenticated users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote access to the vulnerable application.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**CVE-2016-0865: Insecure Credentials**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient protection of user credentials
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A user with limited privileges can change another user's password.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Privilege escalation, enabling unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Requires an authenticated low-privileged user to initiate the attack
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires a valid account with limited privileges.

**CVE-2016-0866: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software is susceptible to XSS, allowing manipulation of dynamic URLs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Redirection to malicious sites, session hijacking, network reconnaissance, and malware deployment.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Manipulation of dynamic URLs of the web application. Requires user interaction to trigger.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires tricking user to access malicious link.

**Mitigation Summary:**

*   Tollgrade Communications, Inc. released an update to address these vulnerabilities.
*   Users are advised to isolate control system devices, place them behind firewalls, and use secure remote access methods like VPNs.
*   Users should be trained to recognize social engineering threats and avoid clicking suspicious links.
