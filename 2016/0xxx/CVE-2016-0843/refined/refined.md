  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm Performance Module component for ARM processors. This allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the kernel.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of privilege vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local malicious application can execute arbitrary code within the kernel, leading to a local permanent device compromise. The device would likely need to be repaired by re-flashing the operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local malicious application",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device."
