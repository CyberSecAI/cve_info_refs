# Security Bulletin: Multiple Security Vulnerabilities fixed in IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There are multiple security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager Product

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0366](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0366) IBM Security Identity Manager Virtual Appliance could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information due to weak encryption using man in the middle techniques.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112071> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-8629](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8629) **DESCRIPTION:** MIT Kerberos could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a null termination in the xdr\_nullstring() function. By sending specially-crafted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the memory.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110395> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0787](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0787) **DESCRIPTION:** libssh2 could provide weaker than expected security, caused by a type confusion error during the SSHv2 handshake resulting in the generation of a reduced amount of random bits for Diffie-Hellman. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the truncated Diffie-Hellman secret to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111562> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0799](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0799) **DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory error in the BIO\_\*printf() functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to trigger an out-of-bounds read.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2105](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2105) **DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 5.6

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2106](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2106) **DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 5.6

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112856> for the current score

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2107](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107) **DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt traffic.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2109](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2109) **DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory allocation error. By reading specially crafted ASN.1 data from a BIO using functions such as d2i\_CMS\_bio(), an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available resources and exhaust memory.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112857> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted string to cause an out-of-bounds write or consume an overly large amount of resources.

CVSS Base Score: 7.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111304> for the current score
