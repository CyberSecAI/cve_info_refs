Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Apache Tomcat handles session persistence mechanisms. Specifically, the `StandardManager`, `PersistentManager`, and `Cluster` implementations are affected. These mechanisms persist sessions using Tomcat's internal code and its permissions. A malicious web application could insert a crafted object into a session, and during persistence, the crafted object could trigger the execution of arbitrary code due to the permissions granted to Tomcat's internal code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Security Manager Bypass:** The vulnerability allows malicious code to execute with the privileges of Tomcat internal code, effectively bypassing the intended security manager restrictions.
*   **Unsafe Session Persistence:** The vulnerability highlights a lack of validation when deserializing session attributes during the persistence process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the Tomcat server, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control over the server or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: If an attacker compromises a web application, they can then escalate privileges to those of the Tomcat process when the specially crafted object is deserialized from the persistent session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious web application injects a crafted object into a user session.
*   When the session is persisted, the crafted object is stored using internal Tomcat code.
*   Upon deserialization of the session object, the crafted object is read, and if the attacker controlled the object, code can be executed with Tomcat privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to deploy a web application to a vulnerable Tomcat server. 
*   **Authentication:** An authenticated user of a web application is needed to insert a malicious object into the session.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Apache Tomcat versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.44, 7.0.0 to 7.0.67, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30, and 9.0.0.M1, as well as potentially earlier unsupported versions.
*   Multiple session persistence mechanisms are vulnerable, including StandardManager, PersistentManager, and the Cluster implementation, thus increasing the attack surface.
*  The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" by the Apache Tomcat team, but Red Hat rated it as "Important" implying that it is a high impact vulnerability.
*   Mitigation involves upgrading to specific versions (9.0.0.M3, 8.0.32, 7.0.68, 6.0.45 or later) to include the patches.
* The Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2 for RHEL 6 and 7 were identified as vulnerable.
* The affected SUSE Linux products included SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 and 12, and openSUSE leap 42.1
* The vulnerability is addressed in tomcat package version 7.0.69-10.el7 for SUSE Liberty Linux 7, and versions 6.0.45-0.50.1, 7.0.68-7.6.1, 8.0.32-3.1, 9.0.12-1.7, 9.0.21-3.13.2, and other version depending on the product and the fix.
