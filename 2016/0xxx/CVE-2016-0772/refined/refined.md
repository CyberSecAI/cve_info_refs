Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `smtplib` library in Python did not raise an exception when `STARTTLS` failed to be established. Specifically, if a server advertised STARTTLS but failed to respond with a '220' OK code after the client's `starttls()` request, the library wouldn't flag the failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper error handling
- Lack of validation of STARTTLS command execution

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform a "STARTTLS stripping attack," where they would intercept the initial connection and prevent the establishment of a TLS layer, effectively downgrading the connection to unencrypted traffic.
- This could potentially allow a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker to read sensitive information and modify communications between the client and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Man-in-the-middle attack between a python application and the SMTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the client (Python application) and the SMTP server.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to block/modify the SMTP communication.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is linked to other issues, particularly with glibc's getaddrinfo(), which ignores newlines in IP addresses, which, when combined with this vulnerability can lead to directing HTTP connections to a malicious server.
- The vulnerability affects Python libraries httplib, ftplib, and url libraries.
-  The identified vulnerable code is within Pythonâ€™s `smtplib` library, specifically within the `SMTP.starttls()` function.
-  Upstream patches were made available for different Python versions (2.7, 3.4 and 3.5).
- Red Hat errata was issued for affected versions of python.
- Suse also addressed this issue through security advisories.
