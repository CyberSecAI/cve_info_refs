Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `mediaserver` component of Android. Specifically, it's related to how `mediaserver` handles certain operations, potentially when processing data from untrusted sources. This flaw allows an attacker to execute code within the context of an elevated system application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is an elevation of privilege. A local malicious application can exploit the flaw to gain the ability to execute code in the context of a system application that has higher privileges. This is due to a logic error or missing security checks in how `mediaserver` processes certain data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation. An attacker-controlled application could gain permissions that third-party apps normally don't have, such as Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions. This can enable the attacker to access sensitive system resources, manipulate data, or perform actions that are normally restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable by local applications, meaning that a malicious app installed on the device could trigger the vulnerability.  It's unclear from the provided information what kind of specific interaction is needed for exploitation but it involves the processing of media data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the targeted device. No physical access to the device is needed, the attacker can be a malicious app installed on the device.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1.
- The fix involves changes in the Android frameworks, specifically in the `frameworks/av` component, as indicated by the AOSP links provided. The AOSP links point to specific commits that address the issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by the [C0RE Team](http://c0reteam.org) from [Qihoo 360](http://www.360safe.com) on Dec 17, 2015.
