- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in IBM Rational Quality Manager, allowing an authenticated attacker to inject commands through a specially crafted HTML request. These injected commands are then executed by the operating system with the privileges of the user running the application.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary operating system commands.
  - Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize input received through HTML requests.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to:
    - System compromise: The attacker could gain control of the affected system.
    - Data breach: The attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
    - Denial of service: The attacker could disrupt the normal functioning of the application.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTML request.
    - The attack is network-based (AV:N), requiring an attacker to be able to send requests to the vulnerable server.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be authenticated (PR:L) to access and submit the malicious HTML request.
    - The attacker does not require any user interaction to trigger the exploit (UI:N).
