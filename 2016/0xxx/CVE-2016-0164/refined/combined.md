## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3148531)

Published: April 12, 2016 | Updated: April 11, 2017

**Version:** 2.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory
* Correcting how Internet Explorer validates input before loading DLL files
* Helping to restrict what information is returned to Internet Explorer

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3148531](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3148531).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-generated content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0154](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0154) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0159](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0159) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0164](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0164) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0166](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0166) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## DLL Loading Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0160

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly validates input before loading dynamic link library (DLL) files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the target system and then run a specially crafted application. The updates address the vulnerability by correcting how Internet Explorer validates input before loading DLL files.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DLL Loading Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0160) | Yes | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0162

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly handle JavaScript. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to detect specific files on the user's computer. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability.

In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-generated content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed. Note that the vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate a userâs rights directly, but the vulnerability could be used to obtain information in an attempt to further compromise the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to restrict what information is returned to Internet Explorer.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0162](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0162) | No | Yes |
