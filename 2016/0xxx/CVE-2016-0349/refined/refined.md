Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0349:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks in the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) REST API when updating process instance variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The core issue is that the REST API for updating process instance variables lacked proper authorization checks. This allowed users without the necessary permissions to modify these variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Modification of Process Instance Variables:** Attackers could modify process instance variables without proper authorization. This could lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or manipulation of business processes.
- **Potential for Business Process Disruption:** By manipulating process variables, attackers could disrupt normal business operations and potentially cause financial or operational damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API Access:** The vulnerability is exploited through the IBM BPM REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of IBM Business Process Manager. This means the attacker must have an account on the system, but not necessarily admin privileges.
- **Network Access:** Attacker requires network access to the BPM server to use the vulnerable REST API.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Affected Products and Versions:** IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 and V8.5.6 through V8.5.6.0 cumulative fix 2 are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed by applying interim fix for APAR JR55701. This fix introduces an authorization check to verify that the user is an IBM BPM admin or a member of the IBM Process Portal admin team for the process application. It also allows defining action policies to authorize additional users, if no Portal Admin Team is defined.
- **CVSS:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3, indicating a moderate severity.
