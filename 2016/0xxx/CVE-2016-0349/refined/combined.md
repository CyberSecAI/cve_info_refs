# JR55701: SECURITY APAR - CVE-2016-0349 - INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION FOR UPDATE OF PROCESS INSTANCE VARIABLES IN IBM BPM

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  Because the action of updating process instance variables is not
  correctly authorized, users without required permission can
  update process instance variables in IBM Business Process
  Manager.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) provides a REST API to update
  process instance variables that applies insufficient
  authorization checks.

  PRODUCTS AFFECTED
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
  IBM BPM Standard
  IBM BPM Express

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6 and V8.5.7 that adds an
  authorization check for the REST API. This check verifies that
  the user is either an IBM BPM admin or member of the IBM Process
  Portal admin team that is defined for the process application
  containing the process instance. As long as no IBM Process
  Portal admin team is defined, you can authorize additional users
  by setting the ACTION_UPDATE_INSTANCE_VARIABLE action policy.

  If set to "false", the members defined for an action policy can
  perform the corresponding action, regardless of whether the
  Portal Admin Team is defined.

  For IBM BPM V8.5.6 Cumulative Fix 2, go to Fix Central
  (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral) and search for JR55701:

  1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
    the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
    level, and your platform, and then click Continue.

  2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR55701, and click Continue.

  When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
  the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
  additional installation instructions and information about the
  fix.

  For IBM BPM V8.5.7, a fix will be included in an upcoming IBM
  Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5 cumulative maintenance
  vehicle.

  To determine whether the cumulative fix is available and
  download it if it is, complete the following steps on Fix
  Central:

  1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
  the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
  level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
  2. Select Text, enter ?cumulative fix?, and click Continue.

  ```
