- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an issue in the bundled IBM Cognos Business Intelligence component within IBM OpenPages GRC Platform. If a user logs out but does not close the browser, a subsequent local user could potentially gain access to sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to properly clear session data upon logout, allowing for unauthorized information access by a local user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user could obtain sensitive information left behind by a previous user who did not close their browser after logging out.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user gaining access to a system after a previous user has logged out but left the browser open.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with access to the system after a previous user has logged out but not closed the browser.
