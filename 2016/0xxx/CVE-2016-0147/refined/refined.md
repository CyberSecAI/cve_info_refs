Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis for CVE-2016-0147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) parser processes user-provided input. Specifically, there's an issue in the way the MSXML parser handles XML content, which can lead to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation within the MSXML parser. This allows specially crafted XML content to be processed in a way that it leads to remote code execution.
- The vulnerability resides in the MSXML 3.0 component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on the target system.
- This could lead to an attacker gaining full control over the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a user clicking a specially crafted link. This could be delivered via:
  - Email messages
  - Instant Messenger messages
  - Visiting a malicious website with a crafted XML document.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to click the link; there is no way for the attacker to force the user to do so.
- The vulnerability can be triggered through Internet Explorer when it parses the malicious XML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host malicious XML content (e.g. on a web server).
- They need to convince a victim to access this content via a link using Internet Explorer.
- No specific local system access is required, only to convince a user to click on a malicious link.
- No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical."
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the MSXML parser processes user input.
- The provided information does not indicate the nature of the input processing error and any specifics about the root cause.

This vulnerability is part of the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-040.
