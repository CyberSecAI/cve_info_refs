Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-0937:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Acrobat Pro DC handles OCG (Optional Content Group) objects. A specially crafted PDF with a specific OCG action can trigger the reuse of a dangling pointer after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when memory that has been freed is accessed again, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means the attacker can potentially gain control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF document.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The vulnerability can also be exploited by having the target visit a malicious web page that triggers the exploit through a crafted PDF.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, either by opening a malicious PDF file or by visiting a malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without requiring direct access to the target's system.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious PDF:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted PDF file with a specific OCG action.
*   **Social Engineering (Likely):** Since user interaction is needed, the attacker would likely need to use social engineering techniques to trick the victim into opening the PDF or visiting a malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Adobe released a security update to fix the vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected by a specific Digital Vaccine filter.

**Summary**

CVE-2016-0937 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC related to the handling of OCG objects that allows for remote code execution when a user interacts with a malicious PDF file or webpage.
