- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the exposure of sensitive information in README files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leakage vulnerability. The product improperly restricts access to README files, allowing authenticated users to obtain information that could aid further attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can obtain sensitive information from README files, which can be leveraged to facilitate further attacks against the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An authenticated user can access README files containing sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system.
