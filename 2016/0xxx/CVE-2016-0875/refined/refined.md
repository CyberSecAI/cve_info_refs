Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-0875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access controls on the web server of the Moxa EDR-G903 secure router. Specifically, by accessing a specific URL, an unauthenticated user can gain access to sensitive configuration and log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The primary weakness is that an unauthenticated user can access restricted files, effectively escalating their privileges beyond what they should be able to do. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access configuration and log files. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as network configurations, user credentials, and potentially other security-related data.
* The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.5 with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed by sending a specific URL request to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Moxa EDR-G903 device.
*   **Low Skill:** The vulnerability is considered easily exploitable, requiring a low level of attacker skill. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the web server.
