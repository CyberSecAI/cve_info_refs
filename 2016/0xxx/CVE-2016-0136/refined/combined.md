## Security Update for Microsoft Office (3148775)

Published: April 12, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3148775](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3148775).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

The following severity ratings assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletin's release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the [April bulletin summary](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms16-apr).

## Update FAQ

**I have Microsoft Word 2010 installed. Why am I not being offered the 3114990 update?**

The 3114990 update only applies to systems running specific configurations of Microsoft Office 2010. Some configurations will not be offered the update.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335). For a list of Microsoft Office products an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. Note that where the severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector for [CVE-2016-0127](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0127). In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0122](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0122) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0127](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0127) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0136](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0136) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0139](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0139) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

**Workaround for CVE-2016-0127**

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent Office from opening RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources**

**Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

**For Office 2007**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

   ```
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

   ```
2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **1**.

   **Note** To use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2007, all of the latest Office 2007 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.

**For Office 2010**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

   ```
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

   ```
2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **2**.
3. Set the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value to **0**.

**For Office 2013**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

   ```
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

   ```
2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **2**.
3. Set the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value to **0**.

**Impact of Workaround**. Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922849](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922849) will be unable to open documents saved in the RTF format.

**How to undo the workaround**

**For Office 2007**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

   ```
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

   ```
2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.

**For Office 2010**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

   ```
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

   ```
2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.
3. Leave the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value set to **0**.

**For Office 2013**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

   ```
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]

   ```
2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.
3. Leave the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value set to **0**.

**Workaround for CVE-2016-0136**

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent Office from opening Office 2003 (Excel binary files) and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

**For Office 2007**

1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following sub key:

   ```
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

   ```
2. Set the **BinaryFiles** DWORD value to **1**.

   **Note** To use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2007, all of the latest Office 2007 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.

   **Impact of Workaround**. Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922849](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922849) will be unable to open documents saved in the Office 2003 or older file formats.

**How to undo the workaround**
