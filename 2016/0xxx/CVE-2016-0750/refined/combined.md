RHSA-2017:3244 - Security Advisory

发布：

# RHSA-2017:3244 - Security Advisory

* [概述](#overview)

## 概述

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.1 security update

## 类型/严重性

Security Advisory: Important

## 标题

Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.1 is now available for download from the Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on Infinispan.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that Apache Lucene would accept an object from an unauthenticated user that could be manipulated through subsequent post requests. An attacker could use this flaw to assemble an object that could permit execution of arbitrary code if the server enabled Apache Solr's Config API. (CVE-2017-12629)
* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* The hotrod java client in infinispan automatically deserializes bytearray message contents in certain events. A malicious user could exploit this flaw by injecting a specially-crafted serialized object to attain remote code execution or conduct other attacks. (CVE-2016-0750)

For more information regarding CVE-2017-12629, see the article linked in the references section.

Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Olsson (TrueSec) for reporting CVE-2016-0750.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1501529#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2017-10-12 19:11:42 UTC  ``` It was found that Apache Solr would accept an object from an unauthenticated user that could be manipulated through subsequent post requests. An attacker could use this flaw to assemble an object that could permit execution of arbitrary code on the server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1501529#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2017-10-12 19:20:01 UTC  ``` Satellite 6.2 and later do not ship lucene so are not vulnerable to this. Satellite 6.0 and 6.1 ship lucene v.4 which is not vulnerable to this issue. SAM 1.x ships an old version of lucene (v.3) that is not vulnerable to this issue, additionally the affected class does not appear to be used.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1501529#c4)  Chess Hazlett    2017-10-12 20:12:34 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Until fixes are available, all Solr users are advised to restart their Solr instances with the system parameter `-Ddisable.configEdit=true`. This will disallow any changes to be made to configurations via the Config API. This is a key factor in this vulnerability, since it allows GET requests to add the RunExecutableListener to the config.  This is sufficient to protect from this type of attack, but means you cannot use the edit capabilities of the Config API until further fixes are in place.   ```  [Comment

affected by this flaw, as they do not use the vulnerable functionality of either aspect of the issue. Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite Red Hat JBoss BRMS Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Red Hat Single Sign-On 7 Red Hat JBoss Portal Platform 6  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 is not affected by this flaw. However, it does ship the vulnerable Lucene class in a dependency to another component. Customers who reuse the lucene-queryparser jar in their applications may be vulnerable to the External Entity Expansion aspect of this flaw. This will be patched in a forthcoming release.  Red Hat JBoss Fuse is not affected by this flaw, as it does not use the vulnerable functionality of either aspect of this flaw. Fuse customers who may be running external Solr servers, while not affected from the Fuse side, are advised to secure their Solr servers as recommended in the mitigation provided.  The following products ship only the Lucene components relevant to this flaw, and are not vulnerable to the second portion of the vulnerability, the code execution exploit. As such, the impact of this flaw has been determined to be Moderate for these respective products: Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Red Hat Software Collections 2.4  This issue did not affect the versions of lucene as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does not affect Elasticsearch as shipped in OpenShift Container Platform.   ```  [Comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=1501529#c45)  Ted Jongseok Won    2020-11-10 04:20:17 UTC  ``` Downstream fixed version: <https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/org/apache/lucene/lucene-queryparser/5.3.1.redhat-2/>   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=1501529#c48)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-03-20 09:13:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Process Automation  Via RHSA-2023:1334 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1334](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1334)   ``` |  |

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.
