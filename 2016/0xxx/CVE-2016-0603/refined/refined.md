  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The installers for Oracle Java SE (versions 6/7/8) and VirtualBox load and execute DLLs from their application directory, which may be a user-controlled location like the Downloads folder.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DLL hijacking/planting",
      "Uncontrolled search path element"
    ],
    "impact": "If an attacker places a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL in the application directory, the installer will load and execute it, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the installer process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attack"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer before the installer is executed."
