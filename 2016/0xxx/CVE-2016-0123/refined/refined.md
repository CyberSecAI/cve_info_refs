Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Edge improperly processes HTML content with absolute positioning. Specifically, it relates to how the browser accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force Microsoft Edge to read memory outside the allocated bounds of an array.
- **Memory Corruption:** The improper handling of objects in memory leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed through Microsoft Edge.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that allow user-provided content.
- **Malicious Files:** An attacker can embed the exploit within a malicious file that, when opened by the user in Microsoft Edge, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the malicious content (visit a website or open a file) to trigger the vulnerability. This is typically achieved through social engineering, such as phishing emails or malicious links.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.
- Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on November 24, 2015, and the advisory was released on March 8, 2016.
