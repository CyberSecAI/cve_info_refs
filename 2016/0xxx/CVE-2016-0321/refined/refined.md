Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-0321

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A design flaw in IBM Personal Communications (PCOMM) where the Windows username and password are passed as plain text to the `pcsnp.exe` process during Windows logon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Password Transmission:** The primary vulnerability is the transmission of user credentials in plain text, making them easily readable and interceptable.
- **Exposed Credentials:** The `pcsnp.exe` process, during Windows login, receives the username and password in plaintext.
- **Capture Vulnerability:** This plaintext information can be captured by malicious applications running on the same system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who successfully captures the plain text username and password can gain unauthorized access to the user's account and potentially sensitive information.
- **Credential Theft:** Malicious software running on a compromised system can extract the credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malware on Compromised System:**  An attacker needs a foothold on the victim's system, often achieved by getting the victim to run malware (e.g., opening a malicious email attachment or visiting a malicious website).
- **Interception:** After the malware is executed and running, the vulnerability allows for the plain text password to be read, either through directly accessing the pcsnp.exe process or other capture methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Level:** The attacker's code runs with the same privileges as the user, but this code doesn't need to have access to the password, it just needs to be able to access the process parameters.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Personal Communications versions 6.0 to 6.0.16, version 12.0, and versions 13.0.0 - 13.0.1. The issue was resolved starting with version 13.0.2.
- The fix involves changing the design of `pcsnp.exe` to prevent passing the password in plain text.
- APAR IT12006 is associated with this vulnerability.
