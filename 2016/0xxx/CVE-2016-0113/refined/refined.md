**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in how Internet Explorer handles the user's browsing history, specifically related to the `CTravelEntry` object.
- By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can cause a `CTravelEntry` object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system.
- **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Malicious Files:**  User interaction is required in the form of visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through a network.
- **User Interaction:** The target user must be convinced to visit the malicious page or open the malicious file for the exploit to succeed.
