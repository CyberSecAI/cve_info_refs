Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0943:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Global object of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. It stems from the ability to bypass JavaScript API restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is an insufficient enforcement of JavaScript API restrictions. This allows specially crafted PDF documents with specific JavaScript instructions to circumvent the intended security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control over the affected machine, leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a specially crafted PDF file containing malicious JavaScript instructions. The victim must interact with the malicious content, either by visiting a malicious web page serving the PDF or by opening the PDF directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file and deliver it to the victim. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    * Hosting the PDF on a malicious website.
    * Sending the PDF as an email attachment.
    * Embedding the PDF in other documents or applications.
The attacker does not need any prior authentication. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
