## Analysis of CVE-2016-0092

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0092:

**Description:** Microsoft Windows OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) is vulnerable to remote code execution.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from Windows OLE failing to properly validate user input when handling specially crafted files or programs. Specifically, the `OleLoadPicture` function is affected. User-supplied data is used to calculate a buffer length for allocation, leading to a heap buffer overflow where the function writes beyond the allocated buffer boundary.

**Vulnerability:**
- Heap buffer overflow in `OleLoadPicture` function.
- Improper validation of user-supplied data when calculating buffer length.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file (e.g., specially crafted document) or run a malicious program obtained from a webpage or email. This requires user interaction.

**Required Capabilities:**
- Ability to craft malicious files or programs that trigger the vulnerability in OLE.
- Social engineering to convince a user to open/run the malicious file/program.

**Affected Software:**
- Windows Vista
- Windows Server 2008
- Windows 7
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows 8.1
- Windows RT 8.1
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows 10

**Mitigation:** Apply the security update described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-030 (KB3143136) to correct how Windows OLE validates user input.
