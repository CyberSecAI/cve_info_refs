## Installation

Installation instructions for HMC
Version 8 upgrades and corrective service can be found at
these locations:

[Upgrading
or restoring HMC Version 8](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020109)

[Installation
methods for HMC Version 8 fixes](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020134)

Instructions and images for upgrading via a remote network
install can be found here:

[HMC
V8 network installation images and installation instructions](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020108)

## Additional information

### Notes:

1. The Install Corrective Service task now allows you to
   install corrective service updates from the ISO image files
   of these updates. You can download these ISO image files for
   the HMC, and then use the ISO image file to install the
   corrective service update. You no longer need to burn CD-R
   or DVD-R media to use the ISO image file to install
   corrective service.
2. This image requires DVD -R media.
3. To install updates over the network, select the \*.iso file
   on the "Select Service Package" panel of the Install
   Corrective Service task. The HMC application extracts the
   files needed to install the corrective service. If you are
   using USB flash media, copy the \*.iso file to the flash
   media, and then select the file when prompted.
4. The **updhmc** command line command has also been
   modified to use the \*.iso file. To use the command, follow
   the syntax in this example:

   updhmc -t s -h <myservername> -f
   </home/updates/corrrective\_service.iso> -u
   <HMC\_username> -i

In all cases, the HMC application extracts the files needed
to install the corrective service.

## PTF MH01638

This package includes a fix for HMC Version 8 Release 8.3.0
Service Pack 2.  You can reference this package by APAR
MB04025 and PTF MH01638. This image must be installed on top of
HMC Version 8 Release 8.3.0 Service Pack 2 (PTF MH01540) with or
without additional fixes.

Note: This PTF supersedes PTF MH01625 and MH01631.

## Known Issues:

1**. Special Install Instructions**

Installing this PTF using the Enhanced+ interface may hang.
Prior to installing this PTF using the web browser graphical
interface perform the following:
> 1. Log in again selecting the Log In option of "Classic".
> 2. If already logged in to the HMC using Enhanced+ GUI, log
>    off the HMC.
> 3. Install using the normal installation instructions.

Alternatively, install this PTF using CLI.

2. After installing this PTF, the security mode cannot be changed.
The **chhmc -c security -s modify --mode nist\_sp800\_131a**
command will fail with "*Invalid Parameter*".

3. The  Console Window > Open Terminal Window task may
fail with "*javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: handshake alert:
unrecognized\_name*" in Java console output.   The
circumvention is to use ssh vtmenu/mkvterm command.  A fix is
planned for a future PTF.
## Command line changes

This PTF adds a new option to the chhmc command to allow an
admin to set a grub password at bootup.  To resolve this
security vulnerability, users apply the PTF (with mandatory
reboot) then set a password.

Syntax:

**chhmc -c grubpasswd**

**-s** {**enable** | **disable** | **modify**}

[**--passwd** password]

* To enable and set the password

  **chhmc -c grubpasswd -s enable --passwd** password
* To disable the grub password

  c**hhmc -c grubpasswd -s  disable**
* To modify the grub password

  **c****hmc -c grubpasswd -s  modify --passwd** password

## List of fixes

**Security Fixes**

* Added functionality to the chhmc command to allow an admin
  to set a grub password at bootup.
* Fixed openSSL vulnerabilities:  CVE-2016-2105,
  CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2108, and CVE-2016-2109
* Fixed security scan vulnerability by enabling TLSv1.2 by
  default for HMC vterm port (9960) when HMC is in Legacy mode.
* Fixed Java vulnerability: CVE-2016-3426
* Fixed Power Hardware Management Console: CVE-2016-0230

**General** **Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where backing up the HMC included PCM data
  even though the user did not select to include PCM data.
* Fixed an issue where a newly added usb device did not get an
  entry in the /etc/fstab table impacting lshw calls.
* Implemented associations between CEC and Lpars during
  heartbeat reporting for the Entity ID (e.g., EPS/RCHR00000001)
  of Lpar and id if CEC have a relationship of "containedIn" in
  the associations table.
* Included Entity ID in the email notifications sent to the
  customer after call home transactions.
* Fixed an issue where the call home from the Manage Dumps
  panel was uploading incomplete data.
* Fixed an issue with chhmc where adding a name server failed
  silently.

**Previously released fixes also included in this PTF:**

| **MH01631** 05/15/16 | * Fixed a Repair & Verify issue on systems   utilizing the 24 inch frame with a power subsystem   where users can experience a failure of concurrent   service maintenance activities on power components   within the CEC enclosure, the Power Subsystem   enclosure, and any installed I/O devices within the   frame.        Servers impacted include the  POWER 575, 590,   595, 795:  models 9125-F2A,F2B,F2C; 9118-575;   9119-590,595,FHA,FHB; 9406-595.

The IO   Drawer must be powered off and partitions may need   to be shut down to continue the repair.* " * Fixed an issue where call home was attempting to   establish a connection to the old (pre HMC V8R8.3)   callhome servers even when not using legacy callhome.   If the legacy callhome addresses were blocked by a   firewall, call home may fail. |

## Additional information

### Notes:

1. The Install Corrective Service task now allows you to
   install corrective service updates from the ISO image files
   of these updates. You can download these ISO image files for
   the HMC, and then use the ISO image file to install the
   corrective service update. You no longer need to burn CD-R
   or DVD-R media to use the ISO image file to install
   corrective service.
2. This image requires DVD -R media.
3. To install updates over the network, select the \*.iso file
   on the "Select Service Package" panel of the Install
   Corrective Service task. The HMC application extracts the
   files needed to install the corrective service. If you are
   using USB flash media, copy the \*.iso file to the flash
   media, and then select the file when prompted.
4. The **updhmc** command line command has also been
   modified to use the \*.iso file. To use the command, follow
   the syntax in this example:

   updhmc -t s -h <myservername> -f
   </home/updates/corrrective\_service.iso> -u
   <HMC\_username> -i

In all cases, the HMC application extracts the files needed
to install the corrective service.
