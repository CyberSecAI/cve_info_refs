Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-0094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Windows kernel-mode driver (specifically Win32k), where it improperly handles objects in memory. This improper handling leads to a use-after-free condition when dealing with bitmaps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning the driver attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This occurs due to incorrect management of bitmap objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges on the system. By running arbitrary code in kernel mode, they can install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The exploit can also trigger crashes, leading to a denial of service, particularly in Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system initially.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must then execute a specially crafted application that triggers the memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid user account on the target system to log in.
- They must be able to execute a custom application on the system.

**Additional Details**

- The exploit on exploit-db is listed as a DOS, and specifically crashes Windows 7 with special pool enabled on win32k.sys

- The vulnerability is related to how Windows handles bitmaps, and it can be triggered in multiple different ways.
- The exploit code is available in the form of proof-of-concept.

- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited prior to the bulletin's release.
