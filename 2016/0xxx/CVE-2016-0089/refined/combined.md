## Security Update for Windows Hyper-V (3143118)

Published: April 12, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an authenticated attacker on a guest operating system runs a specially crafted application that causes the Hyper-V host operating system to execute arbitrary code. Customers who have not enabled the Hyper-V role are not affected.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows 10 for x64-based Systems. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Hyper-V validates guest operating system user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3143118](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3143118).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

## Update FAQ

**I do not have Hyper-V enabled, why am I being offered this update?**

The vulnerable code exists in the affected software that is listed in the affected software table. As a defense-in-depth measure, and to ensure that systems are protected if Hyper-V is enabled, the update is applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable code.

## Vulnerability Information

## Hyper-V Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0088

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application on a guest operating system that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to execute arbitrary code. Customers who have not enabled the Hyper-V role are not affected.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Hyper-V validates guest operating system user input.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* Customers who have not enabled the Hyper-V role are not affected.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Multiple Hyper-V Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist when Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system. To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker on a guest operating system could run a specially crafted application that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to disclose memory information. Customers who have not enabled the Hyper-V role are not affected.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain access to information on the Hyper-V host operating system. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Hyper-V validates guest operating system user input.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:
