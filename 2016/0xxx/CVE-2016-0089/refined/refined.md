- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure Vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain access to information on the Hyper-V host operating system, specifically memory information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker on a guest operating system could run a specially crafted application that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to disclose memory information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on a guest operating system. The Hyper-V role must be enabled on the host system.
