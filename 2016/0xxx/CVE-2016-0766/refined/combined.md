# E.21. Release 9.4.6

**Release date:** 2016-02-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.4.5. For information about new features in the 9.4 major release, see [Section E.27](release-9-4.html).

## E.21.1. Migration to Version 9.4.6

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.4.X.

However, if you are upgrading an installation that contains any GIN indexes that use the (non-default) jsonb\_path\_ops operator class, see the first changelog entry below.

Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.4.4, see [Section E.23](release-9-4-4.html).

## E.21.2. Changes

* Fix inconsistent hash calculations in jsonb\_path\_ops GIN indexes (Tom Lane)

  When processing jsonb values that contain both scalars and sub-objects at the same nesting level, for example an array containing both scalars and sub-arrays, key hash values could be calculated differently than they would be for the same key in a different context. This could result in queries not finding entries that they should find. Fixing this means that existing indexes may now be inconsistent with the new hash calculation code. Users should REINDEX jsonb\_path\_ops GIN indexes after installing this update to make sure that all searches work as expected.
* Fix infinite loops and buffer-overrun problems in regular expressions (Tom Lane)

  Very large character ranges in bracket expressions could cause infinite loops in some cases, and memory overwrites in other cases. (CVE-2016-0773)
* Perform an immediate shutdown if the postmaster.pid file is removed (Tom Lane)

  The postmaster now checks every minute or so that postmaster.pid is still there and still contains its own PID. If not, it performs an immediate shutdown, as though it had received SIGQUIT. The main motivation for this change is to ensure that failed buildfarm runs will get cleaned up without manual intervention; but it also serves to limit the bad effects if a DBA forcibly removes postmaster.pid and then starts a new postmaster.
* In SERIALIZABLE transaction isolation mode, serialization anomalies could be missed due to race conditions during insertions (Kevin Grittner, Thomas Munro)
* Fix failure to emit appropriate WAL records when doing ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE for unlogged relations (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)

  Even though the relation's data is unlogged, the move must be logged or the relation will be inaccessible after a standby is promoted to master.
* Fix possible misinitialization of unlogged relations at the end of crash recovery (Andres Freund, Michael Paquier)
* Ensure walsender slots are fully re-initialized when being re-used (Magnus Hagander)
* Fix ALTER COLUMN TYPE to reconstruct inherited check constraints properly (Tom Lane)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED to change ownership of composite types properly (Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED and ALTER OWNER to correctly update granted-permissions lists when changing owners of data types, foreign data wrappers, or foreign servers (Bruce Momjian, Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED to ignore foreign user mappings, rather than fail (Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix possible crash after doing query rewrite for an updatable view (Stephen Frost)
* Fix planner's handling of LATERAL references (Tom Lane)

  This fixes some corner cases that led to "failed to build any N-way joins" or "could not devise a query plan" planner failures.
* Add more defenses against bad planner cost estimates for GIN index scans when the index's internal statistics are very out-of-date (Tom Lane)
* Make planner cope with hypothetical GIN indexes suggested by an index advisor plug-in (Julien Rouhaud)
* Speed up generation of unique table aliases in EXPLAIN and rule dumping, and ensure that generated aliases do not exceed NAMEDATALEN (Tom Lane)
* Fix dumping of whole-row Vars in ROW() and VALUES() lists (Tom Lane)
* Translation of minus-infinity dates and timestamps to json or jsonb incorrectly rendered them as plus-infinity (Tom Lane)
* Fix possible internal overflow in numeric division (Dean Rasheed)
* Fix enforcement of restrictions inside parentheses within regular expression lookahead constraints (Tom Lane)

  Lookahead constraints aren't allowed to contain backrefs, and parentheses within them are always considered non-capturing, according to the manual. However, the code failed to handle these cases properly inside a parenthesized subexpression, and would give unexpected results.
* Conversion of regular expressions to indexscan bounds could produce incorrect bounds from regexps containing lookahead constraints (Tom Lane)
* Fix regular-expression compiler to handle loops of constraint arcs (Tom Lane)

  The code added for CVE-2007-4772 was both incomplete, in that it didn't handle loops involving more than one state, and incorrect, in that it could cause assertion failures (though there seem to be no bad consequences of that in a non-assert build). Multi-state loops would cause the compiler to run until the query was canceled or it reached the too-many-states error condition.
* Improve memory-usage accounting in regular-expression compiler (Tom Lane)

  This causes the code to emit "regular expression is too complex" errors in some cases that previously used unreasonable amounts of time and memory.
* Improve performance of regular-expression compiler (Tom Lane)
* Make %h and %r escapes in log\_line\_prefix work for messages emitted due to log\_connections (Tom Lane)

  Previously, %h/%r started to work just after a new session had emitted the "connection received" log message; now they work for that message too.
* On Windows, ensure the shared-memory mapping handle gets closed in child processes that don't need it (Tom Lane, Amit Kapila)

  This oversight resulted in failure to recover from crashes whenever logging\_collector is turned on.
* Fix possible failure to detect socket EOF in non-blocking mode on Windows (Tom Lane)

  It's not entirely clear whether this problem can happen in pre-9.5 branches, but if it did, the symptom would be that a walsender process would wait indefinitely rather than noticing a loss of connection.
* Avoid leaking a token handle during SSPI authentication (Christian Ullrich)
* In psql, ensure that libreadline's idea of the screen size is updated when the terminal window size changes (Merlin Moncure)

  Previously, libreadline did not notice if the window was resized during query output, leading to strange behavior during later input of multiline queries.
* Fix psql's \det command to interpret its pattern argument the same way as other \d commands with potentially schema-qualified patterns do (Reece Hart)
* Avoid possible crash in psql's \c command when previous connection was via Unix socket and command specifies a new hostname and same username (Tom Lane)
* In pg\_ctl start -w, test child process status directly rather than relying on heuristics (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  Previously, pg\_ctl relied on an assumption that the new postmaster would always create postmaster.pid within five seconds. But that can fail on heavily-loaded systems, causing pg\_ctl to report incorrectly that the postmaster failed to start.

  Except on Windows, this change also means that a pg\_ctl start -w done immediately after another such command will now reliably fail, whereas previously it would report success if done within two seconds of the first command.
* In pg\_ctl start -w, don't attempt to use a wildcard listen address to connect to the postmaster (Kondo Yuta)

  On Windows, pg\_ctl would fail to detect postmaster startup if listen\_addresses is set to 0.0.0.0 or ::, because it would try to use that value verbatim as the address to connect to, which doesn't work. Instead assume that 127.0.0.1 or ::1, respectively, is the right thing to use.
* In pg\_ctl on Windows, check service status to decide where to send output, rather than checking if standard output is a terminal (Michael Paquier)
* In pg\_dump and pg\_basebackup, adopt the GNU convention for handling tar-archive members exceeding 8GB (Tom Lane)

  The POSIX standard for tar file format does not allow archive member files to exceed 8GB, but most modern implementations of tar support an extension that fixes that. Adopt this extension so that pg\_dump with -Ft no longer fails on tables with more than 8GB of data, and so that pg\_basebackup can handle files larger than 8GB. In addition, fix some portability issues that could cause failures for members between 4GB and 8GB on some platforms. Potentially these problems could cause unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup files.
* Fix assorted corner-case bugs in pg\_dump's processing of extension member objects (Tom Lane)
* Make pg\_dump mark a view's triggers as needing to be processed after its rule, to prevent possible failure during parallel pg\_restore (Tom Lane)
* Ensure that relation option values are properly quoted in pg\_dump (Kouhei Sutou, Tom Lane)

  A reloption value that isn't a simple identifier or number could lead to dump/reload failures due to syntax errors in CREATE statements issued by pg\_dump. This is not an issue with any reloption currently supported by core PostgreSQL, but extensions could allow reloptions that cause the problem.
* Avoid repeated password prompts during parallel pg\_dump (Zeus Kronion)
* Fix pg\_upgrade's file-copying code to handle errors properly on Windows (Bruce Momjian)
* Install guards in pgbench against corner-case overflow conditions during evaluation of script-specified division or modulo operators (Fabien Coelho, Michael Paquier)
* Fix failure to localize messages emitted by pg\_receivexlog and pg\_recvlogical (Ioseph Kim)
* Avoid dump/reload problems when using both plpython2 and plpython3 (Tom Lane)

  In principle, both versions of PL/Python can be used in the same database, though not in the same session (because the two versions of libpython cannot safely be used concurrently). However, pg\_restore and pg\_upgrade both do things that can fall foul of the same-session restriction. Work around that by changing the timing of the check.
* Fix PL/Python regression tests to pass with Python 3.5 (Peter Eisentraut)
* Fix premature clearing of libpq's input buffer when socket EOF is seen (Tom Lane)

  This mistake caused libpq to sometimes not report the backend's final error message before reporting "server closed the connection unexpectedly".
* Prevent certain PL/Java parameters from being set by non-superusers (Noah Misch)

  This change mitigates a PL/Java security bug (CVE-2016-0766), which was fixed in PL/Java by marking these parameters as superuser-only. To fix the security hazard for sites that update PostgreSQL more frequently than PL/Java, make the core code aware of them also.
* Improve libpq's handling of out-of-memory situations (Michael Paquier, Amit Kapila, Heikki Linnakangas)
* Fix order of arguments in ecpg-generated typedef statements (Michael Meskes)
* Use %g not %f format in ecpg's `PGTYPESnumeric_from_double()` (Tom Lane)
* Fix ecpg-supplied header files to not contain comments continued from a preprocessor directive line onto the next line (Michael Meskes)

  Such a comment is rejected by ecpg. It's not yet clear whether ecpg itself should be changed.
* Fix `hstore_to_json_loose()`'s test for whether an hstore value can be converted to a JSON number (Tom Lane)

  Previously this function could be fooled by non-alphanumeric trailing characters, leading to emitting syntactically-invalid JSON.
* Ensure that contrib/pgcrypto's `crypt()` function can be interrupted by query cancel (Andreas Karlsson)
* In contrib/postgres\_fdw, fix bugs triggered by use of tableoid in data-modifying commands (Etsuro Fujita, Robert Haas)
* Accept flex versions later than 2.5.x (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  Now that flex 2.6.0 has been released, the version checks in our build scripts needed to be adjusted.
* Improve reproducibility of build output by ensuring filenames are given to the linker in a fixed order (Christoph Berg)

  This avoids possible bitwise differences in the produced executable files from one build to the next.
* Install our missing script where PGXS builds can find it (Jim Nasby)

  This allows sane behavior in a PGXS build done on a machine where build tools such as bison are missing.
* Ensure that dynloader.h is included in the installed header files in MSVC builds (Bruce Momjian, Michael Paquier)
* Add variant regression test expected-output file to match behavior of current libxml2 (Tom Lane)

  The fix for libxml2's CVE-2015-7499 causes it not to output error context reports in some cases where it used to do so. This seems to be a bug, but we'll probably have to live with it for some time, so work around it.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016a for DST law changes in Cayman Islands, Metlakatla, and Trans-Baikal Territory (Zabaykalsky Krai), plus historical corrections for Pakistan.

# E.25. Release 9.5.1

**Release date:** 2016-02-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.5.0. For information about new features in the 9.5 major release, see [Section E.26](release-9-5.html).

## E.25.1. Migration to Version 9.5.1

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.5.X.

## E.25.2. Changes

* Fix infinite loops and buffer-overrun problems in regular expressions (Tom Lane)

  Very large character ranges in bracket expressions could cause infinite loops in some cases, and memory overwrites in other cases. (CVE-2016-0773)
* Fix an oversight that caused hash joins to miss joining to some tuples of the inner relation in rare cases (Tomas Vondra, Tom Lane)
* Avoid pushdown of HAVING clauses when grouping sets are used (Andrew Gierth)
* Fix deparsing of ON CONFLICT arbiter WHERE clauses (Peter Geoghegan)
* Make %h and %r escapes in log\_line\_prefix work for messages emitted due to log\_connections (Tom Lane)

  Previously, %h/%r started to work just after a new session had emitted the "connection received" log message; now they work for that message too.
* Avoid leaking a token handle during SSPI authentication (Christian Ullrich)
* Fix psql's \det command to interpret its pattern argument the same way as other \d commands with potentially schema-qualified patterns do (Reece Hart)
* In pg\_ctl on Windows, check service status to decide where to send output, rather than checking if standard output is a terminal (Michael Paquier)
* Fix assorted corner-case bugs in pg\_dump's processing of extension member objects (Tom Lane)
* Fix improper quoting of domain constraint names in pg\_dump (Elvis Pranskevichus)
* Make pg\_dump mark a view's triggers as needing to be processed after its rule, to prevent possible failure during parallel pg\_restore (Tom Lane)
* Install guards in pgbench against corner-case overflow conditions during evaluation of script-specified division or modulo operators (Fabien Coelho, Michael Paquier)
* Suppress useless warning message when pg\_receivexlog connects to a pre-9.4 server (Marco Nenciarini)
* Avoid dump/reload problems when using both plpython2 and plpython3 (Tom Lane)

  In principle, both versions of PL/Python can be used in the same database, though not in the same session (because the two versions of libpython cannot safely be used concurrently). However, pg\_restore and pg\_upgrade both do things that can fall foul of the same-session restriction. Work around that by changing the timing of the check.
* Fix PL/Python regression tests to pass with Python 3.5 (Peter Eisentraut)
* Prevent certain PL/Java parameters from being set by non-superusers (Noah Misch)

  This change mitigates a PL/Java security bug (CVE-2016-0766), which was fixed in PL/Java by marking these parameters as superuser-only. To fix the security hazard for sites that update PostgreSQL more frequently than PL/Java, make the core code aware of them also.
* Fix ecpg-supplied header files to not contain comments continued from a preprocessor directive line onto the next line (Michael Meskes)

  Such a comment is rejected by ecpg. It's not yet clear whether ecpg itself should be changed.
* Fix `hstore_to_json_loose()`'s test for whether an hstore value can be converted to a JSON number (Tom Lane)

  Previously this function could be fooled by non-alphanumeric trailing characters, leading to emitting syntactically-invalid JSON.
* In contrib/postgres\_fdw, fix bugs triggered by use of tableoid in data-modifying commands (Etsuro Fujita, Robert Haas)
* Fix ill-advised restriction of NAMEDATALEN to be less than 256 (Robert Haas, Tom Lane)
* Improve reproducibility of build output by ensuring filenames are given to the linker in a fixed order (Christoph Berg)

  This avoids possible bitwise differences in the produced executable files from one build to the next.
* Ensure that dynloader.h is included in the installed header files in MSVC builds (Bruce Momjian, Michael Paquier)
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016a for DST law changes in Cayman Islands, Metlakatla, and Trans-Baikal Territory (Zabaykalsky Krai), plus historical corrections for Pakistan.

# 2016-02-11 Security Update Release

Posted on **2016-02-11** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 9.5.1, 9.4.6, 9.3.11, 9.2.15, and 9.1.20. This release fixes two security issues, as well as several bugs found over the last four months. Users vulnerable to the security issues should update their installations immediately; other users should update at the next scheduled downtime.

## Security Fixes for Regular Expressions, PL/Java

This release closes security hole [CVE-2016-0773](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0773), an issue with regular expression (regex) parsing. Prior code allowed users to pass in expressions which included out-of-range Unicode characters, triggering a backend crash. This issue is critical for PostgreSQL systems with untrusted users or which generate regexes based on user input.

The update also fixes [CVE-2016-0766](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0766), a privilege escalation issue for users of PL/Java. Certain custom configuration settings (GUCS) for PL/Java will now be modifiable only by the database superuser.

## Other Fixes and Improvements

In addition to the above, many other issues were patched in this release based on bugs reported by our users over the last few months. This includes multiple fixes for new features introduced in version 9.5.0, as well as refactoring of pg\_dump to eliminate a number of chronic issues with backing up EXTENSIONs. Among them are:

* Fix many issues in pg\_dump with specific object types
* Prevent over-eager pushdown of HAVING clauses for GROUPING SETS
* Fix deparsing error with ON CONFLICT ... WHERE clauses
* Fix tableoid errors for postgres\_fdw
* Prevent floating-point exceptions in pgbench
* Make \det search Foreign Table names consistently
* Fix quoting of domain constraint names in pg\_dump
* Prevent putting expanded objects into Const nodes
* Allow compile of PL/Java on Windows
* Fix "unresolved symbol" errors in PL/Python execution
* Allow Python2 and Python3 to be used in the same database
* Add support for Python 3.5 in PL/Python
* Fix issue with subdirectory creation during initdb
* Make pg\_ctl report status correctly on Windows
* Suppress confusing error when using pg\_receivexlog with older servers
* Multiple documentation corrections and additions
* Fix erroneous hash calculations in gin\_extract\_jsonb\_path()

This update also contains tzdata release 2016a, with updates for Cayman Islands, Metlakatla, Trans-Baikal Territory
(Zabaykalsky Krai), and Pakistan.

## Updating

Users of version 9.4 will need to reindex any jsonb\_path\_ops indexes they have created, in order to fix a persistent issue with missing index entries. Users of other versions who have skipped multiple update releases may need to perform additional post-update steps; see the Release Notes for details.

All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use pg\_upgrade in order to apply this update release; you may simply shut down PostgreSQL and update its binaries.

# E.10. Release 9.2.15

**Release date:** 2016-02-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.2.14. For
information about new features in the 9.2 major release, see
[Section E.25](release-9-2.html).

## E.10.1. Migration to Version 9.2.15

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.2.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
9.2.11, see [Section E.14](release-9-2-11.html).

## E.10.2. Changes

* Fix infinite loops and buffer-overrun problems in
  regular expressions (Tom Lane)

  Very large character ranges in bracket expressions could
  cause infinite loops in some cases, and memory overwrites
  in other cases. (CVE-2016-0773)
* Perform an immediate shutdown if the postmaster.pid file is removed (Tom
  Lane)

  The postmaster now checks every minute or so that
  postmaster.pid is still there and
  still contains its own PID. If not, it performs an
  immediate shutdown, as though it had received SIGQUIT. The main motivation for this
  change is to ensure that failed buildfarm runs will get
  cleaned up without manual intervention; but it also serves
  to limit the bad effects if a DBA forcibly removes
  postmaster.pid and then starts a
  new postmaster.
* In SERIALIZABLE transaction
  isolation mode, serialization anomalies could be missed due
  to race conditions during insertions (Kevin Grittner,
  Thomas Munro)
* Fix failure to emit appropriate WAL records when doing
  ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE for
  unlogged relations (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)

  Even though the relation's data is unlogged, the move
  must be logged or the relation will be inaccessible after a
  standby is promoted to master.
* Fix possible misinitialization of unlogged relations at
  the end of crash recovery (Andres Freund, Michael
  Paquier)
* Fix ALTER COLUMN TYPE to
  reconstruct inherited check constraints properly (Tom
  Lane)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED to change
  ownership of composite types properly (Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED and
  ALTER OWNER to correctly update
  granted-permissions lists when changing owners of data
  types, foreign data wrappers, or foreign servers (Bruce
  Momjian, Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED to ignore
  foreign user mappings, rather than fail (Álvaro
  Herrera)
* Add more defenses against bad planner cost estimates for
  GIN index scans when the index's internal statistics are
  very out-of-date (Tom Lane)
* Make planner cope with hypothetical GIN indexes
  suggested by an index advisor plug-in (Julien Rouhaud)
* Fix dumping of whole-row Vars in ROW() and VALUES()
  lists (Tom Lane)
* Fix possible internal overflow in numeric division (Dean Rasheed)
* Fix enforcement of restrictions inside parentheses
  within regular expression lookahead constraints (Tom
  Lane)

  Lookahead constraints aren't allowed to contain
  backrefs, and parentheses within them are always considered
  non-capturing, according to the manual. However, the code
  failed to handle these cases properly inside a
  parenthesized subexpression, and would give unexpected
  results.
* Conversion of regular expressions to indexscan bounds
  could produce incorrect bounds from regexps containing
  lookahead constraints (Tom Lane)
* Fix regular-expression compiler to handle loops of
  constraint arcs (Tom Lane)

  The code added for CVE-2007-4772 was both incomplete, in
  that it didn't handle loops involving more than one state,
  and incorrect, in that it could cause assertion failures
  (though there seem to be no bad consequences of that in a
  non-assert build). Multi-state loops would cause the
  compiler to run until the query was canceled or it reached
  the too-many-states error condition.
* Improve memory-usage accounting in regular-expression
  compiler (Tom Lane)

  This causes the code to emit "regular expression is too complex" errors
  in some cases that previously used unreasonable amounts of
  time and memory.
* Improve performance of regular-expression compiler (Tom
  Lane)
* Make %h and %r escapes in log\_line\_prefix work for messages emitted
  due to log\_connections (Tom
  Lane)

  Previously, %h/%r started to work just after a new session
  had emitted the "connection
  received" log message; now they work for that
  message too.
* On Windows, ensure the shared-memory mapping handle gets
  closed in child processes that don't need it (Tom Lane,
  Amit Kapila)

  This oversight resulted in failure to recover from
  crashes whenever logging\_collector
  is turned on.
* Fix possible failure to detect socket EOF in
  non-blocking mode on Windows (Tom Lane)

  It's not entirely clear whether this problem can happen
  in pre-9.5 branches, but if it did, the symptom would be
  that a walsender process would wait indefinitely rather
  than noticing a loss of connection.
* Avoid leaking a token handle during SSPI authentication
  (Christian Ullrich)
* In psql, ensure that
  libreadline's idea of the
  screen size is updated when the terminal window size
  changes (Merlin Moncure)

  Previously, libreadline
  did not notice if the window was resized during query
  output, leading to strange behavior during later input of
  multiline queries.
* Fix psql's \det command to interpret its pattern
  argument the same way as other \d
  commands with potentially schema-qualified patterns do
  (Reece Hart)
* Avoid possible crash in psql's \c
  command when previous connection was via Unix socket and
  command specifies a new hostname and same username (Tom
  Lane)
* In pg\_ctl start -w, test child
  process status directly rather than relying on heuristics
  (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  Previously, pg\_ctl
  relied on an assumption that the new postmaster would
  always create postmaster.pid
  within five seconds. But that can fail on heavily-loaded
  systems, causing pg\_ctl to
  report incorrectly that the postmaster failed to start.

  Except on Windows, this change also means that a
  pg\_ctl start -w done immediately
  after another such command will now reliably fail, whereas
  previously it would report success if done within two
  seconds of the first command.
* In pg\_ctl start -w, don't
  attempt to use a wildcard listen address to connect to the
  postmaster (Kondo Yuta)

  On Windows, pg\_ctl
  would fail to detect postmaster startup if listen\_addresses is set to 0.0.0.0 or ::,
  because it would try to use that value verbatim as the
  address to connect to, which doesn't work. Instead assume
  that 127.0.0.1 or ::1, respectively, is the right thing to
  use.
* In pg\_ctl on Windows,
  check service status to decide where to send output, rather
  than checking if standard output is a terminal (Michael
  Paquier)
* In pg\_dump and
  pg\_basebackup, adopt the
  GNU convention for handling tar-archive members exceeding
  8GB (Tom Lane)

  The POSIX standard for tar file
  format does not allow archive member files to exceed 8GB,
  but most modern implementations of tar support an extension that fixes
  that. Adopt this extension so that pg\_dump with -Ft no longer fails on tables with more than
  8GB of data, and so that pg\_basebackup can handle files larger
  than 8GB. In addition, fix some portability issues that
  could cause failures for members between 4GB and 8GB on
  some platforms. Potentially these problems could cause
  unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup files.
* Fix assorted corner-case bugs in pg\_dump's processing of extension
  member objects (Tom Lane)
* Make pg\_dump mark a
  view's triggers as needing to be processed after its rule,
  to prevent possible failure during parallel pg\_restore (Tom Lane)
* Ensure that relation option values are properly quoted
  in pg\_dump (Kouhei Sutou,
  Tom Lane)

  A reloption value that isn't a simple identifier or
  number could lead to dump/reload failures due to syntax
  errors in CREATE statements issued by pg\_dump. This is not an issue with any
  reloption currently supported by core PostgreSQL, but extensions could allow
  reloptions that cause the problem.
* Fix pg\_upgrade's
  file-copying code to handle errors properly on Windows
  (Bruce Momjian)
* Install guards in pgbench against corner-case overflow
  conditions during evaluation of script-specified division
  or modulo operators (Fabien Coelho, Michael Paquier)
* Fix failure to localize messages emitted by pg\_receivexlog and pg\_recvlogical (Ioseph Kim)
* Avoid dump/reload problems when using both plpython2 and plpython3 (Tom Lane)

  In principle, both versions of PL/Python can be used in the same
  database, though not in the same session (because the two
  versions of libpython
  cannot safely be used concurrently). However, pg\_restore and pg\_upgrade both do things that can
  fall foul of the same-session restriction. Work around that
  by changing the timing of the check.
* Fix PL/Python
  regression tests to pass with Python 3.5 (Peter
  Eisentraut)
* Prevent certain PL/Java
  parameters from being set by non-superusers (Noah
  Misch)

  This change mitigates a PL/Java security bug (CVE-2016-0766),
  which was fixed in PL/Java
  by marking these parameters as superuser-only. To fix the
  security hazard for sites that update PostgreSQL more frequently than
  PL/Java, make the core
  code aware of them also.
* Improve libpq's
  handling of out-of-memory situations (Michael Paquier, Amit
  Kapila, Heikki Linnakangas)
* Fix order of arguments in ecpg-generated typedef statements (Michael Meskes)
* Use %g not %f format in ecpg's `PGTYPESnumeric_from_double()` (Tom
  Lane)
* Fix ecpg-supplied
  header files to not contain comments continued from a
  preprocessor directive line onto the next line (Michael
  Meskes)

  Such a comment is rejected by ecpg. It's not yet clear whether
  ecpg itself should be
  changed.
* Ensure that contrib/pgcrypto's
  `crypt()` function can be
  interrupted by query cancel (Andreas Karlsson)
* Accept flex versions
  later than 2.5.x (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  Now that flex 2.6.0 has been released, the version
  checks in our build scripts needed to be adjusted.
* Install our missing script
  where PGXS builds can find it (Jim Nasby)

  This allows sane behavior in a PGXS build done on a
  machine where build tools such as bison are missing.
* Ensure that dynloader.h is
  included in the installed header files in MSVC builds
  (Bruce Momjian, Michael Paquier)
* Add variant regression test expected-output file to
  match behavior of current libxml2 (Tom Lane)

  The fix for libxml2's
  CVE-2015-7499 causes it not to output error context reports
  in some cases where it used to do so. This seems to be a
  bug, but we'll probably have to live with it for some time,
  so work around it.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016a for DST law
  changes in Cayman Islands, Metlakatla, and Trans-Baikal
  Territory (Zabaykalsky Krai), plus historical corrections
  for Pakistan.

Package        : postgresql-9.4
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-0766 CVE-2016-0773

Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.4, a SQL
database system.

CVE-2016-0766

    A privilege escalation vulnerability for users of PL/Java was
    discovered. Certain custom configuration settings (GUCs) for PL/Java
    will now be modifiable only by the database superuser to mitigate
    this issue.

CVE-2016-0773

    Tom Lane and Greg Stark discovered a flaw in the way PostgreSQL
    processes specially crafted regular expressions. Very large
    character ranges in bracket expressions could cause infinite
    loops or memory overwrites. A remote attacker can exploit this
    flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, to execute
    arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.6-0+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.4 packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=949670#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-10-09 08:14:01 UTC  ``` from <http://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1615/>  2015-10-08 Security Update Release Posted on Oct. 8, 2015  The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 9.4.5, 9.3.10, 9.2.14, 9.1.19 and 9.0.23. This release fixes two security issues, as well as several bugs found over the last four months. Users vulnerable to the security issues should update their installations immediately; other users should update at the next scheduled downtime. This is also the final update release for major version 9.0. Security Fixes  Two security issues have been fixed in this release which affect users of specific PostgreSQL features:  CVE-2015-5289: json or jsonb input values constructed from arbitrary user input can crash the PostgreSQL server and cause a denial of service.  [...]  Details from <http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/>  CVE-2015-5289 Affected versions: 9.4, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1, 9.0 Fixed in: 9.4.5, 9.3.10, 9.2.14, 9.1.19, 9.0.23 Component: core server Class: D (A vulnerability that is exploitable for denial-of-service, but requiring a valid prior login.)

Package        : postgresql-9.1
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5288 CVE-2016-0766 CVE-2016-0773

Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.1, a SQL
database system.

CVE-2015-5288

    Josh Kupershmidt discovered a vulnerability in the crypt() function
    in the pgCrypto extension. Certain invalid salt arguments can cause
    the server to crash or to disclose a few bytes of server memory.

CVE-2016-0766

    A privilege escalation vulnerability for users of PL/Java was
    discovered. Certain custom configuration settings (GUCs) for PL/Java
    will now be modifiable only by the database superuser to mitigate
    this issue.

CVE-2016-0773

    Tom Lane and Greg Stark discovered a flaw in the way PostgreSQL
    processes specially crafted regular expressions. Very large
    character ranges in bracket expressions could cause infinite
    loops or memory overwrites. A remote attacker can exploit this
    flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, to execute
    arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.1.20-0+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

This release fixes two security issues, as well as several bugs found over the last four months. Users vulnerable to the security issues should update their installations immediately; other users should update at the next scheduled downtime. This is also the final update release for major version 9.0. Security Fixes  Two security issues have been fixed in this release which affect users of specific PostgreSQL features:  [...]  CVE-2015-5288: The crypt() function included with the optional pgCrypto extension could be exploited to read a few additional bytes of memory. No working exploit for this issue has been developed.  Details from <http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/>  CVE-2015-5288 Affected versions: 9.4, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1, 9.0 Fixed in: 9.4.5, 9.3.10, 9.2.14, 9.1.19, 9.0.23 Component: contrib module Class: C (A vulnerabilty that is exploitable for privilege escalation, but requiring a valid prior login.) Description: Memory leak in crypt() function. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=949669#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2015-10-09 09:12:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 650900](attachment.cgi?id=650900&action=diff "upstream commit 1d812c8b059d0b9b1fba4a459c9876de0f6259b6") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=650900&action=edit "upstream commit 1d812c8b059d0b9b1fba4a459c9876de0f6259b6") upstream commit 1d812c8b059d0b9b1fba4a459c9876de0f6259b6  <http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=1d812c8b059d0b9b1fba4a459c9876de0f6259b6>  commit 1d812c8b059d0b9b1fba4a459c9876de0f6259b6 Author: Noah Misch <noah@leadboat.com> Date:   Mon Oct 5 10:06:29 2015 -0400      pgcrypto: Detect and report too-short crypt() salts.

# E.15. Release 9.3.11

**Release date:** 2016-02-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.3.10. For
information about new features in the 9.3 major release, see
[Section E.26](release-9-3.html).

## E.15.1. Migration to Version 9.3.11

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.3.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.3.9,
see [Section E.17](release-9-3-9.html).

## E.15.2. Changes

* Fix infinite loops and buffer-overrun problems in regular
  expressions (Tom Lane)

  Very large character ranges in bracket expressions could cause
  infinite loops in some cases, and memory overwrites in other cases.
  (CVE-2016-0773)
* Perform an immediate shutdown if the postmaster.pid file is removed (Tom Lane)

  The postmaster now checks every minute or so that postmaster.pid is still there and still contains
  its own PID. If not, it performs an immediate shutdown, as though
  it had received SIGQUIT. The main
  motivation for this change is to ensure that failed buildfarm runs
  will get cleaned up without manual intervention; but it also serves
  to limit the bad effects if a DBA forcibly removes postmaster.pid and then starts a new
  postmaster.
* In SERIALIZABLE transaction isolation
  mode, serialization anomalies could be missed due to race
  conditions during insertions (Kevin Grittner, Thomas Munro)
* Fix failure to emit appropriate WAL records when doing
  ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE for
  unlogged relations (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)

  Even though the relation's data is unlogged, the move must be
  logged or the relation will be inaccessible after a standby is
  promoted to master.
* Fix possible misinitialization of unlogged relations at the end
  of crash recovery (Andres Freund, Michael Paquier)
* Ensure walsender slots are fully re-initialized when being
  re-used (Magnus Hagander)
* Fix ALTER COLUMN TYPE to reconstruct
  inherited check constraints properly (Tom Lane)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED to change ownership
  of composite types properly (Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED and ALTER OWNER to correctly update granted-permissions
  lists when changing owners of data types, foreign data wrappers, or
  foreign servers (Bruce Momjian, Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix REASSIGN OWNED to ignore foreign
  user mappings, rather than fail (Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix possible crash after doing query rewrite for an updatable
  view (Stephen Frost)
* Fix planner's handling of LATERAL
  references (Tom Lane)

  This fixes some corner cases that led to "failed to build any N-way joins" or "could not devise a query plan" planner
  failures.
* Add more defenses against bad planner cost estimates for GIN
  index scans when the index's internal statistics are very
  out-of-date (Tom Lane)
* Make planner cope with hypothetical GIN indexes suggested by an
  index advisor plug-in (Julien Rouhaud)
* Speed up generation of unique table aliases in EXPLAIN and rule dumping, and ensure that generated
  aliases do not exceed NAMEDATALEN (Tom
  Lane)
* Fix dumping of whole-row Vars in ROW()
  and VALUES() lists (Tom Lane)
* Fix possible internal overflow in numeric
  division (Dean Rasheed)
* Fix enforcement of restrictions inside parentheses within
  regular expression lookahead constraints (Tom Lane)

  Lookahead constraints aren't allowed to contain backrefs, and
  parentheses within them are always considered non-capturing,
  according to the manual. However, the code failed to handle these
  cases properly inside a parenthesized subexpression, and would give
  unexpected results.
* Conversion of regular expressions to indexscan bounds could
  produce incorrect bounds from regexps containing lookahead
  constraints (Tom Lane)
* Fix regular-expression compiler to handle loops of constraint
  arcs (Tom Lane)

  The code added for CVE-2007-4772 was both incomplete, in that it
  didn't handle loops involving more than one state, and incorrect,
  in that it could cause assertion failures (though there seem to be
  no bad consequences of that in a non-assert build). Multi-state
  loops would cause the compiler to run until the query was canceled
  or it reached the too-many-states error condition.
* Improve memory-usage accounting in regular-expression compiler
  (Tom Lane)

  This causes the code to emit "regular
  expression is too complex" errors in some cases that
  previously used unreasonable amounts of time and memory.
* Improve performance of regular-expression compiler (Tom
  Lane)
* Make %h and %r
  escapes in log\_line\_prefix work for
  messages emitted due to log\_connections
  (Tom Lane)

  Previously, %h/%r started to work just after a new session had
  emitted the "connection received" log
  message; now they work for that message too.
* On Windows, ensure the shared-memory mapping handle gets closed
  in child processes that don't need it (Tom Lane, Amit Kapila)

  This oversight resulted in failure to recover from crashes
  whenever logging\_collector is turned
  on.
* Fix possible failure to detect socket EOF in non-blocking mode
  on Windows (Tom Lane)

  It's not entirely clear whether this problem can happen in
  pre-9.5 branches, but if it did, the symptom would be that a
  walsender process would wait indefinitely rather than noticing a
  loss of connection.
* Avoid leaking a token handle during SSPI authentication
  (Christian Ullrich)
* In psql, ensure that
  libreadline's idea of the screen
  size is updated when the terminal window size changes (Merlin
  Moncure)

  Previously, libreadline did not
  notice if the window was resized during query output, leading to
  strange behavior during later input of multiline queries.
* Fix psql's \det command to interpret its pattern argument the
  same way as other \d commands with
  potentially schema-qualified patterns do (Reece Hart)
* Avoid possible crash in psql's
  \c command when previous connection was
  via Unix socket and command specifies a new hostname and same
  username (Tom Lane)
* In pg\_ctl start -w, test child process
  status directly rather than relying on heuristics (Tom Lane,
  Michael Paquier)

  Previously, pg\_ctl relied on an
  assumption that the new postmaster would always create postmaster.pid within five seconds. But that can
  fail on heavily-loaded systems, causing pg\_ctl to report incorrectly that the
  postmaster failed to start.

  Except on Windows, this change also means that a pg\_ctl start -w done immediately after another such
  command will now reliably fail, whereas previously it would report
  success if done within two seconds of the first command.
* In pg\_ctl start -w, don't attempt to
  use a wildcard listen address to connect to the postmaster (Kondo
  Yuta)

  On Windows, pg\_ctl would fail
  to detect postmaster startup if listen\_addresses is set to 0.0.0.0 or ::, because it
  would try to use that value verbatim as the address to connect to,
  which doesn't work. Instead assume that 127.0.0.1 or ::1,
  respectively, is the right thing to use.
* In pg\_ctl on Windows, check
  service status to decide where to send output, rather than checking
  if standard output is a terminal (Michael Paquier)
* In pg\_dump and pg\_basebackup, adopt the GNU convention for
  handling tar-archive members exceeding 8GB (Tom Lane)

  The POSIX standard for tar file format
  does not allow archive member files to exceed 8GB, but most modern
  implementations of tar support an
  extension that fixes that. Adopt this extension so that
  pg\_dump with -Ft no longer fails on tables with more than 8GB of
  data, and so that pg\_basebackup
  can handle files larger than 8GB. In addition, fix some portability
  issues that could cause failures for members between 4GB and 8GB on
  some platforms. Potentially these problems could cause
  unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup files.
* Fix assorted corner-case bugs in pg\_dump's processing of extension member
  objects (Tom Lane)
* Make pg\_dump mark a view's
  triggers as needing to be processed after its rule, to prevent
  possible failure during parallel pg\_restore (Tom Lane)
* Ensure that relation option values are properly quoted in
  pg\_dump (Kouhei Sutou, Tom
  Lane)

  A reloption value that isn't a simple identifier or number could
  lead to dump/reload failures due to syntax errors in CREATE
  statements issued by pg\_dump. This
  is not an issue with any reloption currently supported by core
  PostgreSQL, but extensions could
  allow reloptions that cause the problem.
* Avoid repeated password prompts during parallel pg\_dump (Zeus Kronion)
* Fix pg\_upgrade's file-copying
  code to handle errors properly on Windows (Bruce Momjian)
* Install guards in pgbench
  against corner-case overflow conditions during evaluation of
  script-specified division or modulo operators (Fabien Coelho,
  Michael Paquier)
* Fix failure to localize messages emitted by pg\_receivexlog and pg\_recvlogical (Ioseph Kim)
* Avoid dump/reload problems when using both plpython2 and plpython3 (Tom Lane)

  In principle, both versions of PL/Python can be used in the same database,
  though not in the same session (because the two versions of
  libpython cannot safely be used
  concurrently). However, pg\_restore
  and pg\_upgrade both do things that
  can fall foul of the same-session restriction. Work around that by
  changing the timing of the check.
* Fix PL/Python regression tests
  to pass with Python 3.5 (Peter Eisentraut)
* Fix premature clearing of libpq's input buffer when socket EOF is seen
  (Tom Lane)

  This mistake caused libpq to
  sometimes not report the backend's final error message before
  reporting "server closed the connection
  unexpectedly".
* Prevent certain PL/Java
  parameters from being set by non-superusers (Noah Misch)

  This change mitigates a PL/Java
  security bug (CVE-2016-0766), which was fixed in PL/Java by marking these parameters as
  superuser-only. To fix the security hazard for sites that update
  PostgreSQL more frequently than
  PL/Java, make the core code aware
  of them also.
* Improve libpq's handling of
  out-of-memory situations (Michael Paquier, Amit Kapila, Heikki
  Linnakangas)
* Fix order of arguments in ecpg-generated typedef statements (Michael Meskes)
* Use %g not %f
  format in ecpg's `PGTYPESnumeric_from_double()` (Tom Lane)
* Fix ecpg-supplied header files
  to not contain comments continued from a preprocessor directive
  line onto the next line (Michael Meskes)

  Such a comment is rejected by ecpg. It's not yet clear whether ecpg itself should be changed.
* Fix `hstore_to_json_loose()`'s test
  for whether an hstore value can be converted
  to a JSON number (Tom Lane)

  Previously this function could be fooled by non-alphanumeric
  trailing characters, leading to emitting syntactically-invalid
  JSON.
* Ensure that contrib/pgcrypto's
  `crypt()` function can be interrupted
  by query cancel (Andreas Karlsson)
* Accept flex versions later than
  2.5.x (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  Now that flex 2.6.0 has been released, the version checks in our
  build scripts needed to be adjusted.
* Improve reproducibility of build output by ensuring filenames
  are given to the linker in a fixed order (Christoph Berg)

  This avoids possible bitwise differences in the produced
  executable files from one build to the next.
* Install our missing script where PGXS
  builds can find it (Jim Nasby)

  This allows sane behavior in a PGXS build done on a machine
  where build tools such as bison
  are missing.
* Ensure that dynloader.h is included in
  the installed header files in MSVC builds (Bruce Momjian, Michael
  Paquier)
* Add variant regression test expected-output file to match
  behavior of current libxml2 (Tom
  Lane)

  The fix for libxml2's
  CVE-2015-7499 causes it not to output error context reports in some
  cases where it used to do so. This seems to be a bug, but we'll
  probably have to live with it for some time, so work around it.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016a for DST law changes in
  Cayman Islands, Metlakatla, and Trans-Baikal Territory (Zabaykalsky
  Krai), plus historical corrections for Pakistan.

# USN-2894-1: PostgreSQL vulnerabilities

11 February 2016

PostgreSQL could be made to crash or run programs if it handled specially
crafted data.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [postgresql-9.1](/security/cves?package=postgresql-9.1) - Object-relational SQL database
* [postgresql-9.3](/security/cves?package=postgresql-9.3) - Object-relational SQL database
* [postgresql-9.4](/security/cves?package=postgresql-9.4) - Object-relational SQL database

## Details

It was discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

PostgreSQL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-0773](/security/CVE-2016-0773))

It was discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly handled certain configuration

settings (GUCS) for users of PL/Java. A remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2016-0766](/security/CVE-2016-0766))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [postgresql-9.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.4)
  -
  [9.4.6-0ubuntu0.15.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.4/9.4.6-0ubuntu0.15.10)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [postgresql-9.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.3)
  -
  [9.3.11-0ubuntu0.14.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.3/9.3.11-0ubuntu0.14.04)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [postgresql-9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.1)
  -
  [9.1.20-0ubuntu0.12.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-9.1/9.1.20-0ubuntu0.12.04)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart PostgreSQL to

make all the necessary changes.

Sorry for that.  But anyway, as far as SLE11 goes, I submited the sources for PostgreSQL 9.4.6 only to SP1 and all later SPs of the respective releases should "inherit" the packages from there.  Marcus, can you explain why this only got released for SLE11-SP4 and no older SPs? ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=966436#c22)  Marcus Meissner   2016-03-16 17:02:41 UTC  ``` SLES 11 SP3 has left regular maintenance and support on January 31st 2016.  It has entered the 3 year LTSS phase on 2nd February.  This update happened after that time, so it is no longer released to the general support and maintenance trees of SLES 11 SP3.  We currently have no LTSS update planned, as the severity so far does not meet the LTSS release criteria.  A PTF can be requested by LTSS customers via the regular support channels.  -> issue seems done ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=966436#c27)  Josef Cejka   2016-05-18 07:03:01 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 978323](show_bug.cgi?id=978323 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c0)  Joshua Tolley   2010-02-08 19:33:29 UTC  ``` User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.299.0 Safari/532.8  On a completely new openSUSE 11.3 machine, I installed the postgresql-server, postgresql, and postgresql-plperl packages. After starting PostgreSQL and letting it initialize a new database, I sudo-d to the postgres user, and tried to add the PL/Perl language, as follows, with the error below:  postgres@linux-e16r:~> createlang plperl createlang: language installation failed: ERROR:  could not load library "/usr/lib/postgresql/plperl.so": libperl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  libperl.so lives in /usr/lib/perl5/5.10.0/i586-linux-thread-multi/CORE/libperl.so. Creating a symlink at /usr/lib/libperl.so to the installed libperl.so binary works around the problem. This also exists in at least one of the 10.x versions, though I don't have access to the servers to know the precise version(s)  As a secondary note, the description of the postgresql-plperl package, at least as it appears in YaST2, says the package also includes PL/Tcl and PL/Python. This is incorrect.  Thirdly, the documentation also claims "PostgreSQL also offers the builtin procedural language PL/SQL". This is also incorrect -- PL/SQL is an Oracle-specific language. PostgreSQL offers PL/pgSQL, which fact might be worth noting in the PL/Perl documentation, or it might not.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.install postgresql, postgresql-server, and postgresql-plperl 2.start postgresql (/etc/init.d/postgresql start) 3.become the postgres user (sudo su - postgres) 4.create the plperl language in the default database: createlang plperl Actual Results:   # createlang plperl createlang: language installation failed: ERROR:  could not load library "/usr/lib/postgresql/plperl.so": libperl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  Expected Results:   createlang should have no output, and a 0 exit status  I realize this is a packaging bug, and likely not something distributed by Novell directly. I saw nowhere else to file the bug. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c1)  Reinhard Max   2010-02-09 09:42:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c0))  > postgres@linux-e16r:~> createlang plperl > createlang: language installation failed: ERROR:  could not load library > "/usr/lib/postgresql/plperl.so": libperl.so: cannot open shared object file: No > such file or directory  I'll check that.  > As a secondary note, the description of the postgresql-plperl package, at least > as it appears in YaST2, says the package also includes PL/Tcl and PL/Python. > This is incorrect.  This is a leftover from the times when all three modules lived in a single package. The description of the other two was adjusted, but it look like I missed PL/Perl.  > Thirdly, the documentation also claims "PostgreSQL also offers the builtin > procedural language PL/SQL".

Whoops for the wrong name, I'll fix that. The mentioning in the package description also dates back to the time when PL/Perl, PL/Tcl and PL/Python came as a single package called postgresql-pl and was added so that people know that this package is not needed if all they want is PL/pgSQL. I'll leave that note in the desctiption of the postgresql-pl source package, but remove it from the language-speciffic subpackages.  > I realize this is a packaging bug, and likely not something distributed by > Novell directly. I saw nowhere else to file the bug.  Well, we do the packaging, so this is exactly the right place to complain. ;) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c2)  Reinhard Max   2010-02-09 13:45:30 UTC  ``` Fixed for Factory. New packages should soon appear here: [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database:/postgresql/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server%3A/database%3A/postgresql/) ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c3)  Joshua Tolley   2010-02-09 16:43:41 UTC  ``` Ooo... fast. I appreciate the response (unless of course I test and find it doesn't work, but I don't expect that to be the case) ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c4)  Thomas Zimmermann   2011-07-29 13:29:44 UTC  ``` This bug is back. In openSUSE 11.4 the same as Joshua Tolley has described in the discription happens again. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c5)  Reinhard Max   2011-08-18 20:45:31 UTC  ``` Doh - I only fixed the documentation part and forgot about the libperl issue. :( That's why different issues should be reported as separate bugzilla items. ;)  Anyways, here is a forum discussion that gives a bit more background on the libperl problem:  <http://dbaspot.com/postgresql/258163-libplperl-so-libperl-so.html>  Unfortunately the discussion ends abruptly without a joint solution. But as we don't use different compilers for building Perl and PostgreSQL for openSUSE, it should be safe to remove the removal of the rpath arguments from the compiler flags.  I'll commit that to Factory, which will also build backport packages for 11.4. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c6)  Reinhard Max   2011-08-18 21:53:23 UTC  ``` Unfortunately the now longer value of perl_embed_ldflags appears to confuse PostgreSQL's configure/make system and causes it to fail at a seemingly unrelated point under doc/src/sgml. Need more time to dig deeper into that... ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c7)  Reinhard Max   2011-10-05 16:44:03 UTC  ``` Finally fixed this in Factory along with the update to PostgreSQL 9.1.1. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c8)  Thomas Zimmermann   2015-12-18 10:30:44 UTC  ``` This Bug is back again.  Unfortunatly I couldn't identify how rmax fixed it and therefore was not able to find the commit which broke it again... But as the changelog says that the fix was not to remove the rpath, and this gives a rpmlint warning, i assume someone removed the fix again to "fix" the warning. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c9)  Reinhard Max   2016-02-09 17:57:51 UTC  ``` The fix was to keep PostgreSQL's autoconf scripts from removing the rpath part from the linker options that were obtained from the current Perl installation.  For the old patch, see [https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/server:database:postgresql/postgresql94/postgresql-plperl.patch?expand=1&rev=d24f55ea629cda6308a83136f7fc6ae5](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/server%3Adatabase%3Apostgresql/postgresql94/postgresql-plperl.patch?expand=1&rev=d24f55ea629cda6308a83136f7fc6ae5)  Unfortunately I misremembered the patch as being a build fix when packaging PostgreSQL 9.4 in Feb 2015 and thought it wasn't needed anymore, because the package still built without it, so I removed it.  I will re-introduce it next time I have to touch PostgreSQL 9.4 and will leave a comment in the patch and spec file to prevent accidental removals in the future. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c10)  Reinhard Max   2016-02-12 12:51:39 UTC  ``` Will get fixed along with the upcoming security update. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=578053#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-02-24 12:12:49 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2016:0555-1: An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
