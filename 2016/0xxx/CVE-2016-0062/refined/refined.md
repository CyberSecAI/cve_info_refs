Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-0062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs when Internet Explorer improperly handles text selections within an HTML document, leading to the reuse of an MSCTF!CACPWrap object in memory after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition, where a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, resulting in memory corruption and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Improper memory access due to the use-after-free can corrupt memory, which can be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **User Rights:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user.
*   **System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system. This includes:
    *   Installing programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creating new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Webpage:** The primary attack vector involves a user viewing a specially crafted webpage via Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge.
*   **Malicious File:** The user could also be tricked into opening a malicious file that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may also inject the exploit content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or distribute a malicious file.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious page or open the malicious file for the exploit to occur.
*   **No Forced Interaction:** The attacker cannot force a user to view their content but can entice them through emails, instant messages, or by compromising existing websites.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge.
*   Microsoft has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by Zheng Huang of Baidu Scloud XTeam.
