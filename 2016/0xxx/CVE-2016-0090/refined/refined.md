Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-0090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is improper input validation within the Hyper-V component when handling requests from a guest OS. This allows an attacker to potentially disclose memory information from the host OS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to information disclosure. An attacker can gain access to memory information on the Hyper-V host operating system, which could contain sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to have an account on a guest operating system running on a vulnerable Hyper-V host. The attacker then runs a specially crafted application from within the guest OS to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated on a guest operating system hosted on the vulnerable Hyper-V system. They must also be able to execute arbitrary applications on the guest OS.
