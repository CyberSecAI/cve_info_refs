    "Information": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how win32kfull.sys handles reference counting of Surface objects.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute code with kernel privileges, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application. User interaction is required, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to execute code. User interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in win32k.sys related to bitmap objects.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the system.",
      "Attack vectors": "The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) is a local attack that triggers a crash.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system is required. The provided PoC is for 32-bit Windows 7 with special pool enabled, and may require multiple runs to reproduce."

    "Information": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of objects in memory within the Windows kernel-mode driver, leading to potential elevation of privilege.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially enabling them to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attack vector, requiring an attacker to log on to the target system and then run a specially crafted application.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must have local access to the system and be able to execute a specially crafted application."
