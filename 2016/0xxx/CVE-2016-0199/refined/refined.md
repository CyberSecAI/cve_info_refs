  "CVE-2016-0199": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to a type confusion in the garbage collector of the JavaScript engine used in Internet Explorer 11. When setAttributeNode is used with an Attr node whose nodeValue is not a valid value, it replaces the nodeValue with the previous attribute value. If the Attr node is then removed via removeAttributeNode and the garbage collector runs, the garbage collector assumes the nodeValue is still an object, even if it has been changed to a string or number. This leads to the garbage collector using the string or number's data as if it were a C++ object vftable, leading to a virtual function call using attacker-controlled data.",
    "Root cause": "Type confusion in the garbage collector due to improper handling of attribute node values after they have been changed to a non-object type.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type Confusion",
      "Improper handling of object attributes",
      "Use of attacker-controlled data for vftable lookup"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution due to arbitrary virtual function call.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted webpage",
      "Triggering vulnerable code path through JavaScript"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to get a target user to open a specially crafted webpage.",
    "Affected software": [
      "Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 (all versions before June 2016 patch)"
    ]
