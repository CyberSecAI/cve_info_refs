CVE-2016-0199 / MS16-063: MSIE 11 garbage collector attribute type confusion
============================================================================
This information is available in an easier to read format on my blog at
<http://blog.skylined.nl/>

With [MS16-063] Microsoft has patched [CVE-2016-0199]: a memory
corruption bug
in the garbage collector of the JavaScript engine used in Internet
Explorer 11.
By exploiting this vulnerability, a website can causes this garbage
collector
to handle some data in memory as if it was an object, when in fact it
contains
data for another type of value, such as a string or number. The garbage
collector code will use this data as a virtual function table (vftable)
in order
to make a virtual function call. An attacker has enough control over
this data
to allow execution of arbitrary code.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
+ **Microsoft Internet Explorer 11** (all versions before the June 2016
patch)

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  webpage. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from
triggering the
  vulnerable code path.

Repro
-----
I've created two separate html files that can be used to reproduce this
issue
and shows control over a 32-bit vftable pointer in x86 versions of MSIE or a
partial control over a 64-bit vftable pointer in x64 versions.

````HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=7">
<zcript>
  oElement = document.createElement("IMG");
  var oAttr = document.createAttribute("loop");
  oAttr.nodeValue = oElement;
  oElement.loop = 0x41424344; // Set original value data to 44 43 42 41
  oElement.setAttributeNode(oAttr); // Replace oElement with original
value data
  oElement.removeAttributeNode(oAttr);
  CollectGarbage(); // Use original value data as address 0x41424344 of
a vftable
</zcript>
````
(I've had to use xcript rather than script because Gmail refused to send it
otherwise, see <https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6590> for the reason.)

Description
-----------
When `setAttributeNode` is used to set an attribute of a HTML element,
and the
`Attr` node's `nodeValue` is not a valid value, this `nodeValue` is set
to the
value the attribute had before the call. This can happen for instance
when you
try to set an attribute that must have a string or number value by using an
`Attr` node with a HTML element as its `nodeValue` (as this is not a
string or
number). The HTML element in `nodeValue` is replaced with the string or
number
value the attribute had before the call to `setAttributeNode`.

If the `Attr` node is then removed using `removeAttributeNode` and the
garbage
collector runs, the code appears to assume the nodeValue still contains an
object, rather than the string or number it has been changed into. This
causes
the code to use the data for the string or number value as if it was a C++
object. It attempts to determine a function pointer for a method from the
object's virtual function table before calling this function using the
pointer.

If the previous value is a string, the character data from the string is
used
to calculate the function pointer. If the previous value is a number,
the value
of the number is used. This provides an attacker with a large amount of
control
over the function pointer and may allow execution of arbitrary code.

Scanner
-------
I build a "scanner" to analyze this issue and help create two
proof-of-concept
files that show control over the vftable pointer. More details and the
source
for these can be found on my blog at <http://blog.skylined.nl>.

Cheers,

SkyLined

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

CVE-2016-0199 / MS16-063: MSIE 11 garbage collector attribute type confusion
============================================================================
This information is available in an easier to read format on my blog at
http://blog.skylined.nl/

With [MS16-063] Microsoft has patched [CVE-2016-0199]: a memory
corruption bug
in the garbage collector of the JavaScript engine used in Internet
Explorer 11.
By exploiting this vulnerability, a website can causes this garbage
collector
to handle some data in memory as if it was an object, when in fact it
contains
data for another type of value, such as a string or number. The garbage
collector code will use this data as a virtual function table (vftable)
in order
to make a virtual function call. An attacker has enough control over
this data
to allow execution of arbitrary code.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
+ **Microsoft Internet Explorer 11** (all versions before the June 2016
patch)

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  webpage. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from
triggering the
  vulnerable code path.

Repro
-----
I've created two separate html files that can be used to reproduce this
issue
and shows control over a 32-bit vftable pointer in x86 versions of MSIE or a
partial control over a 64-bit vftable pointer in x64 versions.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=7">
<script>
  oElement = document.createElement("IMG");
  var oAttr = document.createAttribute("loop");
  oAttr.nodeValue = oElement;
  oElement.loop = 0x41424344; // Set original value data to 44 43 42 41
  oElement.setAttributeNode(oAttr); // Replace oElement with original value data
  oElement.removeAttributeNode(oAttr);
  CollectGarbage(); // Use original value data as address 0x41424344 of a vftable
</script>

<!--
(I've had to use xcript rather than script because Gmail refused to send it
otherwise, see https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6590 for the reason.)

Description
-----------
When `setAttributeNode` is used to set an attribute of a HTML element,
and the
`Attr` node's `nodeValue` is not a valid value, this `nodeValue` is set
to the
value the attribute had before the call. This can happen for instance
when you
try to set an attribute that must have a string or number value by using an
`Attr` node with a HTML element as its `nodeValue` (as this is not a
string or
number). The HTML element in `nodeValue` is replaced with the string or
number
value the attribute had before the call to `setAttributeNode`.

If the `Attr` node is then removed using `removeAttributeNode` and the
garbage
collector runs, the code appears to assume the nodeValue still contains an
object, rather than the string or number it has been changed into. This
causes
the code to use the data for the string or number value as if it was a C++
object. It attempts to determine a function pointer for a method from the
object's virtual function table before calling this function using the
pointer.

If the previous value is a string, the character data from the string is
used
to calculate the function pointer. If the previous value is a number,
the value
of the number is used. This provides an attacker with a large amount of
control
over the function pointer and may allow execution of arbitrary code.

Scanner
-------
I build a "scanner" to analyze this issue and help create two
proof-of-concept
files that show control over the vftable pointer. More details and the
source
for these can be found on my blog at http://blog.skylined.nl.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3163649)

Published: June 14, 2016 | Updated: June 22, 2016

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory
* Modifying how the JScript and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory
* Fixing how the Internet Explorer XSS Filter validates JavaScript
* Correcting how Windows handles proxy discovery

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0199](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0199) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0200](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0200) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-3211](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-3211) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the JScript 9, JScript, and VBScript engines render when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the JScript 9, JScript, and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

    ```

  **Impact of Workaround.** Websites that use VBScript or JScript may not work properly.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
        cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
        cacls %windir%\system32\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
        cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
        cacls %windir%\syswow64\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```

## Internet Explorer XSS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2016-3212

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Internet Explorer XSS Filter does not properly validate JavaScript under specific conditions. An attacker who exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code with medium-integrity level privileges (the permissions of the current user).

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.

However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site. The update addresses the vulnerability by fixing how the Internet Explorer XSS Filter validates JavaScript.
