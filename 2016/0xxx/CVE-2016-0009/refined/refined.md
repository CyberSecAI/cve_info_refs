Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Windows handles objects in memory within the kernel-mode driver `win32k.sys`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory management in the Windows kernel-mode driver
- Remote code execution vulnerability in the `win32k.sys` component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user, which can include administrative privileges if the user has them.
- An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to visit a malicious website.
- The malicious website would be designed to exploit the memory handling vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or control a website that contains the exploit.
- The attacker must convince a user to visit this malicious website. This could be done via social engineering tactics like malicious links in emails or IM messages.
- The attacker has to leverage the vulnerability via user interaction in the context of the logged-on user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin release.
- Microsoft was not aware of any active exploits at the time of the security bulletin's release.
- The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for older systems and **Important** for newer Windows systems
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Windows handles objects in memory within `win32k.sys`.
