  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-0194",
      "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly handle file access permissions, which could allow an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the user's computer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed. Note that the vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate a user’s rights directly, but the vulnerability could be used to obtain information in an attempt to further compromise the affected system.",
      "affected_components": [
        "Internet Explorer Add-on Installer"
      ],
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of file access permissions by Internet Explorer.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially read data from arbitrary files on the user's system due to improper validation of file access permissions."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the user's computer, potentially reading sensitive data not intended to be disclosed. This information could be used to further compromise the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Compromised websites",
        "Websites that accept or host user-provided content"
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to interact with specially crafted content, such as clicking a link that leads to the attacker’s site. The attacker cannot force the user to view the malicious content. They require the user to take action, like clicking a link.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists within the Internet Explorer Add-on Installer component.  An attacker can use this component to read the contents of any file that the current user has access to.  The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that file access permissions are properly validated before returning file data to the user."
