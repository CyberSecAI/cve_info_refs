- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When application tracing is enabled in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Client, the TSM password is included in plain text within the trace output during password change operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Plain text storage of sensitive information (password) in trace files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of the Tivoli Storage Manager password.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system where the client is installed, with application tracing enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the trace files generated by the Tivoli Storage Manager client when application tracing is enabled, and a password change operation has been performed.
