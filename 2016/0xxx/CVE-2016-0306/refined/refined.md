- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper TLS configuration when FIPS 140-2 is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from a weak TLS configuration, potentially making the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack via man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable server.
