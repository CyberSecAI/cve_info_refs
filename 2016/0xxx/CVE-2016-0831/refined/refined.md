Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Telephony component. Specifically, it's related to how permissions are checked when accessing device IDs via the `getDeviceId()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The primary weakness is that the Telephony component does not properly check permissions before allowing access to sensitive device identification information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An application can gain unauthorized access to sensitive device information, such as the device ID. This information can be used to track users, correlate their activities across different services or de-anonymize user activities and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** A malicious application, installed on the Android device, could exploit this vulnerability.
- The application would need to call the vulnerable function to gain access to the device ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the victim's device. The application does not need to be a system application, or have any special permissions beyond the normal ones granted to installable apps, which is the critical vulnerability of insufficient access controls
- **No Remote Access Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally, not remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity, meaning the impact isn't as severe as remote code execution or kernel compromise but is still critical because of the privacy implications
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding proper permission checks to the `getDeviceId()` function within the Telephony component to ensure only applications with the proper permissions can access device IDs.
- The vulnerability was reported on November 16, 2015.
