  "CVE-2016-0758": {
    "Description": "Integer overflow in lib/asn1_decoder.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.3 allows local users to bypass intended AF_UNIX socket permissions or cause a denial of service (panic) via crafted epoll_ctl calls.",
    "Root cause": "The ASN.1 decoder doesn't validate the length field of an ASN.1 value against the remaining amount of data before adding to the cursor. This could lead to an integer overflow which fails datalen - dp < 2 check. Also, maximum size of extended length is not checked for exceeding capacity.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Lack of validation for data length",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can gain privileges, cause memory corruption, or cause a denial of service(panic). It can also bypass the intended AF_UNIX socket permissions or cause a denial of service (panic) via crafted epoll_ctl calls.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation using crafted ASN.1 data, crafted mmap calls, crafted keyctl requests, crafted epoll_ctl calls, etc."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Local access to the machine is required. Crafting specific data is necessary for exploitation"
  },
  "CVE-2016-3672": {
    "Description": "The arch_pick_mmap_layout function in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 does not properly randomize the legacy base address, which makes it easier for local users to defeat the intended restrictions on the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE flag, and bypass the ASLR protection mechanism for a setuid or setgid program, by disabling stack-consumption resource limits.",
     "Root cause": "The Linux kernel does not randomize the legacy base address effectively, which is used in setuid or setgid programs, when the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE flag is used.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)"
    ],
     "Impact": "Local users can bypass the ASLR protection mechanism for setuid or setgid programs by disabling stack-consumption resource limits. Can potentially lead to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation using crafted mmap calls."
    ],
        "Required capabilities": "Requires local access to system. Attack complexity is low for the national vulnerability database (NVD) and medium for SUSE."
  },
  "CVE-2016-2187": {
    "Description": "The gtco_probe function in drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB device descriptor.",
    "Root cause": "The Linux kernel does not correctly handle a crafted endpoints value in a USB device descriptor in the gtco\_probe function, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Physically proximate attackers can cause a denial of service (system crash)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physically proximate attackers inserting a crafted USB device descriptor."
    ],
        "Required capabilities": "Requires physical proximity to the device and the ability to insert a crafted USB device."
  },
    "CVE-2015-7833": {
    "Description": "The usbvision driver in the Linux kernel package 3.10.0-123.20.1.el7 through 3.10.0-229.14.1.el7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a nonzero bInterfaceNumber value in a USB device descriptor.",
    "Root cause": "The usbvision driver doesn't correctly handle non zero bInterfaceNumber values in USB device descriptors, leading to a panic.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Physically proximate attackers can cause a denial of service (panic)",
