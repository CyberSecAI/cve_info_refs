Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-0729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper handling of malformed XML input documents by the Apache Xerces-C XML Parser library. Specifically, buffer overflows occur during processing and error reporting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple buffer overflows exist in:
    *   `internal/XMLReader.cpp`
    *   `util/XMLURL.cpp`
    *   `util/XMLUri.cpp`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, causing applications using the library to crash due to segmentation faults or memory corruption.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The vulnerability *could potentially* lead to arbitrary code execution, though this is mentioned as a possibility and is not the primary or certain impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network accessible.
*   The attacker needs to provide a malformed XML document as input to the vulnerable application using the Xerces-C library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need authentication.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed XML document to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Xerces-C version 3.1.3.
*   The overflows can manifest as segmentation faults or memory corruption during parsing operations.
*   The issue is related to how the parser handles specific types of malformed input.
*   The patches involve fixes in the `XMLReader.cpp`, `XMLURL.cpp`, and `XMLUri.cpp` files.
