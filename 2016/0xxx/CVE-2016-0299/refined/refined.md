- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the IBM TRIRIGA platform's failure to properly handle crafted web service requests. An unauthenticated SOAP request can be used to query the IBM TRIRIGA platform database and potentially expose sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure due to an unauthenticated SOAP request. The system doesn't properly validate or restrict access to data via SOAP requests, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the IBM TRIRIGA platform database.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a crafted web service request using HTTP/SOAP. This suggests a network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication. The attacker must be able to send crafted web service requests to the IBM TRIRIGA platform. It is suggested that network access to the IBM TRIRIGA platform is required, this may be external/Internet access.
