Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-0769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The eShop WordPress plugin (version 6.3.14) contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:**  Specifically, the `$delid` variable in the `deleteorder` function (used when deleting orders) is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code when deleting an order, which is executed in the context of an admin user. The vulnerability exists in lines 287-294 and 393-394 of `eshop-orders.php`.
- **SQL Injection:** The `$view` variable in the same file is vulnerable when viewing orders. This is a blind SQL Injection that requires an authenticated user. The vulnerability exists in lines 354-356 of `eshop-orders.php`.
- **SQL Injection:** The `mark` and `checkid` POST parameters used when changing order statuses are not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code into the `UPDATE` queries. The vulnerability exists in lines 421-427 and 429-434 of `eshop-orders.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:**  Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the WordPress database. This includes sensitive customer information, order details, or potentially user credentials.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While the blind SQL injection within the delete order function is admin only, other SQL Injection vulnerabilities may be exploitable by other users within the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameters:** The SQL injection vulnerability in the `deleteorder` function is triggered through the `delid` GET parameter when deleting orders. The SQL injection when viewing order is triggered via the `view` GET parameter.
- **HTTP POST Parameters:** The SQL injection vulnerability when changing an order status is triggered through the `mark`, `checkid` and `move` POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin User for Blind SQL injection:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability in the delete order function requires the attacker to be logged in as an administrator.
- **Authenticated User:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability in the view order function requires a regular logged-in user.
- **Authenticated User:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability in the order status update requires a logged-in user.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also mentions reflected XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-0765) in the same plugin due to lack of sanitization in the `page` and `action` GET parameters, but this is not relevant to CVE-2016-0769.
- This advisory provides the line numbers where the vulnerabilites exist, which is more detail than a typical CVE description.
- The provided content indicates that the eShop plugin is no longer available for download.
