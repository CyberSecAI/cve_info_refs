| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963330#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:26:02 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Nested attributes rejection proc bypass in Active Record.  There is a vulnerability in how the nested attributes feature in Active Record handles updates in combination with destroy flags when destroying records is disabled. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7577.  Versions Affected:  3.1.0 and newer Not affected:       3.0.x and older Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due to a change in the commit [a9b4b5d][1] the `_destroy` flag prevents the `:reject_if` proc from being called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway.  However this isn't true if `:allow_destroy` is false so this leads to changes that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could use this do things like set attributes to invalid values and to clear all of the attributes amongst other things. The severity will be dependent on how the application has used this feature.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/nested_attributes_bypass_fix.rb module ActiveRecord   module NestedAttributes     private      def reject_new_record?(association_name, attributes)       will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes) || call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)     end      def call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)       return false if will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)        case callback = self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:reject_if]       when Symbol         method(callback).arity == 0 ? send(callback) : send(callback, attributes)       when Proc         callback.call(attributes)       end     end      def will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes)       allow_destroy?(association_name) && has_destroy_flag?(attributes)     end      def allow_destroy?(association_name)       self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:allow_destroy]     end   end end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 3.2 series * 4-1-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits ------- Thank you to Justin Coyne for reporting the problem and working with us to fix it.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-7576 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7576)

#### Description

The http\_basic\_authenticate\_with method in actionpack/lib/action\_controller/metal/http\_authentication.rb in the Basic Authentication implementation in Action Controller in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not use a constant-time algorithm for verifying credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by measuring timing differences.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:18:38 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Timing attack vulnerability in basic authentication in Action Controller.  There is a timing attack vulnerability in the basic authentication support in Action Controller. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7576.  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ Due to the way that Action Controller compares user names and passwords in basic authentication authorization code, it is possible for an attacker to analyze the time taken by a response and intuit the password.  For example, this string comparison:    "foo" == "bar"  is possibly faster than this comparison:    "foo" == "fo1"  Attackers can use this information to attempt to guess the username and password used in the basic authentication system.  You can tell you application is vulnerable to this attack by looking for `http_basic_authenticate_with` method calls in your application.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/basic_auth_fix.rb module ActiveSupport   module SecurityUtils     def secure_compare(a, b)       return false unless a.bytesize == b.bytesize        l = a.unpack "C#{a.bytesize}"        res = 0       b.each_byte { |byte| res |= byte ^ l.shift }       res == 0     end     module_function :secure_compare      def variable_size_secure_compare(a, b)       secure_compare(::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(a), ::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(b))     end     module_function :variable_size_secure_compare   end end  module ActionController   class Base     def self.http_basic_authenticate_with(options = {})       before_action(options.except(:name, :password, :realm)) do         authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic(options[:realm] || "Application") do |name, password|           # This comparison uses & so that it doesn't short circuit and           # uses `variable_size_secure_compare` so that length information           # isn't leaked.           ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(name, options[:name]) &             ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(password, options[:password])         end       end     end   end end ```   Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 4-1-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits -------  Thank you to Daniel Waterworth for reporting the problem and working with us to fix it. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:19:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662977](attachment.cgi?id=662977&action=diff "5-0-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662977&action=edit "5-0-basic_auth.patch") 5-0-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:19:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662978](attachment.cgi?id=662978&action=diff "4-2-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662978&action=edit "4-2-basic_auth.patch") 4-2-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:20:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662979](attachment.cgi?id=662979&action=diff "4-1-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662979&action=edit "4-1-basic_auth.patch") 4-1-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:20:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662980](attachment.cgi?id=662980&action=diff "3-2-basic_auth.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662980&action=edit "3-2-basic_auth.patch") 3-2-basic_auth.patch ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-23 23:00:50 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c10)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-26 07:21:30 UTC  ``` public at <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/201> ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=963329#c13)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-26 12:56:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 663243](attachment.cgi?id=663243 "an example rails application with authentication") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=663243&action=edit "an example rails application with authentication") an example rails application with authentication  I don't know how to test this fix.

Subject: [CVE-2016-0751] Possible Object Leak and Denial of Service attack in
 Action Pack

Possible Object Leak and Denial of Service attack in Action Pack

There is a possible object leak which can lead to a denial of service
vulnerability in Action Pack. This vulnerability has been
assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2016-0751.

Versions Affected:  All.
Not affected:       None.
Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1

Impact
------
A carefully crafted accept header can cause a global cache of mime types to
grow indefinitely which can lead to a possible denial of service attack in
Action Pack.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
This attack can be mitigated by a proxy that only allows known mime types in
the Accept header.

Placing the following code in an initializer will also mitigate the issue:

```ruby
require 'action_dispatch/http/mime_type'

Mime.const_set :LOOKUP, Hash.new { |h,k|
  Mime::Type.new(k) unless k.blank?
}
```

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 5-0-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0 series
* 4-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series
* 4-1-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 4.1 series
* 3-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series

Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users
of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we
cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported
releases.

## Topic

Updated rh-ror41-rubygem-actionpack, rh-ror41-rubygem-actionview,
rh-ror41-rubygem-activemodel, and rh-ror41-rubygem-activerecord packages
that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat Software
Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rh-ror41 collection provides Ruby on Rails version 4.1. Ruby on Rails
is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.

The following issue was corrected in rubygem-actionpack and
rubygem-actionview:

A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Action View component
searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted
input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use
this to render unexpected files and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2016-0752)

The following issues were corrected in rubygem-actionpack:

A flaw was found in the way the Action Pack component performed MIME type
lookups. Since queries were cached in a global cache of MIME types, an
attacker could use this flaw to grow the cache indefinitely, potentially
resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0751)

A flaw was found in the Action Pack component's caching of controller
references. An attacker could use this flaw to cause unbounded memory
growth, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7581)

A flaw was found in the way the Action Controller component compared user
names and passwords when performing HTTP basic authentication. Time taken
to compare strings could differ depending on input, possibly allowing a
remote attacker to determine valid user names and passwords using a timing
attack. (CVE-2015-7576)

The following issue was corrected in rubygem-activerecord:

A flaw was found in the Active Record component's handling of nested
attributes in combination with the destroy flag. An attacker could possibly
use this flaw to set attributes to invalid values or clear all attributes.
(CVE-2015-7577)

The following issue was corrected in rubygem-activemodel and
rubygem-activerecord:

A flaw was found in the way the Active Model based models processed
attributes. An attacker with the ability to pass arbitrary attributes to
models could possibly use this flaw to bypass input validation.
(CVE-2016-0753)

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges John Poulin as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-0752, Aaron Patterson of Red Hat as the original reporter of
CVE-2016-0751, Daniel Waterworth as the original reporter of CVE-2015-7576,
Justin Coyne as the original reporter of CVE-2015-7577, and John Backus
from BlockScore as the original reporter of CVE-2016-0753.

All rh-ror41 collection rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-actionview,
rubygem-activemodel, and rubygem-activerecord packages users are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to
correct these issues. All running applications using the rh-ror41
collection must be restarted for this update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963331#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:35:50 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Possible Object Leak and Denial of Service attack in Action Pack  There is a possible object leak which can lead to a denial of service vulnerability in Action Pack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2016-0751.  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ A carefully crafted accept header can cause a global cache of mime types to grow indefinitely which can lead to a possible denial of service attack in Action Pack.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- This attack can be mitigated by a proxy that only allows known mime types in the Accept header.  Placing the following code in an initializer will also mitigate the issue:  ```ruby require 'action_dispatch/http/mime_type'  Mime.const_set :LOOKUP, Hash.new { |h,k|   Mime::Type.new(k) unless k.blank? } ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 5-0-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0 series * 4-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 4-1-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 3-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1301957#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-26 12:45:58 UTC  ``` There was reported a vulnerability in how the nested attributes feature in Active Record handles updates in combination with destroy flags when destroying records is disabled. When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due to a change in the commit [a9b4b5d][1] the `_destroy` flag prevents the `:reject_if` proc from being called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway. However if `:allow_destroy` is false this leads to changes that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could use this do things like set attributes to invalid values and to clear all of the attributes amongst other things. The severity will be dependent on how the application has used this feature.  Versions affected are 3.1.0 and newer.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:42:25 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via distros CRD: 2016-01-25  Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in Action View  There is a possible directory traversal and information leak vulnerability in Action View. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2016-0752.  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None. Fixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1  Impact ------ Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.  Impacted code will look something like this:  ```ruby def index   render params[:id] end ```  Carefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from unexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and can possibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- A workaround to this issue is to not pass arbitrary user input to the `render` method.  Instead, verify that data before passing it to the `render` method.  For example, change this:  ```ruby def index   render params[:id] end ```  To this:  ```ruby def index   render verify_template(params[:id]) end  private def verify_template(name)   # add verification logic particular to your application here end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series * 4-1-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.1 series * 4-2-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series * 5-0-render_data_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0 series  Please note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits ------- Thanks John Poulin for reporting this! ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:43:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662989](attachment.cgi?id=662989&action=diff "5-0-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662989&action=edit "5-0-render_data_leak.patch") 5-0-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:43:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662990](attachment.cgi?id=662990&action=diff "4-2-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662990&action=edit "4-2-render_data_leak.patch") 4-2-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:43:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662991](attachment.cgi?id=662991&action=diff "4-1-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662991&action=edit "4-1-render_data_leak.patch") 4-1-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-23 21:44:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662992](attachment.cgi?id=662992&action=diff "3-2-render_data_leak.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=662992&action=edit "3-2-render_data_leak.patch") 3-2-render_data_leak.patch ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-23 23:01:18 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-26 07:26:42 UTC  ``` public at <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/206> ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c9)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-26 16:31:08 UTC  ``` Portus and studio issues:  963607 963608 ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c13)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-27 09:58:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 663371](attachment.cgi?id=663371&action=diff "updated patch for 3.2 version") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=663371&action=edit "updated patch for 3.2 version") updated patch for 3.2 version  adapt the patch for 3.2 version to ruby 1.8 syntax.  <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/7f71b4d8a4744e26fcec7be13efb243e73ffd3ce>  Also I had to update the line numbers in the patch. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c15)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 16:00:29 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963332) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356307> 42.1 / rubygem-actionpack-4_2 ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c16)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 17:00:37 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963332) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356315> 13.2 / rubygem-actionpack-3_2 ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c17)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 18:00:32 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963332) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356334> 42.1 / rubygem-actionview-4_2 ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=963332#c18)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-28 09:06:44 UTC  ``` All submissions done.
