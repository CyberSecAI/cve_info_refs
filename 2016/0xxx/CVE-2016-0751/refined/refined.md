    "description": "actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/mime_type.rb in Action Pack in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not properly restrict use of the MIME type cache, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted HTTP Accept header.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper restriction of the MIME type cache in Action Pack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unrestricted use of the MIME type cache",
        "Global cache growth without limits."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service due to excessive memory consumption.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted HTTP Accept header"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests with a malicious Accept header to the vulnerable application. No authentication required.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is due to the way Action Pack caches mime types. A carefully crafted accept header can cause the global cache to grow indefinitely leading to a denial of service. The `Mime.const_set :LOOKUP, Hash.new { |h,k| Mime::Type.new(k) unless k.blank? }` monkey-patch was given as a workaround. A proxy that filters the accept header and allows only known mime types could mitigate the attack."
