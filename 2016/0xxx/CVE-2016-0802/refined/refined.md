  "CVE-2016-0802": {
    "description": "Multiple remote execution vulnerabilities in the Broadcom Wi-Fi driver could allow a remote attacker to use specially crafted wireless control message packets to corrupt kernel memory in a way that leads to remote code execution in the context of the kernel. These vulnerabilities can be triggered when the attacker and the victim are associated with the same network.",
    "root_cause": "A frame validation and memory corruption issue existed for a given ethertype.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption",
       "Insufficient frame validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution in the context of the kernel, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vector": "Specially crafted wireless control message packets over Wi-Fi",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim."
