[Nexus documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705)
for instructions on how to check the security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on January 4,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have been
released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability in Broadcom’s Wi-Fi driver is also Critical severity as
it could allow remote code execution on an affected device while connected to
the same network as the attacker. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the [Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.

### Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and
service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.* The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
    SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
    installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
    users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
    enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
    Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
    applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
    application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
    attempt to remove any such applications.* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
      pass media to processes such as mediaserver.
