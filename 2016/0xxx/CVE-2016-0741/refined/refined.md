{
  "CVE-2016-0741": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 389 Directory Server failed to correctly handle unexpectedly closed client connections, leading to an infinite loop in the server's worker threads.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An infinite loop vulnerability was present in the 389 directory server due to incorrect handling of closed client connections. The server's worker threads continued to try reading data on connections marked as closed.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by making the directory server consume excessive CPU and stop accepting new connections.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker able to connect to the server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable LDAP server."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "When a connection is abruptly closed due to an error, and there is still some data left to be read (buffer offset vs buffer bytes), `connection_threadmain` starts to loop.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The connection is marked as closed, which prevents the buffer bytes/offset to be updated. The worker thread endlessly tries to read the \"data\" over and over. The worker thread also repeatedly takes the factory extension lock which creates a lot of contention with the other worker threads.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "All the worker threads are trying to read data on closed connections, and the server stops accepting new connections, leading to Denial of Service.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker could close connections abruptly, while leaving data to be read.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the vulnerable LDAP server and close it in an unexpected way"
