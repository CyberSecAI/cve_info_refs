Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0707:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-0707

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from overly permissive file system permissions on the Ambari agent's working directories, specifically `/var/lib/ambari-agent/data` and `/var/lib/ambari-agent/keys`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The Ambari agent's working folders did not have restricted Access Control Lists (ACLs). This means that log files and other data within these folders could be accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Command log files within these directories might contain sensitive information, such as credentials or configuration details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the agent's working folders, including command logs.
- This could lead to further security breaches or unauthorized actions based on the exposed data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to the affected file system on the Ambari agent host.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the host where the Ambari agent is running. This could be via local access or through other vulnerabilities.
- The attacker needs to have privileges to read the affected directories, which is possible due to the weak ACL configuration.

**More Details than CVE:**
- The provided content includes the specific directories affected `/var/lib/ambari-agent/data` and `/var/lib/ambari-agent/keys`. It also provides specific mitigation steps including `chmod` commands to fix the permissions.
- The content also details the recommendation of upgrading to version 2.1.2 or above, as well as post upgrade steps to manually correct the ACLs of the existing folders.
- It highlights that command log files may contain sensitive information, which adds context to the risk of this vulnerability.
