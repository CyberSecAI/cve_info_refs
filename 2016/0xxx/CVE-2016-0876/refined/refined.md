**Root cause of vulnerability:** The configuration files of the Moxa EDR-G903 secure routers store passwords in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext storage of passwords

**Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information, such as user credentials, potentially leading to further compromise of the device or network.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, where the attacker accesses configuration files containing plaintext passwords through network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only requires network access to the device to access the configuration files, with no prior privileges or user interaction required.
