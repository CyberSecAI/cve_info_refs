The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Center opens a specially crafted Media Center link (.mcl) file that references malicious code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nThis security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Media Center when installed on Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8.1. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.\n\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Center handles certain resources in the .mcl file. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.\n\nFor more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3150220](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3150220).\n\n## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings\n\nThe following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).\n\nThe severity ratings indicated for each affected software assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletin's release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the [May bulletin summary](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms16-may).\n\n| **Operating System** | **Component** | [**Windows Media Center Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0185**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0185) | **Updates Replaced** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Windows Vista** |  |  |  |\n| Windows Vista Service Pack 2 | [Windows Media Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8206f431-c2f4-4c4b-971c-f185a5f88673) (3150220) | **Important** Remote Code Execution | 3108669 in [MS15-134](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=699419) |\n| Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2 | [Windows Media Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=b939f8c1-b282-4534-a833-2e77fb08378e) (3150220) | **Important** Remote Code Execution | 3108669 in [MS15-134](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=699419) |\n| **Windows 7** |  |  |  |\n| Windows 7 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 1 | [Windows Media Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=a8927a54-1bd8-4e7f-9811-aa43be7be4f2) (3150220) | **Important** Remote Code Execution | 3108669 in [MS15-134](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=699419) |\n| Windows 7 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1 | [Windows Media Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e52f373e-369d-4347-b304-1dfd74c86749) (3150220) | **Important** Remote Code Execution | 3108669 in [MS15-134](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=699419) |\n| **Windows 8.1** |  |  |  |\n| Windows 8.1 for 32-bit Systems | [Windows Media Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d8e79aa9-b405-4a18-a101-806049ca6cbe) (3150220) | **Important** Remote Code Execution | 3108669 in [MS15-134](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=699419) |\n| Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems | [Windows Media Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=18cdf435-a1f5-4d5d-9e63-f2de7d910d85) (3150220) | **Important** Remote Code Execution | 3108669 in [MS15-134](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=699419) |\n\n## Vulnerability Information\n\n## Windows Media Center Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0185\n\nA vulnerability exists in Windows Media Center that could allow remote code execution if Windows Media Center opens a specially crafted Media Center link (.mcl) file that references malicious code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of an affected system. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Workstations are primarily at risk of this vulnerability.\n\nTo exploit the vulnerability, user interaction is required. In a web-browsing scenario, a user would have to navigate to a compromised website that an attacker is using to host a malicious .mcl file. In an email attack scenario, an attacker would have to convince a user who is logged on to a vulnerable workstation to click a specially crafted link in an email. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Center handles certain resources in the .mcl file.\n\nThe following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:\n\n| **Vulnerability Title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Windows Media Center Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0185) | No | No |\n\n### Mitigating Factors\n\nMicrosoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:\n\n**Remove the MCL file association**\n\n*   **To use the interactive method:**\n\n    **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the \"Changing Keys and Values\" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the \"Add and Delete Information in the Registry\" and \"Edit Registry Data\" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.\n\n    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.\n    2.  Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, click **.MCL**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.\n    3.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **MCL HKCR file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**.\n\n        This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.\n    4.  Press the **Delete** key to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.\n    5.  Expand **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER**, then **Software**, then **Microsoft**, then **Windows**, then **CurrentVersion**, then **Explorer**, and then **FileExts**.\n    6.  Click **.MCL**, and then click the **File** menu and select **Export**.\n    7.  In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type **MCL HKCU file association registry backup.reg** and click **Save**.\n\n        This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.\n    8.  Press the **Delete** key to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry value, click **Yes**.\n\n*   **To use the managed deployment script method:**\n    1.  Make a backup copy of the registry keys from a managed deployment script using the following commands:\n\n         `Regedit.exe /e MCL_HKCR_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.MCL Regedit.exe /e MCL_HKCU_registry_backup.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\FileExts\\.MCL`\n    2.  Save the following to a file with a .reg extension (for example, Delete\\_MCL\\_file\\_association.reg):\n\n         ```\n             Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n             [-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.MCL]\n             [-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\\n             FileExts\\.MCL]\n\n         ```\n    3.  Run the registry script that you created in **Step 2** on the target machine using the following command:\n\n         **Regedit.exe /s Delete\\_EXTENSION\\_file\\_association.reg**\n\n         **How to undo the workaround.**\n\n         1. Restore the registry key by using Regedit to restore the settings saved in the .REG file.\n\n## Security Update Deployment\n\nFor Security Update Deployment information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article referenced here in the Executive Summary.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
