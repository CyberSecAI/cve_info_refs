- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted SELECT statement with a subquery containing the AVG OLAP function on an Oracle compatible database can cause the DB2 server to terminate abnormally.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Denial of Service due to a flaw in processing specific SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The DB2 server terminates abnormally leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, authenticated DB2 user issues a specially crafted SELECT statement.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated DB2 user, with the ability to execute SQL statements.
