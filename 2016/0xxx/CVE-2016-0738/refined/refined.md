Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `SegmentedIterable` class within the OpenStack Swift proxy server. This class is used when handling downloads of Static Large Objects (SLOs) and Dynamic Large Objects (DLOs).
*   Specifically, when a client prematurely closes a connection during a large object download, the proxy server fails to close the underlying connection to the object server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Connection Leak:** The `SegmentedIterable` object's `app_iter` generator creates a cyclic reference and isn't properly closed, which prevents garbage collection and leads to a socket leak for the client-to-proxy connection (file descriptor leak).
*   This was caused by missing `.close()` calls in several locations within the code

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly initiating and interrupting large object downloads, an attacker can exhaust the proxy server's resources, leading to a denial of service. This resource exhaustion manifests as increased memory usage in the python process itself, and also exhausts kernel resources by not releasing socket buffers and file descriptors.
*   The issue impacts the stability of the affected systems by filling the TCP stack of the kernel, which prevents new and existing ssh connections to connect to the system (unresponsiveness).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated (Mostly):** While authentication is needed to access the Swift API, the vulnerability itself can be triggered without any specific credentials once an authenticated session is made.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Swift proxy server.
*   The attacker must be a valid authenticated user for the swift environment being targeted, or the object needs to be publically accessible.
*   The attacker must be able to perform a partial read by terminating connections during large object downloads (e.g., using `curl -m` to set a timeout or interrupting a download).

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `5ca49ca92485b6ba868544f12fa524d9d7b666c6`, which modified the `SegmentedIterable` class.
*   A patch was introduced by commit `12d8a53fffea6e4bed8ba3d502ce625f5c6710b9` to try and resolve issues related to this leak.
*   The fix was introduced by commit `58359269b0e971e52f0eb7f97221566ca2148014` which fixes the leak for client connections by implementing a `close()` method in `SegmentedIterable`. This commit also unwinds the generator's stack, making it eligible for garbage collection.
*   The issue is reproducible on versions of Swift before those with the fix applied, and also versions between 2.4.0 and 2.5.0.
*   The vulnerability affects SLOs and DLOs only, and not normal Swift objects.
*   The problem is related to how the proxy manages connections to object servers and not storage backends.
*   The issue does not seem to be tied to curl version, as it was reproducible using curl 7.43.0 in some situations. It appears the key is a socket that is closed without consuming the whole object.
