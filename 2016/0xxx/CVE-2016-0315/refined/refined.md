Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-0315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because the Session ID is not destroyed upon user logout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the failure to invalidate or destroy session identifiers after a user logs out, leaving the session vulnerable to hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can take over another user's session after they have logged out by using the still-active session ID. This could lead to unauthorized access to the victim's account, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, manipulating data, or performing actions as that user.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker needs to obtain a user's session ID after they have logged out. The precise method to achieve this isn't specified in the provided text, but it would likely involve intercepting or guessing the session ID somehow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system.
- They need to somehow obtain the session ID of another user after that user has logged out.
- No direct user interaction is required as a click hijacking is not part of this CVE.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the IBM Jazz Reporting Service.
- The vulnerability affects versions 5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, 6.0, and 6.0.1.
- The provided text includes CVSS v3 score of: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) which translates to:
    -   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network): The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    -   **AC:H** (Attack Complexity: High): The attack requires specialized access conditions or techniques.
    -   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low): The attacker needs only basic user privileges.
    -   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None): No user interaction is required for a successful attack.
    -   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged): The vulnerability's impact is limited to the vulnerable component.
    -   **C:L** (Confidentiality Impact: Low): There's limited impact on confidentiality.
    -   **I:L** (Integrity Impact: Low): There's limited impact on integrity.
    -   **A:L** (Availability Impact: Low): There's limited impact on availability.
