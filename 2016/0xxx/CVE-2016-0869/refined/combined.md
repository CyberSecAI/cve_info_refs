# MICROSYS PROMOTIC Memory Corruption Vulnerability

Last RevisedAugust 23, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-16-026-01

## OVERVIEW

Security researcher Praveen Darshanam of Versa Networks has identified a memory corruption vulnerability in the MICROSYS, spol. s r.o. PROMOTIC application. MICROSYS has produced a new version to mitigate this vulnerability. The researcher has tested the new version to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

MICROSYS reports that the vulnerability affects the following versions of PROMOTIC:

* PROMOTIC versions prior to version 8.3.11

## IMPACT

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability may be able to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

MICROSYS is a Czech-based company with headquarters in Ostrava.

The affected product, PROMOTIC, is a Microsoft Windows-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) human-machine interface (HMI) software programming suite for creating applications that monitor, control, and display technological processes. This suite also includes support for a web interface.

According to MICROSYS, PROMOTIC is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems. The PROMOTIC system is primarily used in the Czech and Slovak Republics. It is also used in Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOWCWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html, web site last accessed January 26, 2016.

This vulnerability is exploited when a valid user runs malicious HTML code. This may happen if they are tricked by a phishing attack or another social engineering method into visiting a malicious web site hosting this code.

CVE-2016-0869NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0869, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, web site last accessed January 26, 2016.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and cannot be exploited without user interaction. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads the malformed HTML file.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

#### DIFFICULTY

Crafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be simple. Social engineering is required to convince the user to accept the malformed HTML file. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.

## MITIGATION

MICROSYS recommends that users with affected versions of PROMOTIC update their installations by downloading the latest version and installation instructions from the following MICROSYS web site:

<http://www.promotic.eu/en/promotic/download/download.htm> (link is external).

MICROSYS has produced a news release that contains additional information about new features and bug fixes for available stable and developmental PROMOTIC software versions:

<http://www.promotic.eu/en/pmdoc/NewsPm803.htm#ver80311>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading\_room/emailscams\_0905.pdf, web site last accessed January 26, 2016. for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed January 26, 2016. for more information on social engineering attacks.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **Fixed bug:** Writing object or array into the variable was possible only when using the [PmRtProf](PriceList/PriceList.htm#PriceList_PmRtProf) licence. Now this works with all licences except [PmRtFree - Free runtime licence](PriceList/PmFree.htm#PmRtFree).
- **[PmgString](Objects/Pmg/PmgString/PmgString.htm)** object: Is now functional also for German localization setting of the Windows OS (where the number contains separator of thousands "period").

- **[PmMBus](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmMBus/PmMBus.htm)** communication driver: Improved receiving of some values (e.g. values with extended VIFE used for detecting variable change time).
- **[PmABradleyCIP](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmABradleyCIP/PmABradleyCIP.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** Was not possible to receive 2-dimensional array.
- **[PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm)** object: **Fixed bug:** If the application zoom was active then the width/height of individual frames were not evaluated correctly sometimes (see the "[PmaRoot > Appearance > Application appearance zoom](Objects/Pma/PmaRoot/Cfg/Appearance.htm#Cfg_Zoom)" configurator).
- **[INFO system](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm)**: **Fixed bug:** The content of the [PmaInstance](Objects/Pma/PmaInstance/PmaInstance.htm) object sometimes did not expand correctly.
## Version 8.3.9 (from 19.11.2015) - stable version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **Panel editor:** **Fixed bug:**
- It was not possible to move the [PmgLine](Objects/Pmg/PmgLine/PmgLine.htm) object if configured vertically or horizontally. The patch has also been included into the version [Pm8.2.23](NewsPm802.htm#ver80223).
- If Pmg objects were copied from the Windows clipboard then these Pmg objects were not marked.
- **[PmaAdo](Objects/Pma/PmaAdo/PmaAdo.htm)** object: new methods **for transactions support**: [DbBeginTrans](Objects/Pma/PmaAdo/PropMeth/DbBeginTrans.htm), [DbCommitTrans](Objects/Pma/PmaAdo/PropMeth/DbCommitTrans.htm) and [DbRollbackTrans](Objects/Pma/PmaAdo/PropMeth/DbRollbackTrans.htm).
- **[PmForm](Objects/PmForm/PmForm.htm)** object:
- New type of the Pmf object - separator, i.e. [PmfSepar](Objects/PmForm/PmfSepar/PmfSepar.htm) object.
- [Close](Objects/PmForm/PropMeth/Close.htm) new method and new properties [BgColor](Objects/PmForm/PropMeth/BgColor.htm), [SysButtons](Objects/PmForm/PropMeth/SysButtons.htm).
- **[PmaTrendGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaTrendGroup/PmaTrendGroup.htm)** object:
- The [GetValueByTime](Objects/Pma/PmaTrendGroup/PropMeth/GetValueByTime.htm) method was not able to return single value for [Database dBase backups](Objects/Pma/PmaTrendGroup/Cfg/Cfg/DlgPidBaseBackup.htm) saving type.
- If [Database Access backups (obsolete)](Objects/Pma/PmaTrendGroup/Cfg/Cfg/DlgPiAccessBackup.htm) saving type was used a new backup was created each time after the application is launched.
- **[PmS7](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmS7/PmS7.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** Variables from one [PmaCommGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaCommGroup/PmaCommGroup.htm) were sometimes incorrectly distributed among communication messages and then some variables were not transmitted. (bug since Pm8.3.2 version)
- **[PmTeco](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmTeco/PmTeco.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** If 8-byte values were trasmitted (data type [LREAL](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmTeco/PmTeco.htm#DT_LREAL) and [DATE / DATE\_AND\_TIME](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmTeco/PmTeco.htm#DT_DATE)) there were errors occuring.
- **[PmABradleyDF1](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmABradleyDF1/PmABradleyDF1.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** The communication did not work if there were variables demanding data from different DataFile numbers in one [PmaCommGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaCommGroup/PmaCommGroup.htm) object.
## Version 8.3.8 (from 1.10.2015) - stable version

Since this version, the Promotic8.3 is considered **stable**. Only necessary bugfixes and new features not affecting system stability will be added to this version.

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- Fixed input of localized real numbers (in [Development environment PROMOTIC](DtEnv/DtEnv.htm), Panel editor and in Pmg objects [PmgString](Objects/Pmg/PmgString/PmgString.htm), [PmgWEdit](Objects/Pmg/PmgWEdit/PmgWEdit.htm)) if the decimal separator was entered as "comma" and separator of thousands as "period" (German localized number input).
- **[PmForm](Objects/PmForm/PmForm.htm)** new object: Allows to create of forms for entering data. Opens by methods of the [OpenView](Directions/OpenView.htm) type i.e. it can be opened in a separate window, in the [PmgFrame](Objects/Pmg/PmgFrame/PmgFrame.htm) object, or in [PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm). It is functional also in [Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm). Replaces the obsolete [Pm.InputBox](Objects/Pm/PropMeth/InputBox.htm) method.
- **[PmFree](PriceList/PmFree.htm)**: Tighten conditions for **[PmFree - Free development environment and runtime licence of the PROMOTIC system](PriceList/PmFree.htm) applications**. Following limitations were added to runtime:
- Maximum number of 10 panels (of [PmaPanel](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PmaPanel.htm) objects) can be used.
- The Value of the Object type and of the Array type cannot be stored into variables of [PmaData](Objects/Pma/PmaData/PmaData.htm), [PmaDataTable](Objects/Pma/PmaDataTable/PmaDataTable.htm), [PmaCommGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaCommGroup/PmaCommGroup.htm), [PmaOpcDaClientGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaOpcDaClientGroup/PmaOpcDaClientGroup.htm) objects.
- **[PmgCanvas](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/PmgCanvas.htm)** object: New simple **drawing tool** has been created. This way it is possible to draw the canvas object and the editor then transforms it to script.

This tool will be developed further in future versions in order to provide more graphic functions and also to read and render canvas scripts.

The canvas drawing tool now can be opened from following locations:
- Select preconfiguration [/ Image / Drawing PmgCanvas graphics](Subsystems/PreCfg/PreCfgG/CanvasDrawImg.htm) or
- On the "[Draw](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/Cfg/Draw.htm)" tab - when creating new method select option "[draw PmgCanvas image](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/Cfg/Cfg/DlgCanvasMethod.htm#Cfg_ContentDrawCanvasImg)" or
- On the "[Draw](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/Cfg/Draw.htm)" tab - in the script editor context menu select [Canvas editor ...](DtEnv/ScriptEditor/ScriptEditorControl.htm#Cfg_CanvasDraw).
- **[PmList](Objects/Others/PmList/PmList.htm)** new object: Allows to create a LIFO and FIFO list of values in this object.
- **[PmIEC8705](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmIEC8705/PmIEC8705.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** After 32000 communications were completed, the system re-established the connection unnecessarily.
- **New preconfigurations:**
- Preconfiguration **[Bar (PmgBar)](Subsystems/PreCfg/PreCfgG/Gr_Bar.htm)**: Bar (PmgBar) by the [PmgCanvas](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/PmgCanvas.htm) object.
## Version 8.3.7 (from 27.8.2015) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **Fixed bug:** The version Pm8.3.6 did not work properly in Windows OS XP.
- **[How to create an application using different national languages](Subsystems/Languages/AppNatLang.htm)**: Added new supported runtime national languages: **Standard Mandarin** (zh) and **Bahasa Malaysia** (ms).
- **[PmgTrendViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/PmgTrendViewer.htm)** object: **Fixed bug:** in [Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm): sometimes did not render correctly in the Chrome Web browser.
- **[#pragma](DtEnv/ScriptEditor/Pragma.htm)**: **Fixed bug:** The [#pragma option OldGlobalMethodCall](DtEnv/ScriptEditor/Pragma.htm#Pragma_Option_OldGlobalMethodCall) script directive did not work in the script.
## Version 8.3.6 (from 14.8.2015) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- The PROMOTIC system has been tested on the released version of the Windows OS 10 and is confirmed to be fully functional.
- **[PmAction](Objects/Others/PmAction/PmAction.htm)** new object: Object represents an action that can be executed later.
- **[OpenView](Directions/OpenView.htm)** method: Highly generalized panel opening by using the [OpenView](Directions/OpenView.htm) methods:
- New (fourth) optional oExtra parameter added to the [OpenView](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PropMeth/OpenView.htm) methods. This parameter allows to set properties for opening:
- [oExtra.Arguments](Directions/OpenView.htm#Extra_Arguments) (object of the [PmMap](Objects/Others/PmMap/PmMap.htm) type): Value that is passed to the opening panel and will be available in the panel by means of the [PmgRoot.Arguments](Objects/Pmg/PmgRoot/PropMeth/Arguments.htm) property.
- [oExtra.onClose](Directions/OpenView.htm#Extra_onClose) (object of the [PmAction](Objects/Others/PmAction/PmAction.htm) type): It can be defined the designer method here that is called when this panel is being closed.
- This generalization **also changes the way the modal windows are created** - i.e. windows that block user access to other windows during data entry.

The [OpenViewModal](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PropMeth/OpenViewModal.htm) method is now considered obsolete - this method is "synchronous", i.e. when called the script waits until the window is closed and continues its function after that. This approach is not functional in many Web browsers and the concept itself from the script operation point of view is not correct.

New type of a modal window opening by the [OpenView](Directions/OpenView.htm) method (with defined entry [modal:1;](Objects/Others/PmViewCreator/PropMeth/Frame.htm#Opt_modal_1)) opens the window modaly but the script continues to run. Once the modal window is closed, designer method is called that was defined in the [oExtra.onClose](Directions/OpenView.htm#Extra_onClose) entry

See [How to work with modal windows](Directions/HowModalWnd.htm).
Modal windows that are open this way are functional fully in all Web browsers.
- **[Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm)**:
**New "[PmaPanel > Web server > Refresh error indication method](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/Cfg/WebServer.htm#Cfg_RefreshErrMode)" configurator:** Allows to supress displaying of error message in the panel informing about communication failure with the server.
The context menu ([onMenuFill](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/Event/onMenuFill.htm) and [onMenuSelect](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/Event/onMenuSelect.htm)) was redesigned in order to work correctly in all Web browsers.
- **[PmgObject.ShowMenu](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/PropMeth/ShowMenu.htm)** method: Opens context menu of the Pmg object
- **[PmgTrendViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/PmgTrendViewer.htm)** object: **Fixed bug:** in [Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm):
- Rendering when no trend was connected.
- Rendering when scrolling in the table mode.
- **[PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm)** object: For each frame there are new "[Minimum width (px)](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/Cfg/Frames.htm#Cfg_SizeMinWidth)" configurator and "[Minimum height (px)](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/Cfg/Frames.htm#Cfg_SizeMinHeight)" configurator.

It is important to set these configurators if it is needed to prevent reduction of frame size to zero value. This is necessary when displaying workspace on the Web using small screen (handheld) devices (Android smatphones ...) where the workspace is displayed in minimal size.
- **[PmS7](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmS7/PmS7.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** If connection is lost then the [Quality](Objects/Others/PmVar/PropMeth/Quality.htm) property is overwritten in all variables.
- **[Maatrix Web service: communication with mobile apps](Subsystems/Comm/Protocol/Maatrix/Maatrix.htm)**: New **communication with Web service [Maatrix](Subsystems/Comm/Protocol/Maatrix/Maatrix.htm)**. This service allows to send general messages from the PROMOTIC application to mobile devices.

There is a **new preconfiguration [Sending messages to Maatrix mobile application service](Subsystems/PreCfg/PreCfgA/Comm_Maatrix_01.htm)**.
- **New preconfigurations:**
- Preconfiguration **[Polar chart](Subsystems/PreCfg/PreCfgG/CanvasGraphPolar01.htm)**
- Preconfiguration **[Wind direction chart (compass-card)](Subsystems/PreCfg/PreCfgG/CanvasGraphWind01.htm)**
## Version 8.3.5 (from 14.5.2015) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **[PmaInstance](Objects/Pma/PmaInstance/PmaInstance.htm)** object: Optimization and faster loading from the [PmaPrototype](Objects/Pma/PmaPrototype/PmaPrototype.htm) object at application launch.
- **[Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm)**: **Fixed bug:** The size and position of the panel opened in a new window were not evaluated correctly (i.e. if "target:\_blank;").
- **[PmgTrendViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/PmgTrendViewer.htm)** object: **Fixed bug:** While configuring the object the panel editor sometimes failed (bug since Pm8.3.4 version).
- **[Data binding SP - Pm object property](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/DBinds/Cfg/DBindSP.htm)**: **Fixed bug:** did not work in JavaScript panels.
- **[PmIEC8705](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmIEC8705/PmIEC8705.htm)** communication driver: Generalization by types ASDU-5 and ASDU-6
- **[PmSNMP](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmSNMP/PmSNMP.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** It was not possible to receive variables of the Unsigned32 type (bug since Pm8.3.4 version).
- **New preconfigurations:**
- Preconfiguration **[Energy output progression chart](Subsystems/PreCfg/PreCfgG/CanvasGraphElPower01.htm)**
## Version 8.3.4 (from 22.4.2015) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- New type of file path entry: In previous versions the paths were defined by the [$.path](Directions/Macro/MacroPath.htm) macro expression. In usual cases this was unnecessarily complicated because the macro expression had always to be evaluated. Therefore it is recommended since this version to enter paths in new format starting with # character (see [PROMOTIC path to files or folders](Directions/PmFilePath.htm)). The [$.path](Directions/Macro/MacroPath.htm) macro expression is still functional but no longer needed for simple path entry.
- **[PmgCanvas](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/PmgCanvas.htm)** object:
- On the "[Draw](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/Cfg/Draw.htm)" tab it is now possible to create **auxiliary methods for drawing**. In the [onDraw](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/Cfg/Draw.htm#Event_onDraw) event it is no longer neede to write the whole drawing script, but auxiliary methods can be called. This way the drawing script becomes much simpler.
- **New [CanvasCtxExt](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/CanvasCtxExt/CanvasCtxExt.htm) object** for drawing. This object adds the functions of deformation rotation transformations. The object can be accessed via the [pEvent.CtxExt](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/Cfg/Draw.htm#Par_CtxExt) parameter.
- **[PmMap](Objects/Others/PmMap/PmMap.htm)** new object: Allows to create new user properties in this (empty at the beginning) object. This is very handy if the designer needs to transfer multiple named values into some method.
- **[PmgTrendViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/PmgTrendViewer.htm)** object: in JavaScript panels:
- New methods [AddPoints](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/tvPoints/PropMeth/AddPoints.htm), [GetTimeArray](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/tvPoints/PropMeth/GetTimeArray.htm) and [GetValueArray](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/tvPoints/PropMeth/GetValueArray.htm).
- Improved values rendering of trends by clicking the mouse.
- **[Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm)**: **Fixed bug:** Bugfixes that conflicted with the old InternetExplorer 8 browser.
- **[PmBACnet](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmBACnet/PmBACnet.htm)** communication driver: Receive and write of the weekly-schedule property in the [Schedule](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmBACnet/PmBACnet.htm#BnObj_Schedule) object is now working.
- **[PmSNMP](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmSNMP/PmSNMP.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** Bugfixes of problems with high volumes of data (sende nad receive).
## Version 8.3.3 (from 5.3.2015) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **[Pm.GetSystemInfo](Objects/Pm/PropMeth/GetSystemInfo.htm)** method: New option ["win.username"](Objects/Pm/PropMeth/GetSystemInfo.htm#Par_What.win.username) returns the name of currently logged-in user in Windows OS.
- **[PmaAlarmGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaAlarmGroup/PmaAlarmGroup.htm)** object:
- Bugfix when opening alarm/event viewer on the Web. If [$vb](Directions/Macro/MacroVb.htm) was used then in the alarm group identifier the expression was evaluated as empty.
- Bugfix of memory data overwrite on writing into DBF ([DBF alarms](Objects/Pma/PmaAlarmGroup/Cfg/Cfg/DlgStorageParamsFileDbf.htm)) if the written value size exceded the column size in DBF.
- Bugfix of application launch [with runtime licence](PriceList/LicMedia/LicMedia.htm) (bug since Pm8.3.2 version).
## Version 8.3.2 (from 2.3.2015) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **[PmFilesApp](Directions/PmFilesApp.htm)**: **New subfolders** will be created in the application folder:
- **[DtBackup](Directions/PmFilesApp.htm#Folder_DtBackup):** The [*Application*.pra](Directions/PmFilesApp.htm#File_AppPra) file backup is saved here. It is functional for **automatic saving** editing this file.
- **[Temp](Directions/PmFilesApp.htm#Folder_AppTemp):** Temporary files (for example created during import/export are saved here.
- **[ExtTrend](Objects/Others/PmVar/DExtn/ExtTrend/ExtTrend.htm)** Data extension: Generalization for possibility to trend just a selected bit in a value (see the "[Value type](Objects/Others/PmVar/DExtn/ExtTrend/Cfg/ExtCfg.htm#Cfg_ValType)" configurator).
- **[PmaAlarmGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaAlarmGroup/PmaAlarmGroup.htm)** object:
- The history data can now be saved also in **Database MySQL cyclic** and **Database FireBird cyclic** (see the "[Storage type](Objects/Pma/PmaAlarmGroup/Cfg/Storage.htm#Cfg_Type)" configurator).
- In the [Acknowledge](Objects/Pma/PmaAlarmGroup/PropMeth/Acknowledge.htm) method, now it is possible to enter the national language of acknowledging user.
- The texts localization for national languages has been improved in Web client.
- **[MS SQL Server Compact](Subsystems/Db/MsSQL/MsSqlCompact.htm)**: For the purpose of small and testing database applications this freeware version can be used in objects [PmaAdo](Objects/Pma/PmaAdo/PmaAdo.htm), [PmaAlarmGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaAlarmGroup/PmaAlarmGroup.htm) and [PmaTrendGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaTrendGroup/PmaTrendGroup.htm).
- **[Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm)**:
- Methods [Pm.CreateDate](Objects/Pm/PropMeth/CreateDate.htm) and [Pm.FormatDate](Objects/Pm/PropMeth/FormatDate.htm) are now functional.
- Editing is now available in Touchpad browsers that do not support mouse - for example Android. These browsers do not support left mouse button double-click that is used for editing in graphic objects [PmgString](Objects/Pmg/PmgString/PmgString.htm) and [PmgWTable](Objects/Pmg/PmgWTable/PmgWTable.htm). Now it is possible to edit the Pmg object content by opening the Pmg object context menu - i.e. for example in Android system, by long touch over the Pmg object.
- Edit mode in the [PmgWEdit](Objects/Pmg/PmgWEdit/PmgWEdit.htm) object fixed - did not work in Chrome and Android.
- **[PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm)** object: Now working for the Web as standard HTML page (old concept of frameset was used before). also the scrollbar function has been fixed on the Web.
- **[PmS7](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmS7/PmS7.htm)** communication driver:
- New configurators in the protocol parameters:
- [Max. PDU length](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmS7/PmS7.htm#ParProt_MaxPduLen): maximum message length limit
- [Connection type](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmS7/PmS7.htm#ParProt_ConnType): Connection type (specifies whether application connects to PLC as PG=Programming device or OP=Operator panel).
- Communication with **[LOGO!](Subsystems/Comm/PLC/LOGO/LOGO.htm) modules** version 8 has been tested. The modules support S7 protocol since this version so the S7 driver can be used.
- **[PmMBus](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmMBus/PmMBus.htm)** communication driver:
- Generalization in ItemId the desired Subunit now can be defined.
- New message type (in the [PmaCommMsg](Objects/Pma/PmaCommMsg/PmaCommMsg.htm) object) has been created for reading information about which values can be obtained from the meter.
- Sometimes the "recount to basic physics units" did not work correctly (for VIFE extended type)
- **[PmABradleyCIP](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmABradleyCIP/PmABradleyCIP.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** Sometimes the "[Reading names of all available variables from the PLC device](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmABradleyCIP/PmABradleyCIP.htm#Msg_ReadVars)" message type transmission did not work correctly.
- There is now a new **[Script wizard](DtEnv/ScriptEditor/ScriptWizard.htm)** in the script editor for simple entry of common statements (if, for, switch, panel opening, etc.)
- Graphic **ActiveX object Graph** (for displaying values in bars, 3D, etc.) is removed from PROMOTIC installation and documentation since this version. This object is considered obsolete and is replaced by the [PmgCanvas](Objects/Pmg/PmgCanvas/PmgCanvas.htm) object (see preconfigurations in the group [Preconfigurations in group "Trend"](Subsystems/PreCfg/PreCfgG/Gr_Trend.htm)). ActiveX object can be downloaded independently from <https://www.promotic.eu/en/>.
## Version 8.3.1 (from 5.11.2014) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **[How to create an application using different national languages](Subsystems/Languages/AppNatLang.htm)**: Added new supported runtime national languages: **Turkish** (tr).

- **Panel editor:** Bugfixes in configurators of Pmg objects. As the configurators were modified in the Pm8.3 version, some [data bindings](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/DBinds/GroupDBind.htm) or [macro expressions](Directions/Macro/Macro.htm) malfunctioned.
- **[PmgRasterImage](Objects/Pmg/PmgRasterImage/PmgRasterImage.htm)** object: **Fixed bug:** The transparency defined of the "[Opacity level](Objects/Pmg/PmgRasterImage/Cfg/Image.htm#Cfg_OpacityLevel)" configurator was sometimes rendered incorrectly.
- **[PmaPanel](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PmaPanel.htm)** object: **Fixed bug:** JavaScript panels sometimes caused memory shortages.
- **[Web panels](Subsystems/Web/Panel.htm)**:
- Opening the panel sometimes failed if characters with diacritics (i.e. national dependent characters) were used in panel parameters.
- **The [PmgTrendViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgTrendViewer/PmgTrendViewer.htm) object** in JavaScript panels: Optimization of requests for large quantities or high frequency of queries.
- Pmg object rendering improved for old Web browser InternetExplorer 8.
- The patch has also been included into the version [Pm8.2.18](NewsPm802.htm#ver80218).
- **[PmOmronFINS](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmOmronFINS/PmOmronFINS.htm)** communication driver:
- This driver can communicate by the FINS protocol with new PLCs by the Omron company. The original the [PmOmronC](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmOmronC/PmOmronC.htm) communication driver is used for communication by the Mode-C protocol.
- Both drivers are licenced by common licence [PmOmron](PriceList/PriceList.htm#PriceList_PmOmron).

- **[PmSNMP](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmSNMP/PmSNMP.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** Request identifier used wrong format in transmitted data. Only the first 128 messages were trasmitted.
- **[PmModbusMr](Subsystems/Comm/PmDrivers/PmModbusMr/PmModbusMr.htm)** communication driver: **Fixed bug:** Reading and writing bit in the register (i.e. reading and writing area RoB) did not work correctly.
## Version 8.3.0 (from 26.9.2014) - developmental version

**NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES:**
- **[Data extensions](Objects/Others/PmVar/DExtn/DExtn.htm)**: Data extension is now an object with scripting interface.
- **The [PmVar.Extension](Objects/Others/PmVar/PropMeth/Extension.htm) method** can access this object. The data extension was available for variables of the [PmaData](Objects/Pma/PmaData/PmaData.htm) object, but now it can also be used with [PmaCommGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaCommGroup/PmaCommGroup.htm), [PmaOpcDaClientGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaOpcDaClientGroup/PmaOpcDaClientGroup.htm) and [PmaTrendGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaTrendGroup/PmaTrendGroup.htm) object variables. In these objects there is always just one extension "to itself", i.e. the [ExtComm](Objects/Others/PmVar/DExtn/ExtComm/ExtComm.htm), [ExtOpcDa](Objects/Others/PmVar/DExtn/ExtOpcDa/ExtOpcDa.htm) and [ExtTrend](Objects/Others/PmVar/DExtn/ExtTrend/ExtTrend.htm) data extension.
- The data extension object can also be addressed in the object path by means **of the [Data extensions](Objects/Others/PmVar/DExtn/DExtn.htm#HashExt) identifier**.
- **[PmaCommGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaCommGroup/PmaCommGroup.htm)** object: **The "["onDataReceive" event](Objects/Pma/PmaCommGroup/Cfg/Parameters.htm#Cfg_EventRcv)" configurator** can be set to "**A = call for all registered variables (in this object and also in other PmaData objects)**".

This way it is possible to check any change of any variable in the [onDataReceive](Objects/Pma/PmaCommGroup/Event/onDataReceive.htm) event.
- **[PmaOpcDaClientGroup](Objects/Pma/PmaOpcDaClientGroup/PmaOpcDaClientGroup.htm)** object: **The "["onDataReceive" event](Objects/Pma/PmaOpcDaClientGroup/Cfg/Parameters.htm#Cfg_EventRcv)" configurator** can be set to "**A = trigger the event for all registered variables (in this object and also in other PmaData objects)**". This way it is possible to check any change of any variable in the [onDataReceive](Objects/Pma/PmaOpcDaClientGroup/Event/onDataReceive.htm) event.
- **The "[Methods](Objects/Pma/PmaObject/Cfg/Methods.htm)" tab of the [PmaObject](Objects/Pma/PmaObject/PmaObject.htm) object**: Now this tab is present in each [Pma object](Objects/Pma/Pma.htm) and [Pmg object](Objects/Pmg/Pmg.htm) (only some specific Pma object had it before).
- **[Macro expression](Directions/Macro/Macro.htm)**: In configurators where macro expression can be entered, there is a new button on the left (similar to data binding button) that can be used for composing a macro expression by configuration.
- **[Development environment](DtEnv/DtEnv.htm)**:
- Major improvements of window design configuration [in application editor](DtEnv/DtEnv.htm) and [in panel editor](DtEnv/DtEnv.htm).
- In the object configuration window, there is an object path indicated on the up. Clicking this path can be used to navigate to any other object. This way it is possible to switch between object easily.
- Editing by keyboard (without mouse) is now supported: After pressing the Alt key shows the shortcut letters for each configurator and after pressing the letter the focus is moved to the selected configurator. The concept of such letter is hiearachic, i.e. some letter may represent a set of configurators and after pressing such letter another letters are indicated for sub-configurators. This way it is possible to move around quickly while designing an application.
- The "[Disable object at application launch](Objects/Pma/PmaObject/Cfg/Object.htm#Cfg_Disabled)" configurator is extended by the option to enter [Macro expression $.cfgfile](Directions/Macro/MacroCfgfile.htm) and this way it is possible to define which objects are to be activated in the application by defining them in the configuration file.
- The "[Object accessible via variable](Objects/Pma/PmaObject/Cfg/Object.htm#Cfg_RefEnable)" configurator is now considered obsolete and therefore it is hidden in new apps and in applications that did not use it.
- **[PmgRoot](Objects/Pmg/PmgRoot/PmgRoot.htm)** new object: new object that represents the whole graphic content of the panel.
- There is a single object of this type in each graphic panel. All internal panel properties were moved into this item, e.g. [Panel width](Objects/Pmg/PmgRoot/Cfg/Panel.htm#Cfg_RootDx), [Panel height](Objects/Pmg/PmgRoot/Cfg/Panel.htm#Cfg_RootDy), [Pmg object parameters](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/Cfg/Object.htm#Cfg_ItemPars), etc.
- There is a new icon in the toolbar [![](DtEnv/PmgEditor/EditRoot.png "Edit PmgRoot")(Edit the PmgRoot object)](DtEnv/PmgEditor/Pmg_MenuBar.htm#Icon_EditRoot).
- Each object has a new script **[PmgObject.Root](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/PropMeth/Root.htm) property** that can be used to access to the [PmgRoot](Objects/Pmg/PmgRoot/PmgRoot.htm) object in any event.
- **[PmgRoot.onViewerResize](Objects/Pmg/PmgRoot/Event/onViewerResize.htm)** event: In this event, it is possible to dynamically increase / decrease size and move objects in order to optimize the items displayed in the window of specific size.
- **[PmgObject.onModeChange](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/Event/onModeChange.htm)** event: New event in each Pmg object informs that:
- there is a mouse cursor hovering over the object
- the object got focus
- the [Visible](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/PropMeth/Visible.htm) or [Enabled](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/PropMeth/Enabled.htm) properties were changed.
- **[PmaPanel](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PmaPanel.htm)** object:
- **New "[Enable multiple opening of local panel](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/Cfg/Panel.htm#Cfg_MultiView)" configurator**. If is set, then the panel can be opened multiple times simultaneously (e.g. each time with different parameter).
- Many properties in this object are now considered obsolete because these properties are now contained in the [PmgRoot](Objects/Pmg/PmgRoot/PmgRoot.htm) object. Based on the fact that one panel can now be opened multiple times these properties in this object are no longer relevant.
- The option to save graphic content as template for other panels has been disabled. All such panels are converted automatically, i.e. this graphic content is copied into all [PmaPanel](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PmaPanel.htm) objects that used such template. As for templates, it is better to use the [PmaPrototype](Objects/Pma/PmaPrototype/PmaPrototype.htm) object.
- **[Alarm and Event system](Subsystems/AlEv/AlarmEvent.htm)**:
- The history can now be saved also to **Database MS SQL Server cyclic** and **Database Oracle cyclic** (see the "[Storage type](Objects/Pma/PmaAlarmGroup/Cfg/Storage.htm#Cfg_Type)" configurator).
- History viewer:
- The scrollbar has been replaced by buttons "up" and "down".
- Sorting by the time of origin is now functional, i.e. new alarms now can be displayed on up.
- The state and history viewer can now be opened multiple times, i.e. to have a small window permanently open and open large window sometimes.
- **Panel editor:**
- In configurators, where [data binding](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/DBinds/GroupDBind.htm) is defined, such data binding is displayed in text form under the configurator and can be edited directly. This can speed up its editing or copying.
- **New "[Render outline frame around the focused object](Objects/Pmg/PmgObject/Cfg/Object.htm#Cfg_FocusType)" configurator** in each Pmg object.
- **Licences:**
- The pricelist item PmBaseClient was renamed to **[PmDataClient](PriceList/LicencePmClients.htm#DataClient)** and PmFullClient to **[PmWebClient](PriceList/LicencePmClients.htm#WebClient)**.
- Now it is possible to enter the **HW Key testing order** and this way for example prefer the development key before runtime key. Setting is done in the [*Application*.ini](Directions/PmFilesApp.htm#File_AppIni) file - see [Description of keys in the [Licence] section](Directions/PmAppIniFile.htm#Ch_Licence).
- [Network licence key](PriceList/LicMedia/NetLicFile.htm): Now a single swk file can contain a "**multilicence**", i.e. single file can be shared by multiple applications.
- **[How to create an application using different national languages](Subsystems/Languages/AppNatLang.htm)**: Added new supported runtime national languages: **Ukrainian** (uk), **Greek** (el) and **Persian** (fa).
- **[INFO system](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm)**: Now can be opened multiple windows simultaneously - see the "[Open new](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm#Butt_OpenNew)" button.
- **[PmaComm.GetCount](Objects/Pma/PmaComm/PropMeth/GetCount.htm)** method: Can be used for counting the total number of communication transfers.
