Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability resides within the Oracle GoldenGate `mgr` process, which listens on TCP port 7809.
*   The `mgr` process does not authenticate connecting machines before allowing them to write arbitrary files with whitelisted names on the server. This lack of authentication allows unauthenticated remote attackers to write files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The core issue is the absence of authentication for connections to the `mgr` process.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Unauthenticated remote attackers are allowed to write files with whitelisted names on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can leverage the file write vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server under the context of the SYSTEM user, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation gives the attacker the ability to run code with the highest level of privileges, potentially allowing them to install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Connection:** No authentication is required for a remote attacker to connect to the vulnerable service and exploit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the target server on TCP port 7809.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or prior authentication to initiate the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory explicitly mentions the vulnerability can be exploited to execute code under the context of SYSTEM user.
* Oracle has released an update to address this vulnerability.
