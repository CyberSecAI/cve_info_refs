- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially-crafted DRDA (Distributed Relational Database Architecture) message can cause the DB2 server to terminate abnormally.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of malformed DRDA messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (DoS) due to abnormal termination of the DB2 server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially-crafted DRDA message over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated DB2 user and able to send network messages to the vulnerable DB2 server.
