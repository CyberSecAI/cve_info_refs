Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-0420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **missing authentication check for critical functions** within the JD Edwards Server Manager. Specifically, the methods used to create new users and assign roles could be accessed without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication (CWE-306):** The core issue is the lack of authentication required to execute the methods `addLocalUser` and `grantUserRole`, which are responsible for creating users and assigning roles within the Server Manager.
*   **Unrestricted Access:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to invoke these methods directly, bypassing access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Creation:** An unauthenticated attacker can create new user accounts with arbitrary usernames and passwords in the JD Edwards Server Manager.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can assign administrative roles to the newly created accounts.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With a newly created administrative user, the attacker can log into the Server Manager and gain complete control over all JD Edwards servers, information, and processes. This leads to a critical compromise of the entire JDE landscape.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network access.
*   **Direct Method Invocation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by directly invoking the `addLocalUser` and `grantUserRole` methods, which are part of the Java Management Extensions (JMX) interface used by the Server Manager. This interface uses the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the JD Edwards Server Manager.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update released in January 2016.
*   Onapsis assigned a CVSS v2 score of 10 (Critical) and a CVSS v3 score of 10 (Critical) while Oracle assigned a CVSS v2 score of 7.8 (High).
