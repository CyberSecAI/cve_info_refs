## Security Update for Microsoft Office (3155544)

Published: May 10, 2016 | Updated: August 9, 2016

**Version:** 2.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory, and by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3155544](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3155544).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.

Note that where the severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector for [CVE-2016-0198](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0198). The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts.

The following tables contain links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0126](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0126) | No | No |
| Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0140](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0140) | No | No |

## Microsoft Office Graphics RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0183

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action, typically by getting the user to click a link in an email or in an Instant Messenger message that takes the user to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.

Note that where the severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector for [CVE-2016-0183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0183). The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

**Workaround for CVE-2016-0183**

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent Office from opening RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **For Office 2007**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

     `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]`
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **1**.

     **Note** To use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2007, all of the latest Office 2007 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.

  **For Office 2010**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

     `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]`
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **2**.
  3. Set the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value to **0**.

  **For Office 2013**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

     `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]`
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **2**.
  3. Set the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value to **0**.

  **Impact of Workaround**. Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922849](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922849) will be unable to open documents saved in the RTF format.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  **For Office 2007**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

     `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]`
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.

  **For Office 2010**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

     `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]`
  2. Set the **RtfFiles** DWORD value to **0**.
  3. Leave the **OpenInProtectedView** DWORD value set to **0**.

  **For Office 2013**

  1. Run **regedit.exe** as Administrator and navigate to the following subkey:

     `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Security\FileBlock]`
