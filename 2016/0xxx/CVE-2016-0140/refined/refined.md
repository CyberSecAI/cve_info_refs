The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2016-0140, within the context of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-054.

**CVE-2016-0140 - Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain control of the affected system, potentially installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.
