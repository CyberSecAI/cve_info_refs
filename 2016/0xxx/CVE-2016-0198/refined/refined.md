Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-0198:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory, specifically related to embedded fonts.
- The Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability
- Remote code execution vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take full control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts.

- **File-sharing attack:** Providing a specially crafted document and convincing a user to open it.
- **Preview Pane:** The Preview Pane in affected software is also an attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file with malicious embedded fonts.
- Ability to deliver the file to a target user, either through email, a website, or file sharing.
- Social engineering to convince the user to open the file or visit a malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles objects in memory and how the Windows font library handles embedded fonts.
- The vulnerability affects various versions of Microsoft Office, including Word, Compatibility Pack, and Viewer.
- Microsoft indicated that the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited.
