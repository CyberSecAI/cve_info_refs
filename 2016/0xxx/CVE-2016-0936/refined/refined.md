Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0936:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate that indexes used to access data within allocated buffers are within the bounds of that buffer. This occurs when handling PDFs containing embedded JPEG2000 files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Indexing:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds indexing vulnerability, meaning that a program attempts to access a memory location outside the boundaries of the allocated buffer. This is a type of memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Context:** The code execution occurs under the context of the current process, which is typically the user's context, potentially leading to full control over user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted embedded JPEG2000 file designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read/write.
*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can embed the malicious PDF on a website that the user has to visit.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, as the user has to open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious website serving the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need direct physical access to the target system.
*   **Crafting Malicious Files/Websites:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious PDF files or control a website that delivers the malicious PDF.
*   **Social Engineering (implied):**  The attacker likely needs to entice the user to open the malicious file or visit a compromised web page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of JPEG2000 files embedded within PDF documents.
*   Adobe released a security update to fix this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users were protected via a specific filter (ID '21925').
