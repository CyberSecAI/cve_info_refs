# Jenkins Security Advisory 2016-02-24

This advisory announces multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins.

## Description

### Remote code execution vulnerability in remoting module

**SECURITY-232 / CVE-2016-0788**

A vulnerability in the Jenkins remoting module allowed unauthenticated remote attackers to open a JRMP listener on the server hosting the Jenkins controller process, which allowed arbitrary code execution.

### HTTP response splitting vulnerability

**SECURITY-238 / CVE-2016-0789**

An HTTP response splitting vulnerability in the CLI command documentation allowed attackers to craft Jenkins URLs that serve malicious content.

### Non-constant time comparison of API token

**SECURITY-241 / CVE-2016-0790**

The verification of user-provided API tokens with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm, potentially allowing attackers to use statistical methods to determine valid API tokens using brute-force methods.

### Non-constant time comparison of CSRF crumbs

**SECURITY-245 / CVE-2016-0791**

The verification of user-provided CSRF crumbs with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm, potentially allowing attackers to use statistical methods to determine valid CSRF crumbs using brute-force methods.

### Remote code execution through remote API

**SECURITY-247 / CVE-2016-0792**

Jenkins has several API endpoints that allow low-privilege users to POST XML files that then get deserialized by Jenkins. Maliciously crafted XML files sent to these API endpoints could result in arbitrary code execution.

## Severity

* SECURITY-232 is considered **[critical](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)** as it allows unprivileged attackers to execute arbitrary code in many configurations.
* SECURITY-238 is considered **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)** as it allows unprivileged attackers to send maliciously crafted links that result e.g. in XSS to victims.
* SECURITY-241 is considered **[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)** as it allows unprivileged attackers to brute-force valid login credentials.
* SECURITY-245 is considered **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)** as it allows unprivileged attackers to brute-force CSRF protection.
* SECURITY-247 is considered **[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)** as it allows low-privilege attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

## Affected versions

* All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 1.649
* All Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 1.642.1

## Fix

* Jenkins main line users should update to 1.650
* Jenkins LTS users should update to 1.642.2

These versions include fixes to all the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Credit

The Jenkins project would like to thank the following people for discovering and [reporting](/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities) these vulnerabilities:

* **Moritz Bechler** for SECURITY-232
* **Seung-Hyun Cho** for SECURITY-238
* **Steve Marlowe <smarlowe@cisco.com> of Cisco ASIG** for SECURITY-241
* **James Nord, CloudBees, Inc.** for SECURITY-245
* **Arshan Dabirsiaghi, Contrast Security** for SECURITY-247

I believe I have the appropriate insecure registry settings for both my docker daemon and the image stream.  While I continue to investigate the issue with my test environment, I'd like to get two pieces of information from QA:  1) The json/yaml for the jenkins image stream that you used.  2) A repro of the problem being seen with verbose logging turned on for the "verify openshift service" step.  The specific java exception on the connection attempt could prove instructive.  NOTE: while I can't bring up the image in an openshift pod, I was able to bring it up in a docker container and confirm the correct version of the plugin is installed.  thanks, gabe   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c7)  Gabe Montero    2016-04-12 18:24:42 UTC  ``` Update: while I still can't import brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7:1.642-28 into an ImageStream, I was able to run it external from OpenShift and manually provide the API endpoint / project / token.  Doing so, I was able to verify a running service repeatedly.  So to QA, please still provide 1) and 2) from #[Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c6).  Also, a confirmation that brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7:1.642-28 is the correct image to be testing would be good too.  thanks, gabe   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c9)  Gabe Montero    2016-04-13 17:37:47 UTC  ``` Hi XiuJuan Wang,  First, yes, certainly this item with the verify openshift service build step should not block any security validations as noted in the title of this bug, or 3.2 ultimately shipping, so thanks for moving the bug to verify.  Next, thanks for the confirm on the image and info on how you imported it into your OpenShift.  Using that methodology, I was able to bring brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7:1.642-28 (a414317f519d) in a Pod, etc.  However, I ran the job repeatedly and saw no issues.  As to your question as to why it is occurring for you, I go back to what I mentioned in item 2) in #[Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c7).  If we want to nail down why you are getting the failure, we need the verbose logging to see exactly what java exception is occurring.  I suspect it is something like a socket timeout, but let's get the data and go from there.  Based on the findings, if need be, most likely we can open a low sev, post 3.2 bugzilla to track workarounds (for example, if it is a socket timeout, we can see if making the socket connect timeout value configurable helps.  thanks again ... gabe   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c10)  XiuJuan Wang    2016-04-14 08:55:46 UTC  ``` Hi,Gabe Sometimes I can reproduce 2) in #[comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c7), maybe the network is not stable between US and our office. Anyway,I will keep an eye on this issue if it's a real problem. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c11)  Gabe Montero    2016-04-14 13:25:42 UTC  ``` Sounds good .... yeah, if I read you correctly and you are seeing it intermittently, I bet it is a connection timeout.  But keep an eye on it as you say and based on any data you capture we can go from there. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1324664#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-05-03 15:32:38 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact

## Description

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or
private cloud deployments.

* The Jenkins continuous integration server has been updated to upstream

version 1.651.2 LTS that addresses a large number of security issues,
including open redirects, a potential denial of service, unsafe handling of
user provided environment variables and several instances of sensitive
information disclosure. (CVE-2014-3577, CVE-2016-0788, CVE-2016-0789,
CVE-2016-0790, CVE-2016-0791, CVE-2016-0792, CVE-2016-3721, CVE-2016-3722,
CVE-2016-3723, CVE-2016-3724, CVE-2016-3725, CVE-2016-3726, CVE-2016-3727,
