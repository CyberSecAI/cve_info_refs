  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2016-0790",
    "description": "The verification of user-provided API tokens with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm, potentially allowing attackers to use statistical methods to determine valid API tokens using brute-force methods.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 1.649",
      "All Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 1.642.1"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "Jenkins main line users should update to 1.650",
      "Jenkins LTS users should update to 1.642.2"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Non-constant time comparison of API tokens.",
    "weakness": "The verification of user-provided API tokens with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm.",
    "impact": "Attackers can use statistical methods to determine valid API tokens using brute-force methods.",
    "attack_vector": "Network access to the Jenkins instance.",
     "required_capabilities": "Ability to send API token verification requests.",
    "remediation": "Update to Jenkins version 1.650 or 1.642.2"
