## Cumulative Security Update for JScript and VBScript (3156764)

Published: May 10, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in the JScript and VBScript scripting engines in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user visits a specially crafted website. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for affected versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines on supported releases of Windows Vista, and Moderate on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the **AffectedSoftware** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the JScript and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **VulnerabilityInformation** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3156764](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3156764).

## Update FAQ

**Why do I see both JScript.dll and VBScript.dll in the packages for this cumulative security update?**

This security update ships as a cumulative update for the JScript and VBScript scripting engines. While both engines are included in this release, the components affected by the security fixes covered by this bulletin are listed above in the section **AffectedSoftware**.

**How do I determine which versions of JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on my system?**

The JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed with supported releases of Microsoft Windows. In addition, installing a newer version of Internet Explorer on a system can change the versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines that are installed.

To determine which versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engines are installed on your system, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Navigate to the **%systemroot%\system32** directory.
3. For VBScript, right-click **vbscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.
4. For JScript, right-click **jscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab.

The version number is listed in the **File Version** field. If your file version starts with 5.8, for example 5.8.7600.16385, then VBScript 5.8 is installed on your system.

\*\*Once I know the versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engine installed on my system, where do I get the update? \*\*
The affected software in this bulletin apply to systems without Internet Explorer installed and to systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier versions installed. Customers with systems running Internet Explorer 8 or later should apply the Internet Explorer Cumulative Update ([MS16-051](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=785873)), which also addresses the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the JScript and VBScript engines render when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the JScript and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory. The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0187](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0187) | No | No |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0189](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0189) | No | Yes |

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that the JScript and VBScript engines render when handling objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the JScript and VBScript scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

    ```
    takeown /f %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll
            cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N
            cacls %windir%\syswow64\jscript.dll /E /P everyone:N

    ```

    **Impact of Workaround.** Websites that use VBScript or JScript may not work properly.

    **How to undo the workaround.**
  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    cacls %windir%\system32\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
    cacls %windir%\system32\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\vbscript.dll /E /R everyone
    cacls %windir%\syswow64\jscript.dll /E /R everyone

    ```

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Internet Explorer Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0188

A security feature bypass vulnerability for Internet Explorer exists in the User Mode Code Integrity (UMCI) component of Device Guard, when it improperly validates code integrity. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute unsigned code that would normally be blocked by UMCI.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run unsigned malicious code as though it were signed by a trusted source. The updates address the vulnerability by correcting how Internet Explorer validates code integrity.

## Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0192

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

## Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2016-0194

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly handle file access permissions, which could allow an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the user's computer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed. Note that the vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate a userâs rights directly, but the vulnerability could be used to obtain information in an attempt to further compromise the affected system.

In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that file access permissions are properly validated before returning file data to the user.
