Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-0187:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the JScript and VBScript engines handle objects in memory. Improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in the JScript and VBScript engines.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convinces a user to visit the website.
- Embedding in applications or documents: An attacker could embed a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can leverage compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content or ads to inject malicious code exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website, embed content in a document, or compromise a site to deliver malicious content.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., visit a website or open a document).
