The provided content is related to CVE-2016-0139.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Memory corruption vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow remote code execution, enabling an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. In email scenarios, the attacker sends the malicious file to the user. In web-based attacks, the attacker hosts the file on a website or uses a compromised website to host the file and entice the victim to open it. For some vulnerabilities including CVE-2016-0127 the preview pane is an attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted file and then convince a user to open it. There's no way for an attacker to force a user to open the file, so social engineering or enticement is needed to accomplish this.
