- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap storage allocated on an error path is not deallocated by queue manager agents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper resource management, specifically a heap storage leak on an error path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can cause a denial of service by repeatedly triggering the error path, leading to exhaustion of storage for the agent.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user can use an application to repeatedly cause the queue manager to execute the error path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to interact with the queue manager in a way that triggers the specific error path.
