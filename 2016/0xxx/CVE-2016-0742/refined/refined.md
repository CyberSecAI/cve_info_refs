  "CVE-2016-0742": {
    "Description": "The resolver in nginx before 1.8.1 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and worker process crash) via a crafted UDP DNS response.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The resolver in nginx doesn't properly handle crafted UDP DNS responses.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Invalid pointer dereference.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (worker process crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted UDP DNS response.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of forging UDP packets from the DNS server."
  },
  "CVE-2016-0746": {
    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the resolver in nginx 0.6.18 through 1.8.0 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker process crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted DNS response related to CNAME response processing.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of CNAME responses in the resolver.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free condition.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (worker process crash) or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted DNS response with CNAME records.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of triggering name resolution."
  },
   "CVE-2016-0747": {
    "Description": "The resolver in nginx before 1.8.1 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 does not properly limit CNAME resolution, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker process resource consumption) via vectors related to arbitrary name resolution.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient limitation of CNAME resolution by the resolver.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate limits on CNAME resolution leading to excessive resource consumption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (worker process resource consumption).",

  "CVE-2016-4450": {
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the nginx code responsible for saving client request body to a temporary file. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request that would cause nginx worker process to crash.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "NULL pointer dereference when saving client request body to a temporary file.",
