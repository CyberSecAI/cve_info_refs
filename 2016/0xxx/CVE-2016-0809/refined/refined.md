Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the `wifi_cleanup()` function in the Broadcom Wi-Fi driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The code releases a reference to a command (`cmd`) before potentially calling `getType()` on it. If `getType()` is called after the reference is released, it leads to a use-after-free condition and a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the System context, which provides elevated capabilities. This means an attacker could gain access to permissions not normally available to third-party apps, giving them control over aspects of the system they shouldn't have.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability could be used to gain "normal" capabilities remotely and that these permissions are generally only accessible to third-party apps installed locally. It seems there are local privilege escalation and remote (in local proximity) exploitation scenarios possible.
*   The device is vulnerable while in local proximity to an attacker, suggesting this might be exploited over Wi-Fi.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Proximity-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited while in local proximity to the device, likely through Wi-Fi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local App Installation:** The attacker needs the ability to install a malicious application on the target device.
*   **Local Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within local proximity of the target device, likely on the same Wi-Fi network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring the reference to the `cmd` object is released *after* the potential call to `getType()`.
*   The commit fixing this vulnerability is  `2c5a4fac8bc8198f6a2635ede776f8de40a0c3e1`
*   The vulnerability is rated as **High** severity because it can grant a malicious application access to system-level permissions, potentially leading to further compromise.
