{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a failure in the Windows kernel-mode driver to properly handle objects in memory. Specifically, the issue lies in the failure to increment a reference counter prior to calling userland code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. This leads to elevation of privileges and complete control over the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attack: The attacker would first have to log on to the target system and then execute a specially crafted application."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid logon to the target system and be able to execute an application. The attacker would need to craft a malicious application to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free in the handling of Window objects via xxxEndDeferWindowPosEx."
  }
