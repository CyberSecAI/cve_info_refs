Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1805 in the Linux kernel's pipe buffer handling. Specifically, after an unsuccessful atomic read operation from a pipe, the kernel failed to maintain correct synchronization between the buffer offset and buffer length. This flaw was present in a certain backport of the Linux kernel, and not in the upstream kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Pipe Buffer State Corruption:** The primary vulnerability is a pipe buffer state corruption. This occurs due to the kernel not correctly handling cases where atomic read operations from a pipe fail, leading to inconsistencies in the state of the pipe buffer.
*   **Incorrect Handling of Failed Atomic Reads:** The vulnerability arises because of how the kernel's pipe implementation handles failed atomic read operations.  Instead of proper rollback, the kernel code doesn't restore the state, leading to an inconsistent state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A local, unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to cause a system crash.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability could also potentially lead to privilege escalation by an attacker. This is noted in some sources as "possibly gain privileges via a crafted application" and "execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges,".
*   **Kernel Memory Leak:** Some sources mention the possibility of leaking kernel memory to user space.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user.
*   **Crafted Application:** Attackers need a crafted application to trigger this flaw.
*   **Pipe Manipulation:** The crafted application exploits the improper handling of failed atomic reads within the kernel's pipe implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute programs to exploit the incorrect pipe state handling

**Additional Information:**

*   **Specific Kernel Backports:** The vulnerability is specifically mentioned as being present in a Linux kernel backport in the linux package before 3.2.73-2+deb7u3 on Debian wheezy and the kernel package before 3.10.0-229.26.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1.
*   **Multiple Fixes:** It appears that the initial fix for the root cause was inadequate and that further patches were required for this CVE.
