Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform disclosing server file path information when Birt reports are rendered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The system is revealing internal server file paths, which can be sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of Server File Paths: An attacker could obtain knowledge of the internal structure and location of files on the server. This information can be used in further attacks, such as locating configuration files, sensitive data, or other attack vectors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Rendering Birt Reports: The vulnerability is triggered when Birt reports are rendered. The specific method for an attacker to initiate the rendering of such a report is not detailed, but it is likely through the application's user interface or API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Application: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the TRIRIGA application in order to trigger the rendering of Birt reports. Depending on the application's accessibility, this could mean having a valid user account, or being able to send specially crafted requests to an externally accessible interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- Fixes are available in specific fix packs for the affected versions, which address the information disclosure issue.
- Workarounds are suggested, like restricting access to internal networks, until fixes can be applied.
- The document also emphasizes that the CVSS Environment Score is customer specific and will affect the overall CVSS Score.
