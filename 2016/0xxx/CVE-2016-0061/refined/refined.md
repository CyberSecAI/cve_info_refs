Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0061:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft browsers (both Internet Explorer and Edge) improperly access objects in memory. Specifically for Internet Explorer, the issue relates to how the browser handles HTML form elements.
- By performing certain script actions, an attacker can cause Internet Explorer to read the `id` or `name` of a form element and interpret it as a pointer. This type confusion leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- Type confusion related to HTML form element handling in Internet Explorer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) under the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take full control of the system, potentially installing programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would need to convince a user to visit the malicious page.
- **Email/messaging based attack:** Attackers could use email or instant messages with links to malicious sites or attachments containing malicious content.
- Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content: Attackers could inject malicious content that exploits the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or send a user a malicious file/link.
- The user must interact with the malicious content by visiting a website or opening a file.
- No other special privileges are required.

**Additional details (from ZDI advisory):**

- This vulnerability is a Type Confusion vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability is triggered by reading the `id` or `name` of a form element and interpreting it as a pointer.
- ZDI assigned the identifier ZDI-16-162 to this vulnerability.

**Summary of differences between Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer:**

- While both browsers are affected by CVE-2016-0061, the root cause is slightly different in each case. For Edge, the vulnerability lies in how it improperly accesses objects in memory. In Internet Explorer, the root cause is due to the improper handling of HTML form elements.

- Both browsers exhibit a memory corruption vulnerability that could lead to RCE.

- The ZDI advisory specifically references Internet Explorer.

- Both Microsoft documents indicate a similar attack vector: the user must be convinced to browse to a malicious page.
