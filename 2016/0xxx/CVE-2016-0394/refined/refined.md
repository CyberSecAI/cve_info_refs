- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect file permissions are set for an object during the installation process on Unix platforms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the incorrect permissions assigned to certain files and directories under the `/isadc` directory within the installation path of IBM Integration Bus and WebSphere Message Broker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can potentially manipulate certain files due to the overly permissive file permissions, although the specific nature of the manipulation is not detailed, the impact is labeled as "Low" in terms of integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where IBM Integration Bus or WebSphere Message Broker is installed.
