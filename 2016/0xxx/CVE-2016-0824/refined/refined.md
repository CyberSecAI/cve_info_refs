Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue within `libstagefright`, specifically in how it handles bitstream access. The vulnerability allows an attacker to read beyond the allocated buffer size during media processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read due to improper bitstream access. Specifically, the code does not properly ensure that reads stay within the bounds of allocated memory, allowing an attacker to potentially access sensitive information beyond the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially bypass security measures and gain elevated capabilities by reading data beyond the allocated buffer. This can lead to unintended information disclosure and access to privileges not normally available to third-party apps, including signature or signatureOrSystem permission privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Media file processing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of media files.
- **Remote content:** This issue can be exploited via remote content such as MMS messages or browser playback of media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted media file to the affected system.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the parsing of this crafted media file.
- No special privileges or user interaction is explicitly mentioned, meaning it can be exploited by any app that handles media processing.
