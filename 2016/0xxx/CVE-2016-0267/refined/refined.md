Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the storage of sensitive information, such as passwords, in plain text within the IBM UrbanCode Deploy database and the server UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Plain Text Storage:** Secure properties, including passwords, are stored in plain text.
- **Information Disclosure:** An authenticated user can obtain these plain text properties through the server UI. Also, a user with read permissions to the database can obtain them directly from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, like passwords, that can be used to access other systems.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access and control over other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Server UI Access:** An authenticated user can access secure properties through the applicationâ€™s user interface.
- **Direct Database Access:** An attacker with read access to the database can directly retrieve sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of IBM UrbanCode Deploy to exploit the vulnerability through the server UI.
- **Database Access:** The attacker needs read access to the IBM UrbanCode Deploy database to exploit the vulnerability directly through the database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in a wide range of IBM UrbanCode Deploy versions (6.0 to 6.2.1).
- The provided CVSS vector is: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating a vulnerability that can be exploited over a network with low attack complexity by a low-privileged user, resulting in high impact on confidentiality.
- Patches are available for the affected versions.
