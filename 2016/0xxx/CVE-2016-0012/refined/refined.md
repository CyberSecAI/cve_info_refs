Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-0012:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Office's failure to properly implement the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature. This allows an attacker to more reliably predict memory offsets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of ASLR, a security feature designed to randomize memory locations, making it harder for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass ASLR. This bypass alone doesn't allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Facilitation of Further Exploitation:**  The ASLR bypass can be combined with another vulnerability, like a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, to enable more reliable arbitrary code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browsing Scenario:** Exploitation is possible when a user browses to a malicious website while logged in and using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office.
- **Chained Exploitation:** This vulnerability is not directly exploitable by itself, it needs to be chained with another exploit for arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Website Hosting:** The attacker needs the ability to host or control a malicious website.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to browse to the malicious website.
- **Chained Exploitation:** The attacker needs to discover and exploit another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to successfully leverage this ASLR bypass.

**Additional Notes:**
- Microsoft was not aware of any attacks exploiting this vulnerability at the time of the security bulletin's original release.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring Microsoft Office correctly implements the ASLR security feature.
- This vulnerability is classified as "Important" in terms of severity.
