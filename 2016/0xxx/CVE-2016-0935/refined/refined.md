Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-0935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Reader handles the `ExtGState` dictionary within PDF files. Specifically, malformed dictionaries lead to a double free condition during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The core issue is a double free vulnerability. This occurs when memory that has already been freed is freed again, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (Adobe Reader). This means the attacker can potentially gain full control of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF file that contains a malformed `ExtGState` dictionary.
- **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could also host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when a user visits it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page.
- **Knowledge of PDF Structure:** The attacker needs detailed knowledge of PDF file structure and the `ExtGState` dictionary to craft the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2015-09-03, and a coordinated public release occurred on 2016-01-12.
- Adobe has released security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Reader on both Windows and Macintosh.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['21932'].

**Summary of CVE-2016-0935:**
This CVE identifies a double-free vulnerability in Adobe Reader's handling of `ExtGState` dictionaries within PDF files. By crafting malicious PDFs or directing users to malicious webpages, attackers can trigger a double free condition leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. User interaction is required to trigger the exploit, by opening the malicious file or webpage.
