- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input in IBM Cognos TM1.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website. This can lead to stealing the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially-crafted URL containing malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL, and the victim needs to click the crafted URL. A low privileged attacker is sufficient for this attack.
