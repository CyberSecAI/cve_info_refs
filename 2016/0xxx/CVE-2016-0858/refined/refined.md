Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2016-0858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the Advantech WebAccess software when handling a specially crafted request. This race condition leads to a buffer overflow in a shared virtual memory area. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the implementation of the `0x7920 IOCTL` within the Kernel subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Shared Virtual Memory Overflow:**  A `strcpy` call within the shared virtual memory area is vulnerable to an overflow, triggered by the race condition.
*   **Improper Synchronization:** The core issue lies in the concurrent execution using a shared resource without proper synchronization, which is a classic race condition leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator of the system. This level of access would allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
*   **Denial of Service:** The buffer overflow could potentially also cause a denial of service through system crash.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** According to the CVSS v3 score (9.8), successful exploitation has high impact on all three security goals.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, indicating no requirement for local access to initiate the attack.
*   **Network:** The attack occurs via network interaction through the vulnerable software components, i.e. the Advantech WebAccess.
*   **Specially Crafted Request:** The trigger is a specifically crafted request targeted at the Kernel service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability without any authentication, meaning an unauthenticated user on the network can initiate the attack.
*   **Low Skill Level:** According to the ICS-CERT advisory, a low-skill attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) advisory provides a more precise CVSS v2 score of 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) which indicates that access complexity is medium, as opposed to the CVSS v3 score (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   The vulnerability is present in the `datacore.exe` service.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a filter.
