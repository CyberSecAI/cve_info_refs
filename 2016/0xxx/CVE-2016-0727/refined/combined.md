### Bug Description

The cronjob script bundled with ntp package on Ubuntu Wily is intended to perform cleanup on statistics files produced by NTP daemon running with statistics enabled. The script is run as root during the daily cronjobs all operations on the ntp-user controlled statistics directory without switching to user ntp. Thus all steps are performed with root permissions in place.

Due to multiple bugs in the script, a malicious ntp user can make the backup process to overwrite arbitrary files with content controlled by the attacker, thus gaining root privileges. The problematic parts in /etc/cron.daily/ntp are:

find "$statsdir" -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;

# compress whatever is left to save space

cd "$statsdir"

ls \*stats.???????? > /dev/null 2>&1

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

  # Note that gzip won't compress the file names that

  # are hard links to the live/current files, so this

  # compresses yesterday and previous, leaving the live

  # log alone. We supress the warnings gzip issues

  # about not compressing the linked file.

  gzip --best --quiet \*stats.????????

Relevant targets are:

find and rm invocation is racy, symlinks on rm

    rm can be invoked with one attacker controlled option

    ls can be invoked with arbitrary number of attacker controlled command line options

    gzip can be invoked with arbitrary number of attacker controlled options

Thank you for the report halfdog; we're currently on holidays with very little coverage until the new year. Do you mind if we investigate this further in the new year?

Thanks for the fine report! Good work as always.

I have already informed NTP upstream, but I guess they will also need some time to do their work. I will try to assist upstream in fixing and hold the issue back from my side. So unless upstream wants to march on at their pace or unless you have objections, I would try to kick it into the oss-security distros list around 2015-12-30, thus you having time till 2016-01-12 before embargo time ends (unless other distros have objections).

I'm afraid this might have been lost in tracking.

Also adding Security team (since it is a CVE) and setting triaged as a patch that seems reasonable is available.

# USN-3096-1: NTP vulnerabilities

5 October 2016

Several security issues were fixed in NTP.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [ntp](/security/cves?package=ntp) - Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs

## Details

Aanchal Malhotra discovered that NTP incorrectly handled authenticated

broadcast mode. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform a replay

attack. ([CVE-2015-7973](/security/CVE-2015-7973))

Matt Street discovered that NTP incorrectly verified peer associations of

symmetric keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform an

impersonation attack. ([CVE-2015-7974](/security/CVE-2015-7974))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled

memory. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ntpq to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. ([CVE-2015-7975](/security/CVE-2015-7975))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled

dangerous characters in filenames. An attacker could possibly use this

issue to overwrite arbitrary files. ([CVE-2015-7976](/security/CVE-2015-7976))

Stephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled large restrict lists.

An attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a

denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7977](/security/CVE-2015-7977), [CVE-2015-7978](/security/CVE-2015-7978))

Aanchal Malhotra discovered that NTP incorrectly handled authenticated

broadcast mode. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7979](/security/CVE-2015-7979))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that NTP incorrectly handled origin timestamp

checks. A remote attacker could use this issue to spoof peer servers.

([CVE-2015-8138](/security/CVE-2015-8138))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility did not properly

handle certain incorrect values. An attacker could possibly use this issue

to cause ntpq to hang, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8158](/security/CVE-2015-8158))

It was discovered that the NTP cronjob incorrectly cleaned up the

statistics directory. A local attacker could possibly use this to escalate

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0727](/security/CVE-2016-0727))

Stephen Gray and Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly

validated crypto-NAKs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

prevent clients from synchronizing. ([CVE-2016-1547](/security/CVE-2016-1547))

Miroslav Lichvar and Jonathan Gardner discovered that NTP incorrectly

handled switching to interleaved symmetric mode. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to prevent clients from synchronizing.

([CVE-2016-1548](/security/CVE-2016-1548))

Matthew Van Gundy, Stephen Gray and Loganaden Velvindron discovered that

NTP incorrectly handled message authentication. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to recover the message digest key. ([CVE-2016-1550](/security/CVE-2016-1550))

Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled duplicate IPs on

unconfig directives. An authenticated remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2016-2516](/security/CVE-2016-2516))

Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certail peer

associations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP

to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2518](/security/CVE-2016-2518))

Jakub Prokes discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed

packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2016-4954](/security/CVE-2016-4954))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain packets

when autokey is enabled. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4955](/security/CVE-2016-4955))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed

broadcast packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4956](/security/CVE-2016-4956))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the NTP

AppArmor profile.
