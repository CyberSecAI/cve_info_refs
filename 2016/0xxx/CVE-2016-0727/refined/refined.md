{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the cronjob script bundled with the ntp package allow a malicious ntp user to manipulate the backup process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The cronjob script, which runs as root, operates on the ntp-user controlled statistics directory without switching to the ntp user.",
      "The script's use of `find`, `rm`, `ls`, and `gzip` is vulnerable to command injection and race conditions due to attacker-controlled inputs.",
      "Specifically:\n    - `find` and `rm` are racy with symlinks on `rm` and `rm` can be invoked with an attacker-controlled option.\n    - `ls` can be invoked with an arbitrary number of attacker-controlled command line options.\n    - `gzip` can be invoked with an arbitrary number of attacker-controlled options."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious ntp user can overwrite arbitrary files with attacker-controlled content, leading to privilege escalation and potentially gaining root privileges.",
    "attack_vector": "Local attack, exploiting the insecure cronjob script executed with root privileges.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with control over the ntp user and its statistics directory."
