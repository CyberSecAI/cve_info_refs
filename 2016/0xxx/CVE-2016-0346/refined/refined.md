- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input in IBM Cognos Business Intelligence.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by a victim, which would execute within the security context of the hosting website. This can lead to stealing of cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL is used to inject malicious script into a web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and the victim needs to view the page containing the injected script (requires user interaction). Also, the attacker must have low privileges to carry out this attack.
