Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-0107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, specifically during the layout of HTML tables.
*   The issue is related to how Internet Explorer keeps track of table rows when performing layout of HTML tables.
*   By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can cause Internet Explorer to read beyond the end of an array of pointers to CTableRow objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** Improper access of objects in memory, leading to a heap out-of-bounds read.
*  **Out-of-Bounds Read:** Reading memory outside the intended buffer, specifically an array of pointers to CTableRow objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control over the system.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially Crafted Website:** An attacker hosts a website designed to trigger the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into legitimate websites or sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
*   **Email/Instant Messenger:** An attacker could entice users to open malicious attachments or click on links to malicious sites via email or instant messaging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by hosting or injecting malicious content.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The victim must visit a malicious website or open a malicious file. The attacker cannot force the user to view the content. They need to convince the user to take action, such as clicking a link or opening an attachment.
