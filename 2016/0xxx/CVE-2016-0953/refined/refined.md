Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue that occurs while parsing malformed IFF files within Adobe Photoshop CC and Bridge CC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Memory Corruption:** A malformed IFF file can cause a heap memory corruption. This is due to improper handling of the IFF file structure, leading to out-of-bounds write or read operations.
- This vulnerability is classified as a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the application. This could enable the attacker to gain full control over the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker provides a crafted, malicious IFF file.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious file using the vulnerable Adobe software. This means the attack is not fully remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious IFF file.
- The attacker must deliver the file to the victim.
- The attacker needs the victim to open the malicious IFF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Photoshop or Bridge.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Photoshop CC 16.1.1 (2015.1.1) and earlier versions, and Adobe Bridge CC 6.1.1 and earlier versions on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
- Patches were released by Adobe on February 9, 2016, to address this vulnerability (APSB16-03).
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Francis Provencher of COSIG.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) is available online.
