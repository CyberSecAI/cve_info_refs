Here's a breakdown of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2016-0753:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability CVE-2016-0753 affects the Active Model component in Ruby on Rails. It stems from insufficient input validation when processing model attributes. This allows attackers to potentially bypass intended validation steps by crafting specific parameters that circumvent the validation process, especially when applications don't properly filter user-supplied data before model instantiation.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because Active Model allows instance-level writers for class accessors. This means that certain model attributes, including those related to validations, could be modified during instantiation by an attacker controlling the input.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The core issue is insufficient input validation in Active Model, specifically the ability to bypass validations through manipulation of attributes during object creation.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers could use this to set attributes to invalid values or clear attributes altogether which can lead to data inconsistencies, bypass of business logic, and other security issues. The specific impact depends on how an application uses Active Model and the nature of the validations it has in place.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By sending a crafted set of parameters during object instantiation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the capability to provide arbitrary attributes to models. This may be through a web form, API, or other external sources where data is not thoroughly sanitized.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions 4.1.0 and newer of Active Model and related components (including Active Record).
*   Versions 4.0.13 and older are not vulnerable
*   The fix is available in versions 5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, and 4.1.14.1.
*   The provided information suggests that Rails users who utilize Strong Parameters are less susceptible to this issue if they have not explicitly disabled input verification. However, if the `permit!` method is used, then they may be vulnerable as well.
*   The patches are provided as git-am formatted patches.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to the patched versions.
*   Stop using the `permit!` method in Rails controllers which allows all parameters.
*   Outside of Rails, use whitelisting of parameters to filter only allowed attributes before passing data to Active Model objects (e.g., via `Hash#slice`).
*   Integrate Strong Parameters to whitelist input outside of a Rails app.
*   Utilize provided patches when upgrades are not possible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information makes it clear that Active Model is not intended to handle arbitrary user input and that it is the responsibility of the application to validate input first.
*   The Suse Bugzilla entry includes patches for 5.0, 4.2, 4.1, and 3.2 version series.
*  Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux products are also affected.
*   The original report came from John Backus from BlockScore.
