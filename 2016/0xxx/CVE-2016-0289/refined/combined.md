Please consult the [Product Coexistence Matrix](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20Maximo%20Asset%20Management/page/Product%20compatibility) for a list of supported product combinations.

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to download the appropriate Interim Fix or Fix Pack from Fix Central ([What is Fix Central?](http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/fixes/en/fixcentral/help/faq_sw.html)) and apply for each affected product as soon as possible. Please see below for information on the fixes available for each product, version, and release. Follow the installation instructions in the ‘readme’ documentation provided with each fix pack or interim fix.

**For Maximo Asset Management 7.6, 7.5:**

| **VRM** | **Fix Pack or Interim Fix** | **Download** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7.6.0 | Maximo 7.6.0.4 Fix Pack: 7.6.0.4-TIV-MAMMT-FP004 or latest Interim Fix available | [FixCentral](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/IBM+Maximo+Asset+Management&release=7.6.0.3&platform=All&function=all) |
| 7.5.0 | Maximo 7.5.0.10 Fix Pack: 7.5.0.10-TIV-MAM-FP010 or latest Interim Fix available | [FixCentral](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/IBM+Maximo+Asset+Management&release=7.5.0.9&platform=All&function=all) |

The fix for this vulnerability is implemented entirely via application XML. Upgrades to the Fix Pack versions above, or any subsequent Fix Packs or Interim Fixes, will apply these XML changes automatically. However, customers upgrading to an earlier Fix Pack, or an Interim Fix of an earlier Fix Pack, may manually apply an identical fix by following these steps:

**Instructions to Manually Apply the Fix:**

Modify Application XML for SHIPREC:

1. Go To > System Configuration > Platform Configuration > Application Designer.

2. View the SHIPREC application. Click the toolbar icon Export Application Definition.

3. Save the shiprec.xml file. Make a backup copy. Then, open shiprec.xml in a text editor.

4. Search for the text "selshipitem" to identify it in two places. In both places, make the following change:

Replace **selshipitem** with **selorditem**

5. Save shiprec.xml.

6. Still in Application Designer, click the Import Application Definition icon. Click Browse and select shiprec.xml. Click OK to close the dialog.
