Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0795:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `bugzilla.suse.com` and `www.suse.com` directly mentions CVE-2016-0795, confirming the relevance.
*   The description from `www.libreoffice.org` matches the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0795.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory `RHSA-2016:2579` explicitly mentions the fix for CVE-2016-0795.
*  The Debian Security Advisory `DSA-3482-1` explicitly mentions the fix for CVE-2016-0795.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Lotus Word Pro (lwp) document parser in LibreOffice. Specifically, an insufficient check on the validity of the LwpTocSuperLayout record leads to memory corruption issues.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow**:  The content indicates that the vulnerability is due to the improper handling of a specific record (LwpTocSuperLayout) within the LWP document format, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** By providing a crafted LWP document, an attacker can cause LibreOffice to crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** There is a possibility of executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the file, though the confirmation of that is uncertain.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Parsing:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious LWP document that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must trick the user into opening the malicious LWP document, likely via email or a malicious website download.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting malicious document**: Ability to create specially crafted LWP document that exploits the vulnerable parser is required for successful exploitation.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering to trick a user into opening the document. No special network access is required.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Software**: LibreOffice versions prior to 5.0.5 are vulnerable.
*   **Fix**: Upgrade to LibreOffice >= 5.0.5 or >= 5.1.0.
*   **Red Hat's Severity**: Red Hat Product Security rated the impact of this vulnerability as **Moderate.**
*  **SUSE's Severity:** SUSE also rated the impact of this vulnerability as **moderate**.
*   **CVSS Scores:** The content includes both CVSS v2 and v3 scores from NVD. NVD gives a base score of 9.3 (v2) and 7.8 (v3) while SUSE assigns a base score of 4.3 (v2) which could mean they have some built in mitigations.
*  The Red Hat advisory states that "All running instances of LibreOffice applications must be restarted for this update to take effect."
*  The Debian advisory states that ""The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
  was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
  that source package".

The Suse Bugzilla entries indicate that both this CVE and CVE-2016-0794 were addressed together in patches, however the CVE ID is for this vulnerability alone.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in LibreOffice's LWP parser, identified as CVE-2016-0795, allows for memory corruption that can lead to denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution if a user opens a malicious file.  The vulnerability is fixed in later LibreOffice versions, and several vendors provided patches for their distributions.

The content provides more information than what would normally be found in a CVE description, giving details on the specific code area, how it's fixed, and even some downstream impacts for various Linux distributions.
