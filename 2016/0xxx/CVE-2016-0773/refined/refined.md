Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-0773:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the regular expression (regex) parsing logic of PostgreSQL. Specifically, the code allowed users to pass in expressions containing out-of-range Unicode characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Unicode Characters:** The regex parser did not correctly handle out-of-range Unicode characters, which could lead to a crash.
- **Infinite Loop or Buffer Overflow:**  The use of very large character ranges in bracket expressions within the regex could cause an infinite loop in some cases, and a memory overwrite in other cases. The memory overwrite is specifically caused by an integer overflow when calculating the necessary memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack could trigger a backend crash, effectively causing a denial-of-service for the PostgreSQL system.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution (unconfirmed):** There was a concern about the memory overwrite leading to arbitrary code execution, though this was deemed less likely but not ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Regular Expression Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input used to generate regular expressions. This input could come from untrusted users or any other source that generates regexes based on external (user) input.
- **Network Access:** A remote attacker could trigger this vulnerability if they can provide the crafted regular expression (which could happen through a SQL query that uses regular expression functionality).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Regular Expressions:** An attacker needs to be able to pass the crafted regular expression to the PostgreSQL instance. This is most likely through a SQL query or some other functionality that uses regular expressions.
- **Network Access or User Account:** An attacker must have the ability to connect to the PostgreSQL server to issue a malicious query that would trigger the vulnerability. However, no special privileges were required beyond this.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was deemed critical for systems that generate regular expressions based on untrusted user input.
- The fix involves ensuring correct handling of large character ranges in regular expressions and fixing the integer overflow.
- Several sources indicated the need to re-index `jsonb_path_ops` indexes after patching, for PostgreSQL versions where such indexes were supported.
