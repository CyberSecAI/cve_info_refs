- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of server identity verification by IBM UrbanCode Deploy agents. Agents do not verify the identity of the server over either HTTP or JMS, allowing a compromised trusted agent to impersonate the server and send malicious work to other agents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Agents do not verify server identity over HTTP or JMS.
    - The server does not guarantee that agents receive only messages intended for them.
    - Insecure default certificate usage on the server.
    - Vulnerable plug-ins lacking server identity verification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local privileged user can exploit the vulnerability to impersonate other users and potentially obtain root privileges on other agents. A compromised agent can send work to other agents, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A local privileged user with access to a compromised agent.
    - Man-in-the-middle attacks on HTTP or JMS communication due to lack of certificate verification.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local privileged access to an IBM UrbanCode Deploy agent.
    - The ability to intercept or manipulate network traffic between agents and the server.
