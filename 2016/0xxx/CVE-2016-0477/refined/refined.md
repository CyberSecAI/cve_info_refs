Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `DownloadServlet` of Oracle Application Testing Suite. It stems from improper handling of user-supplied input in `repository`, `workspace`, or `scenario` parameters. Specifically, these parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application fails to validate user-provided input, allowing attackers to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in the `repository`, `workspace`, or `scenario` parameters.
- Information Disclosure: By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker can access and download arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Confidentiality: Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive files from the vulnerable system, leading to unauthorized disclosure of information.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP requests to the `DownloadServlet`. The request includes malicious directory traversal sequences in the `repository`, `workspace`, or `scenario` parameters, with the `downloadType` set to `scenario`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- No authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication or prior access to the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The ZDI advisory provides a good overview of the vulnerability, clearly stating the attack vector and impact.
- The Oracle CPU advisory confirms this vulnerability and the affected versions of Oracle Application Testing Suite.
- The CVSS score in the ZDI advisory is 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N), correctly reflecting a high severity vulnerability that is easily exploitable over the network with a large impact on confidentiality.
