Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-0723:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `tty_ioctl` function, specifically in `drivers/tty/tty_io.c`.
*   This race condition occurs during concurrent calls to `TIOCGETD` and `TIOCSETD` ioctl operations on a tty device.
*   The `TIOCGETD` operation directly retrieves the line discipline identifier from the `ldisc` pointer in `tty->ldisc` without waiting for the ldisc reference. This pointer can become stale when the line discipline is changed by another thread calling `TIOCSETD` or when the tty is being hung up. This leads to the use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. Specifically, the `ldisc` pointer in `tty->ldisc` may be accessed after the memory it points to has been freed, causing a crash.
*   **Race condition:** Concurrent access to tty's `ldisc` data is not properly synchronized when changing the line discipline, leading to a race condition.
*   **Potential information leak**: If an attacker controls memory layout via kernel slab creation, it's possible to read up to 4 bytes of kernel memory using crafted ioctl calls.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can trigger a use-after-free condition, leading to a system crash and DoS.
*   **Information Leak:** A local attacker may potentially expose kernel memory through crafted ioctl calls.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, the vulnerability might be abused to gain local privileges. Specifically, in combination with another vulnerability (CVE-2015-8543), it could enable local users to gain privileges using CLONE_NEWUSER support.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access**: The primary attack vector is local, as the attacker needs to be able to make `ioctl` calls on a tty device.
*   **Physical access (for some cases):** Some of the related advisories note that physical access and a malicious USB device can also be used for exploitation.
*   **Crafted BPF instructions:** It is also noted, in the context of another CVE (CVE-2016-2383) that information could be leaked by loading crafted BPF instructions after the creation of a packet filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local user**: An attacker must have the ability to execute code locally.
*   **Ability to make ioctl calls**: The attacker needs to be able to perform  `TIOCGETD` and `TIOCSETD` ioctl calls on a TTY device.
*   **Timing control**: To exploit the race condition effectively, the attacker needs some level of control over the timing of the involved threads.
*   **Specific USB Device (for some cases)**: Some advisory indicate that crafted USB device are also needed for some exploitation techniques, requiring physical proximity.
*   **Crafted Application** An attacker needs to use a crafted application to trigger the race condition.

**Additional information:**

*   The content from www.suse.com identifies affected products, and which products have already fixed the issue.
*   The content from www.ubuntu.com includes information from the corresponding Ubuntu Security Notice (USN), which includes additional CVEs fixed in the same update.
*   The fixes in the SUSE Linux Enterprise products were introduced with various patch versions, as described in the `List of released packages` table. The fixes are in multiple kernel packages with version numbers such as `4.4.21-69.1`, `4.4.73-5.1`, etc.
*   The patch described in [github.com](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5c17c861a357e9458001f021a7afa7aab9937439) resolves the race condition by waiting for a lock on the line discipline before retrieving the identifier.
*   The CVSS scores provided in the different sources vary, but all indicate a medium to high base score.
*   The description from the SUSE website indicates this issue has a "moderate" severity.
*   The Ubuntu security notice USN-2967-1 mentions that a local attacker could use this vulnerability to "cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information".
*   The openSUSE advisory mentions that this vulnerability is related to use-after-free condition and allows for obtaining sensitive information from kernel memory or causing denial of service.

In summary, CVE-2016-0723 describes a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's tty subsystem, which can be exploited locally to cause a denial of service, leak information, and possibly gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability is fixed by a patch that properly synchronizes access to the line discipline information.
