## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

USN-2968-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single

writes greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing

to certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2015-8830](/security/CVE-2015-8830))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe

buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for

[CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0774](/security/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-86-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-86.130~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-86.130~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-86-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-86.130~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-86.130~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

include/linux/poison.h: fix LIST\_POISON{1,2} offset

```
Poison pointer values should be small enough to find a room in
non-mmap'able/hardly-mmap'able space.  E.g.  on x86 "poison pointer space"
is located starting from 0x0.  Given unprivileged users cannot mmap
anything below mmap_min_addr, it should be safe to use poison pointers
lower than mmap_min_addr.

The current poison pointer values of LIST_POISON{1,2} might be too big for
mmap_min_addr values equal or less than 1 MB (common case, e.g.  Ubuntu
uses only 0x10000).  There is little point to use such a big value given
the "poison pointer space" below 1 MB is not yet exhausted.  Changing it
to a smaller value solves the problem for small mmap_min_addr setups.

The values are suggested by Solar Designer:

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic for Trusty

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single

writes greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing

to certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2015-8830](/security/CVE-2015-8830))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the [Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.

### Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.* The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
    SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
    installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
    users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
    enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
    Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
    applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
    application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
    attempt to remove any such applications.* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
      pass media to processes such as mediaserver.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe

buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for

[CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0774](/security/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](/security/CVE-2016-2069))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

                 CVE-2016-5244

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-7515, CVE-2016-2184, CVE-2016-2185, CVE-2016-2186,
CVE-2016-2187, CVE-2016-3136, CVE-2016-3137, CVE-2016-3138,
CVE-2016-3140

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that various USB
    drivers do not sufficiently validate USB descriptors.  This
    allowed a physically present user with a specially designed USB
    device to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2016-0821

    Solar Designer noted that the list 'poisoning' feature, intended
    to mitigate the effects of bugs in list manipulation in the
    kernel, used poison values within the range of virtual addresses
    that can be allocated by user processes.

CVE-2016-1237

    David Sinquin discovered that nfsd does not check permissions when
    setting ACLs, allowing users to grant themselves permissions to a
    file by setting the ACL.

CVE-2016-1583

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that the eCryptfs
    filesystem could be used together with the proc filesystem to
    cause a kernel stack overflow.  If the ecryptfs-utils package is
    installed, local users could exploit this, via the
    mount.ecryptfs_private program, for denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2117

    Justin Yackoski of Cryptonite discovered that the Atheros L2
    ethernet driver incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote
    attacker could take advantage of this flaw to obtain potentially
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2016-2143

    Marcin Koscielnicki discovered that the fork implementation in the
    Linux kernel on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four
    page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

CVE-2016-3070

    Jan Stancek of Red Hat discovered a local denial of service
    vulnerability in AIO handling.

CVE-2016-3134

    The Google Project Zero team found that the netfilter subsystem does
    not sufficiently validate filter table entries. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this for denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation. Debian disables
    unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled with the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this allows privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-3156

    Solar Designer discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux
    kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects
    properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial
    of service (networking outage) in the host OS.

CVE-2016-3157 / XSA-171

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the x86_64 (amd64) task switching
    implementation did not correctly update the I/O permission level
    when running as a Xen paravirtual (PV) guest.  In some
    configurations this would allow local users to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to escalate their privileges within the guest.

CVE-2016-3672

    Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll noted that it was possible to disable
    Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) for x86_32 (i386) programs
    by removing the stack resource limit. This made it easier for local
    users to exploit security flaws in programs that have the setuid or
    setgid flag set.

CVE-2016-3951

    It was discovered that the cdc_ncm driver would free memory
    prematurely if certain errors occurred during its initialisation.
    This allowed a physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    escalate their privileges.

CVE-2016-3955

    Ignat Korchagin reported that the usbip subsystem did not check
    the length of data received for a USB buffer.  This allowed denial
    of service (crash) or privilege escalation on a system configured
    as a usbip client, by the usbip server or by an attacker able to
    impersonate it over the network.  A system configured as a usbip
    server might be similarly vulnerable to physically present users.

CVE-2016-3961 / XSA-174

    Vitaly Kuznetsov of Red Hat discovered that Linux allowed the use of
    hugetlbfs on x86 (i386 and amd64) systems even when running as a Xen
    paravirtualised (PV) guest, although Xen does not support huge
    pages. This allowed users with access to /dev/hugepages to cause a
    denial of service (crash) in the guest.

CVE-2016-4470

    David Howells of Red Hat discovered that a local user can trigger a
    flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of key lookups in the keychain
    subsystem, leading to a denial of service (crash) or possibly to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-4482, CVE-2016-4485, CVE-2016-4486, CVE-2016-4569,
CVE-2016-4578, CVE-2016-4580, CVE-2016-5243, CVE-2016-5244

    Kangjie Lu reported that the USB devio, llc, rtnetlink, ALSA
    timer, x25, tipc, and rds facilities leaked information from the
    kernel stack.

CVE-2016-4565

    Jann Horn of Google Project Zero reported that various components
    in the InfiniBand stack implemented unusual semantics for the
    write() operation.  On a system with InfiniBand drivers loaded,
    local users could use this for denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2016-4581

    Tycho Andersen discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel
    did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local user can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2016-4805

    Baozeng Ding discovered a use-after-free in the generic PPP layer in
    the Linux kernel. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service (system crash), or potentially escalate
    their privileges.

CVE-2016-4913

    Al Viro found that the ISO9660 filesystem implementation did not
    correctly count the length of certain invalid name entries.
    Reading a directory containing such name entries would leak
    information from kernel memory.  Users permitted to mount disks or
    disk images could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2016-4997 / CVE-2016-4998

    Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that missing input sanitising
    in Netfilter socket handling may result in denial of service. Debian
    disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, if locally enabled
    with the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl, this also allows
    privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

include/linux/poison.h: fix LIST\_POISON{1,2} offsetPoison pointer values should be small enough to find a room in
non-mmap'able/hardly-mmap'able space. E.g. on x86 "poison pointer space"
is located starting from 0x0. Given unprivileged users cannot mmap
anything below mmap\_min\_addr, it should be safe to use poison pointers
lower than mmap\_min\_addr.
The current poison pointer values of LIST\_POISON{1,2} might be too big for
mmap\_min\_addr values equal or less than 1 MB (common case, e.g. Ubuntu
uses only 0x10000). There is little point to use such a big value given
the "poison pointer space" below 1 MB is not yet exhausted. Changing it
to a smaller value solves the problem for small mmap\_min\_addr setups.
The values are suggested by Solar Designer:

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-wily](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-wily) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

## Details

USN-2971-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 15.10.

This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware

Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 15.10 for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Hi,

I expect MITRE will assign a CVE ID.

"All" as in "all upstream versions that contain the feature at all
(3.0+), and likely some backports".  It appears the bug got introduced
in Vasily's forward-porting of the functionality to newer 2.6.x kernels
before it finally got merged in this thread:

<https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/13/382>

Vasily's patch against RHEL5 kernels that we still use in Owl looks
unaffected.  It has:

+               write_lock_bh(&ping_table.lock);
+               sk_del_node_init(sk);
+               sock_put(sk);

where sk_del_node_init() calls sk_node_init(), which does
"node->pprev = NULL;"  I'd like Vasily to double-check this, though.

> And the credit is to Wen Xu and wushi of KeenTeam.

Cool!  How did you find this bug?  Did/do you actively search for more
bugs with usage of these and similar kernel interfaces?  (I think
someone should!)

Do you have a reproducer (non-weaponized exploit) that you could post?

Is my understanding correct that to trigger the bug you need direct
access to a ping socket, not indirect via the ping utility (if that is
enabled at all)?  By default, access to ping sockets is disabled:

	/*
	 * Sane defaults - nobody may create ping sockets.
	 * Boot scripts should set this to distro-specific group.
	 */
	net->ipv4.ping_group_range.range[0] = make_kgid(&init_user_ns, 1);
	net->ipv4.ping_group_range.range[1] = make_kgid(&init_user_ns, 0);

and distros are supposed to enable it selectively - e.g., on Owl we
enable it for group _icmp only:

_icmp:x:111:

# Range of group IDs permitted to access non-raw (datagram) ICMP sockets.
#
# These are an Openwall extension to the Linux kernel.  Our ping(1) program is
# able to use these sockets, which enables it to start and run without
# requiring root privileges nor a capability.  Access to these sockets is
# restricted at all primarily in order to reduce direct exposure of the added
# kernel code to potential attacks.  In other words, we gain privilege
# separation due to keeping this access restricted and installing ping(1) SGID.
#
net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 111 111

and install ping as:

-rwx--s--x 1 root _icmp 34336 Aug 14  2012 /bin/ping

So there's a layer of privsep here.

I'd like us to learn something useful from this.  Maybe it's "don't add
more code to the kernel, even if it's for security" - but we knew that,
and this is why there's the layer of privsep mentioned above (to make
things no worse than before even in presence of bugs in the new code).

Are there distros that enable access to ping sockets for all users by
default?

Then, perhaps we should harden the poison pointers to be either below
typical mmap_min_addr or in an unmapped portion of kernel space?  Do I
understand correctly that, short of possible mmap_min_addr bypasses in
general (if relevant), this would mitigate the issue?

Right now, they are:

/*
 * These are non-NULL pointers that will result in page faults
 * under normal circumstances, used to verify that nobody uses
 * non-initialized list entries.
 */
#define LIST_POISON1  ((void *) 0x00100100 + POISON_POINTER_DELTA)
#define LIST_POISON2  ((void *) 0x00200200 + POISON_POINTER_DELTA)

I'd change them to e.g.:

#define LIST_POISON1  ((void *) 0x00000100 + POISON_POINTER_DELTA)
#define LIST_POISON2  ((void *) 0x00000200 + POISON_POINTER_DELTA)

where POISON_POINTER_DELTA would normally be 0 on 32-bit x86, so they'd
be below mmap_min_addr on that arch.  Meanwhile, a mitigation appears to
be to set mmap_min_addr higher than 0x00200200 (slightly over 2 MB), but
that's not great as it leaves significantly less ASCII-armored space for
libraries.

BTW, it appears that on x86_64 POISON_POINTER_DELTA is
0xdead000000000000 by default, which I guess would hit an unmapped page
even with the current LIST_POISON2 value?  If so, is the bug at worst a
kernel Oops on x86_64 unless someone changed POISON_POINTER_DELTA in
their build?

config ILLEGAL_POINTER_VALUE
	hex
	default 0 if X86_32
	default 0xdead000000000000 if X86_64

Regardless, as a supporter of that kernel patch, I am embarrassed!

Thanks,

Alexander

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical

access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2184](/security/CVE-2016-2184))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2185](/security/CVE-2016-2185))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with

physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2016-2186](/security/CVE-2016-2186))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2188](/security/CVE-2016-2188))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not

validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3138](/security/CVE-2016-3138))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a

guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in

the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](/security/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-

switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use

this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](/security/CVE-2016-3157))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1029-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1029.37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1029.37)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
