{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel's list poison feature did not take into account the mmap_min_addr value.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "The kernel's list poison feature used poison values within the range of virtual addresses that can be allocated by user processes."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could use this to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with ability to exploit other kernel vulnerabilities."
