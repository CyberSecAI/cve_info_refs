- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Security Guardium transmits sensitive data in cleartext within the query of a request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques could intercept and obtain the sensitive information transmitted in cleartext.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, specifically a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be positioned on the network path between the client and the server to intercept the communication.
