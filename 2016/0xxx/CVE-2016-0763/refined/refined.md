{
  "CVE-2016-0763": {
    "Description": "The setGlobalContext method in org/apache/naming/factory/ResourceLinkFactory.java in Apache Tomcat did not consider whether ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext callers are authorized, which allowed remote authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and read or write to arbitrary application data, or cause a denial of service (application disruption), via a web application that sets a crafted global context.",
    "Root cause": "The setGlobalContext method in ResourceLinkFactory did not check for caller authorization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authorization",
      "SecurityManager bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers could read or write arbitrary application data or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A crafted web application sets a malicious global context"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Remote, authenticated user is required."
  }
