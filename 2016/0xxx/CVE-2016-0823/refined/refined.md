Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0823:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly mentions CVE-2016-0823 as an "Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Kernel" within the "Nexus Security Bulletin - March 2016" document. The commit message from github also explicitly references it as the fix for this vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the kernel leaking physical addresses to unprivileged userspace via `/proc/PID/pagemap`. The `/proc/PID/pagemap` interface allows processes to read page table information including physical addresses of the mapped memory. The commit message from git.kernel.org highlights that the sensitive information exposed through pagemap can be abused for attacks (referring to the Project Zero blog post on the Rowhammer exploit).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:**  The primary weakness is the exposure of physical memory addresses which is not intended to be revealed to unprivileged processes. This bypasses security measures in place and can enable attackers to exploit the platform further.
-   **Privilege Escalation Enabler**: Though it is not an elevation of privilege vulnerability directly, the leaked information can be used as part of an exploit chain to escalate privileges, as referenced in the Google Project Zero writeup describing the Rowhammer exploit. This vulnerability could be combined with another kernel vulnerability that allows memory manipulation, to escalate privilege to the kernel.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
The primary impact is information disclosure, which could lead to:

*   **Bypass of security measures:** The leak bypasses kernel level security mechanism like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) by revealing the actual memory locations.
*   **Exploit facilitation:** Attackers could leverage leaked physical addresses to develop exploits. For example, knowing the exact location of page tables makes bit-flipping attacks such as Rowhammer exploits easier to execute.
*   **Potential for Remote Exploitation**: While not direct, the information leak could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve remote code execution or compromise the system in other ways.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   -   Local access to the target device.
   -   The vulnerability is accessed via the `/proc/PID/pagemap` interface, which is available to processes running on the system.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system. They don't need root privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Access to `/proc`:** The attacker needs access to the `/proc` filesystem to access the `/proc/PID/pagemap` interface.

**7. Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented disallows anyone without CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability from accessing `/proc/PID/pagemap`.
- The Google Project Zero blog post details how the information disclosure is used in a practical exploit to gain kernel privileges by exploiting DRAM rowhammer effects.
- The patch for this issue is not in AOSP and is part of the binary driver update available from Google Developer site.

In summary, CVE-2016-0823 is an information disclosure vulnerability that can expose physical memory addresses and make the Android platform more vulnerable to other attacks. The fix is to restrict access to the `/proc/PID/pagemap` to privileged processes only.
