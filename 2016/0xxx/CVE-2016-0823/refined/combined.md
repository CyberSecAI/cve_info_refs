# Nexus Security Bulletin - March 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published March 07, 2016 | Updated March 08, 2016*

We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the
[Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images).
Builds LMY49H or later and Android M with Security Patch Level of March 01, 2016 or later
address these issues. Refer to the
[Nexus documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705)
for instructions on how to check the security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on February
1, 2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have been
released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the [Mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.

### Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
  in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
  the latest version of Android where possible.* The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
    SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
    installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
    users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
    enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
    Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
    applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
    application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
    attempt to remove any such applications.* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
      pass media to processes such as mediaserver.

### Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Mediaserver

During media file and data processing of a specially crafted file,
vulnerabilities in mediaserver could allow an attacker to cause memory
corruption and remote code execution as the mediaserver process.

The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system,
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.

This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote
code execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver
service has access to audio and video streams as well as access to privileges
that third-party apps could not normally access.

latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the
[Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

### Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in Kernel Keyring Component

An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Kernel Keyring Component could
enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the
kernel. This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of a
local permanent device compromise and the device could potentially only be
repaired by re-flashing the operating system. However, in Android versions 5.0
and above, SELinux rules prevents third-party applications from reaching the
affected code.

As pointed by recent post[1] on exploiting DRAM physical imperfection,
/proc/PID/pagemap exposes sensitive information which can be used to do
attacks.

This disallows anybody without CAP_SYS_ADMIN to read the pagemap.

### Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer bug to gain kernel privileges

Rowhammer blog post (draft)

Posted by Mark Seaborn, sandbox builder and breaker, with contributions by Thomas Dullien, reverse engineer

*[This guest post continues Project Zero’s practice of promoting excellence in security research on the Project Zero blog]*

# Overview

“Rowhammer” is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows. We tested a selection of laptops and found that a subset of them exhibited the problem. We built two working privilege escalation exploits that use this effect. One exploit uses rowhammer-induced bit flips to gain kernel privileges on x86-64 Linux when run as an unprivileged userland process. When run on a machine vulnerable to the rowhammer problem, the process was able to induce bit flips in page table entries (PTEs). It was able to use this to gain write access to its own page table, and hence gain read-write access to all of physical memory.

We don’t know for sure how many machines are vulnerable to this attack, or how many existing vulnerable machines are fixable. Our exploit uses the x86 CLFLUSH instruction to generate many accesses to the underlying DRAM, but other techniques might work on non-x86 systems too.

We expect our PTE-based exploit could be made to work on other operating systems; it is not inherently Linux-specific. Causing bit flips in PTEs is just one avenue of exploitation; other avenues for exploiting bit flips can be practical too. Our other exploit demonstrates this by escaping from the Native Client sandbox.

# Introduction to the rowhammer problem

We learned about the rowhammer problem from Yoongu Kim et al’s paper, “[Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them: An Experimental Study of DRAM Disturbance Errors](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf)” (Yoongu Kim, Ross Daly, Jeremie Kim, Chris Fallin, Ji Hye Lee, Donghyuk Lee, Chris Wilkerson, Konrad Lai, Onur Mutlu).

They demonstrate that, by repeatedly accessing two “aggressor” memory locations within the process’s virtual address space, they can cause bit flips in a third, “victim” location. The victim location is potentially outside the virtual address space of the process — it is in a different DRAM row from the aggressor locations, and hence in a different 4k page (since rows are larger than 4k in modern systems).

This works because DRAM cells have been getting smaller and closer together. As DRAM manufacturing scales down chip features to smaller physical dimensions, to fit more memory capacity onto a chip, it has become harder to prevent DRAM cells from interacting electrically with each other. As a result, accessing one location in memory can disturb neighbouring locations, causing charge to leak into or out of neighbouring cells. With enough accesses, this can change a cell’s value from 1 to 0 or vice versa.

The paper explains that this tiny snippet of code can cause bit flips:

```
code1a:
  mov (X), %eax  // Read from address X
  mov (Y), %ebx  // Read from address Y
  clflush (X)  // Flush cache for address X
  clflush (Y)  // Flush cache for address Y
  jmp code1a
```

Two ingredients are required for this routine to cause bit flips:

* **Address selection:** For code1a to cause bit flips, addresses X and Y must map to different rows of DRAM in the same bank.

  Some background: Each DRAM chip contains many rows of cells. Accessing a byte in memory involves transferring data from the row into the chip’s “row buffer” (discharging the row’s cells in the process), reading or writing the row buffer’s contents, and then copying the row buffer’s contents back to the original row’s cells (recharging the cells).

  It is this process of “activating” a row (discharging and recharging it) that can disturb adjacent rows. If this is done enough times, in between automatic refreshes of the adjacent rows (which usually occur every 64ms), this can cause bit flips in the adjacent rows.

  The row buffer acts as a cache, so if addresses X and Y point to the same row, then code1a will just read from the row buffer without activating the row repeatedly.

  Furthermore, each bank of DRAM has its own notion of a “currently activated row”. So if addresses X and Y point to different banks, code1a will just read from those banks’ row buffers without activating rows repeatedly. (Banks are groups of DRAM chips whose rows are activated in lockstep.)

  However, if X and Y point to different rows in the same bank, code1a will cause X and Y’s rows to be repeatedly activated. This is termed “row hammering”.
* **Bypassing the cache:** Without code1a’s CLFLUSH instructions, the memory reads (MOVs) will be served from the CPU’s cache. Flushing the cache using CLFLUSH forces the memory accesses to be sent to the underlying DRAM, which is necessary to cause the rows to be repeatedly activated.

  Note that the paper’s version of code1a also includes an MFENCE instruction. However, we found that using MFENCE was unnecessary and actually reduced the number of bit flips we saw. Yoongu Kim’s modified memtest also omits the MFENCE from its row hammering code.

# Refining the selection of addresses to hammer

### Using the physical address mapping

How can we pick pairs of addresses that satisfy the “different row, same bank” requirements?

One possibility is to use knowledge of how the CPU’s memory controller maps physical addresses to DRAM’s row, column and bank numbers, along with knowledge of either:

* The absolute physical addresses of memory we have access to. Linux allows this via /proc/*PID*/pagemap.
* The relative physical addresses of memory we have access to. Linux can allow this via its support for “huge pages”, which cover 2MB of contiguous physical address space per page. Whereas a normal 4k page is smaller than a typical DRAM row, a 2MB page will typically cover multiple rows, some of which will be in the same bank.

Yoongu Kim et al take this approach. They pick Y = X + 8MByte based on knowledge of the physical address mapping used by the memory controllers in Intel and AMD’s CPUs.

### Random address selection

The CPU’s physical address mapping can be difficult to determine, though, and features such as /proc/*PID*/pagemap and huge pages are not available everywhere. Furthermore, if our guesses about the address mapping are wrong, we might pick an offset that pessimises our chances of successful row hammering. (For example, Y = X + 8 kByte might always give addresses in different banks.)

A simpler approach is to pick address pairs at random. We allocate a large block of memory (e.g. 1GB) and then pick random virtual addresses within that block. On a machine with 16 DRAM banks (as one of our test machines has: 2 DIMMs with 8 banks per DIMM), this gives us a 1/16 chance that the chosen addresses are in the same bank, which is quite high. (The chance of picking two addresses in the same row is negligible.)

Furthermore, we can increase our chances of successful row hammering by modifying code1a to hammer more addresses per loop iteration. We find we can hammer 4 or 8 addresses without slowing down the time per iteration.

### Selecting addresses using timing

Another way to determine whether a pair of addresses has the “different row, same bank” property would be to time uncached accesses to those addresses using a fine-grained timer such as the RDTSC instruction. The access time will be slower for pairs that satisfy this property than those that don’t.

### Double-sided hammering

We have found that we can increase the chances of getting bit flips in row N by row-hammering both of its neighbours (rows N-1 and N+1), rather than by hammering one neighbour and a more-distant row. We dub this “double-sided hammering”.

For many machines, double-sided hammering is the only way of producing bit flips in reasonable time. For machines where random selection is already sufficient to cause bit flips, double-sided hammering can lead to a vastly increased number of bits flipped. We have observed 25+ bits flipped in one row on one particularly fragile machine.

Performing double-sided hammering is made more complicated by the underlying memory geometry. It requires the attacker to know or guess what the offset will be, in physical address space, between two rows that are in the same bank *and* are adjacent. Let’s call this the “row offset”.

From our testing, we were able to naively extrapolate that the row offset for laptop Model #4 (see the table below) is 256k. We did this by observing the likelihood of bit flips relative to the distance the selected physical memory pages had from the victim page. This likelihood was maximized when we hammered the locations 256k below and above a given target row.

This “256k target memory area, 256k victim memory area, 256k target memory area” setup has shown itself to be quite effective on other laptops by the same vendor. It is likely that this setup needs to be tweaked for other vendors.

This 256k row offset could probably be explained as being a product of the row size (number of columns), number of banks, number of channels, etc., of the DRAM in this machine, though this requires further knowledge of how the hardware maps physical addresses to row and bank numbers.

Doing double-sided hammering does require that we can pick physically-contiguous pages (e.g. via /proc/*PID*/pagemap or huge pages).

# Exploiting rowhammer bit flips

Yoongu Kim et al say that “With some engineering effort, we believe we can develop Code 1a into a disturbance attack that … hijacks control of the system”, but say that they leave this research task for the future. We took on this task!

We found various machines that exhibit bit flips (see the experimental results below). Having done that, we wrote two exploits:

* [The first](https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=284) runs as a [Native Client](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client) (NaCl) program and escalates privilege to escape from NaCl’s x86-64 sandbox, acquiring the ability to call the host OS’s syscalls directly. We have mitigated this by changing NaCl to disallow the CLFLUSH instruction. (I picked NaCl as the first exploit target because I work on NaCl and have written proof-of-concept NaCl sandbox escapes before.)
* [The second](https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=283) runs as a normal x86-64 process on Linux and escalates privilege to gain access to all of physical memory. This is harder to mitigate on existing machines.

### NaCl sandbox escape

Native Client is a sandboxing system that allows running a subset of x86-64 machine code (among other architectures) inside a sandbox. Before running an x86-64 executable, NaCl uses a validator to check that its code conforms to [a subset of x86 instructions that NaCl deems to be safe](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/reference/sandbox_internals/x86-64-sandbox#x86-64-sandbox).

However, NaCl assumes that the hardware behaves correctly. It assumes that memory locations don’t change without being written to! NaCl’s approach of validating machine code is particularly vulnerable to bit flips, because:

* A bit flip in validated code can turn a safe instruction sequence into an unsafe one.
* Under NaCl, the sandboxed program’s code segment is readable by the program. This means the program can check whether a bit flip has occurred and determine whether or how it can exploit the change.

Our exploit targets NaCl’s instruction sequence for sandboxed indirect jumps, which looks like this:

```
  andl $~31, %eax  // Truncate address to 32 bits and mask to be 32-byte-aligned.
  addq %r15, %rax  // Add %r15, the sandbox base address.
  jmp *%rax  // Indirect jump.
```

The exploit works by triggering bit flips in that code sequence. It knows how to exploit 13% of the possible bit flips. Currently it only handles bit flips that modify register numbers. (With more work, it could handle more exploitable cases, such as opcode changes.) For example, if a bit flip occurs in bit 0 of the register number in “jmp \*%rax”, this morphs to “jmp \*%rcx”, which is easily exploitable — since %rcx is unconstrained, this allows jumping to any address. Normally NaCl only allows indirect jumps to 32-byte-aligned addresses (and it ensures that instructions do not cross 32-byte bundle boundaries). Once a program can jump to an unaligned address, it can escape the sandbox, because it is possible to hide unsafe x86 instructions inside safe ones. For example:

```
  20ea0:       48 b8 0f 05 eb 0c f4 f4 f4 f4    movabs $0xf4f4f4f40ceb050f,%rax
```

This hides a SYSCALL instruction (0f 05) at address 0x20ea2.

Our NaCl exploit does the following:

* It fills the sandbox’s dynamic code area with 250MB of NaClized indirect jump instruction sequences using NaCl’s dyncode\_create() API.
* In a loop:
  + It row-hammers the dynamic code area using CLFLUSH, picking random pairs of addresses.
  + It searches the dynamic code area for bit flips. If it sees an exploitable bit flip, it uses it to jump to shell code hidden inside NaCl-validated instructions. Otherwise, if the bit flip isn’t exploitable, it continues.

We have mitigated this by changing NaCl’s x86 validator to disallow the CLFLUSH instruction (tracked by CVE-2015-0565). However, there might be other ways to cause row hammering besides CLFLUSH (see below).

Prior to disallowing CLFLUSH in NaCl, it may have been possible to chain this NaCl exploit together with the kernel privilege escalation below so that a NaCl app in the Chrome Web Store app could gain kernel privileges, using just one underlying hardware bug for the whole chain. To our knowledge there was no such app in the Chrome Web Store. PNaCl — which is available on the open web — has an extra layer of protection because an attacker would have had to find an exploit in the PNaCl translator before being able to emit a CLFLUSH instruction.

### Kernel privilege escalation

Our kernel privilege escalation works by using row hammering to induce a bit flip in a page table entry (PTE) that causes the PTE to point to a physical page containing a page table of the attacking process. This gives the attacking process read-write access to one of its own page tables, and hence to all of physical memory.

There are two things that help ensure that the bit flip has a high probability of being exploitable:

1. Rowhammer-induced bit flips tend to be repeatable. This means we can tell in advance if a DRAM cell tends to flip and whether this bit location will be useful for the exploit.

   For example, bit 51 in a 64-bit word is the top bit of the physical page number in a PTE on x86-64. If this changes from 0 to 1, that will produce a page number that's bigger than the system's physical memory, which isn't useful for our exploit, so we can skip trying to use this bit flip. However, bit 12 is the bottom bit of the PTE's physical page number. If that changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, the PTE will still point to a valid physical page.
2. We spray most of physical memory with page tables. This means that when a PTE's physical page number changes, there's a high probability that it will point to a page table for our process.

   We do this spraying by mmap()ing the same file repeatedly. This can be done quite quickly: filling 3GB of memory with page tables takes about 3 seconds on our test machine.

There are two caveats:

* Our exploit runs in a normal Linux process. More work may be required for this to work inside a sandboxed Linux process (such as a Chromium renderer process).
* We tested on a machine with low memory pressure. Making this work on a heavily-loaded machine may involve further work.

#### Break it down: exploit steps

The first step is to search for aggressor/victim addresses that produce useful bit flips:

* mmap() a large block of memory.
* Search this block for aggressor/victim addresses by row-hammering random address pairs. Alternatively, we can use aggressor/victim physical addresses that were discovered and recorded on a previous run; we use /proc/self/pagemap to search for these in memory.
* If we find aggressor/victim addresses where the bit flipped within the 64-bit word isn’t useful for the exploit, just skip that address set.
* Otherwise, munmap() all but the aggressor and victim pages and begin the exploit attempt.

In preparation for spraying page tables, we create a file in /dev/shm (a shared memory segment) that we will mmap() repeatedly. (See later for how we determine its size.) We write a marker value at the start of each 4k page in the file so that we can easily identify these pages later, when checking for PTE changes.

Note that we don’t want these data pages to be allocated from sequential physical addresses, because then flips in the lower bits of physical page numbers would tend to be unexploitable: A PTE pointing to one data page would likely change to pointing to another data page.

To avoid that problem, we first deliberately fragment physical memory so that the kernel’s allocations from physical memory are randomised:

* mmap() (with MAP\_POPULATE) a block of memory that’s a large fraction of the machine’s physical memory size.
* Later, whenever we do something that will cause the kernel to allocate a 4k page (such as a page table), we release a page from this block using madvise() + MADV\_DONTNEED.

We are now ready to spray memory with page tables. To do this, we mmap() the data file repeatedly:

* We want each mapping to be at a 2MB-aligned virtual address, since each 4k page table covers a 2MB region of virtual address space. We use MAP\_FIXED for this.
* We cause the kernel to populate some of the PTEs by accessing their corresponding pages. We only need to populate one PTE per page table: We know our bit flip hits the Nth PTE in a page table, so, for speed, we only fault in the Nth 4k page in each 2MB chunk.
* Linux imposes a limit of about 2^16 on the number of VMAs (mmap()’d regions) a process can have. This means that our /dev/shm data file must be large enough such that, when mapped 2^16 times, the mappings create enough page tables to fill most of physical memory. At the same time, we want to keep the data file as small as possible so as not to waste memory that could instead be filled with page tables. We pick its size accordingly.
* In the middle of this, we munmap() the victim page. With a high probability, the kernel will reuse this physical page as a page table. We can’t touch this page directly any more, but we can potentially modify it via row hammering.

Having finished spraying, it’s hammer time. We hammer the aggressor addresses. Hopefully this induces the bit flip in the victim page. We can’t observe the bit flip directly (unlike in the NaCl exploit).

Now we can check whether PTEs changed exploitably. We scan the large region we mapped to see whether any of the PTEs now point to pages other than our data file. Again, for speed, we only need to check the Nth page within each 2MB chunk. We can check for the marker value we wrote earlier. If we find no marker mismatches, our attempt failed (and we could retry).

If we find a marker mismatch, then we have gained illicit access to a physical page. Hopefully this is one of the page tables for our address space. If we want to be careful, we can verify whether this page looks like one of our page tables. The Nth 64-bit field should look like a PTE (certain bits will be set or unset) and the rest should be zero. If not, our attempt failed (and we could retry).

At this point, we have write access to a page table, probably our own. However, we don’t yet know which virtual address this is the page table for. We can determine that as follows:

* Write a PTE to the page (e.g. pointing to physical page 0).
* Do a second scan of address space to find a second virtual page that now points to somewhere other than our data file. If we don’t find it, our attempt failed (and we could retry).

#### Exploiting write access to page tables

We now have write access to one of our process’s page tables. By modifying the page table, we can get access to any page in physical memory. We now have many options for how to exploit that, varying in portability, convenience and speed. The portable options work without requiring knowledge of kernel data structures. Faster options work in O(1) time, whereas slower options might require scanning all of physical memory to locate a data structure.

Some options are:

* Currently implemented option: Modify a SUID-root executable such as /bin/ping, overwriting its entry point with our shell code, and then run it. Our shell code will then run as root. This approach is fast and portable, but it does require access to /proc/*PID*/pagemap: We load /bin/ping (using open() and mmap()+MAP\_POPULATE) and query which physical pages it was loaded into using /proc/self/pagemap.
* A similar approach is to modify a library that a SUID executable uses, such as /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. (On some systems, SUID executables such as /bin/ping can’t be open()’d because their permissions have been locked down.)
* Other, less portable approaches are to modify kernel code or kernel data structures.
  + We could modify our process’s UID field. This would require locating the “struct cred” for the current process and knowing its layout.
  + We could modify the kernel’s syscall handling code. We can quickly determine its physical address using the SIDT instruction, which is exposed to unprivileged code.

# Routes for causing row hammering

Our proof-of-concept exploits use the x86 CLFLUSH instruction, because it’s the easiest way to force memory accesses to be sent to the underlying DRAM and thus cause row hammering.

The fact that CLFLUSH is usable from unprivileged code is surprising, because the number of legitimate uses for it outside of a kernel or device driver is probably very small. For comparison, ARM doesn’t have an unprivileged cache-flush instruction. (ARM Linux does have a cacheflush() syscall, used by JITs, for synchronising instruction and data caches. On x86, the i-cache and d-cache are synchronised automatically, so CLFLUSH isn’t needed for this purpose.)

We have changed NaCl’s x86 validator to disallow CLFLUSH. Unfortunately, kernels can’t disable CLFLUSH for normal userland code. Currently, CLFLUSH can’t be intercepted or disabled, even using VMX (x86 virtualisation). (For example, RDTSC can be intercepted without VMX support. VMX allows intercepting more instructions, including WBINVD and CPUID, but not CLFLUSH.) There might be a case for changing the x86 architecture to allow CLFLUSH to be intercepted. From a security engineering point of view, removing unnecessary attack surface is good practice.

However, there might be ways of causing row hammering without CLFLUSH, which might work on non-x86 architectures too:

* **Normal memory accesses:** Is it possible that normal memory accesses, in sufficient quantity or in the right pattern, can trigger enough cache misses to cause rowhammer-induced bit flips? This would require generating cache misses at every cache level (L1, L2, L3, etc.). Whether this is feasible could depend on the associativity of these caches.

  If this is possible, it would be a serious problem, because it might be possible to generate bit flips from JavaScript code on the open web, perhaps via JavaScript typed arrays.
* **Non-temporal memory accesses:** On x86, these include non-temporal stores (MOVNTI, MOVNTQ, MOVNTDQ(A), MOVNTPD, MOVNTSD and MOVNTSS) and non-temporals reads (via prefetches — PREFETCHNTA).
* **Atomic memory accesses:** Some reports claim that non-malicious use of spinlocks can cause row hammering, although the reports have insufficient detail and we’ve not been able to verify this. (See “[The Known Failure Mechanism in DDR3 memory called ‘Row Hammer’](http://www.futureplus.com/images/FS2800/The%20Known%20Failure%20Mechanism%20in%20DDR3%20memory%20called%20Row%20Hammer.pdf)”, Barbara Aichinger.) This seems unlikely on a multi-core system where cores share the highest-level cache. However, it might be possible on multi-socket systems where some pairs of cores don’t share any cache.
* **Misaligned atomic memory accesses:** x86 CPUs guarantee that instructions with a LOCK prefix access memory atomically, even if the address being accessed is misaligned, and even if it crosses a cache line boundary. (See section 8.1.2.2, “Software Controlled Bus Locking”, in [Intel’s architecture reference](http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/325462.pdf), which says “The integrity of a bus lock is not affected by the alignment of the memory field”.) This is done for backwards compatibility. In this case, the CPU doesn’t use modern cache coherency protocols for atomicity. Instead, the CPU falls back to the older mechanism of locking the bus, and we believe it might use uncached memory accesses. (On some multi-CPU-socket NUMA machines, this locking is [implemented via the QPI protocol](http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/quickpath-interconnect-rules-of-the-rev/221600290?pgno=5) rather than via a physical #LOCK pin.)

  If misaligned atomic ops generate uncached DRAM accesses, they might be usable for row hammering.

  Initial investigation suggests that these atomic ops do bypass the cache, but that they are too slow for this to generate enough memory accesses, within a 64ms refresh period, to generate bit flips.
* **Uncached pages:** For example, Windows’ CreateFileMapping() API has a SEC\_NOCACHE flag for requesting a non-cacheable page mapping.
* **Other OS interfaces:** There might be cases in which kernels or device drivers, such as GPU drivers, do uncached memory accesses on behalf of userland code.

# Experimental results

We tested a selection of x86 laptops that were readily available to us (all with non-ECC memory) using CLFLUSH with the “random address selection” approach above. We found that a large subset of these machines exhibited rowhammer-induced bit flips. The results are shown in the table below.

The testing was done using the rowhammer-test program available here:

<https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test>

Note that:

* Our sample size was not large enough that it can be considered representative.
* A negative result (an absence of bit flips) on a given machine does not definitively mean that it is not possible for rowhammer to cause bit flips on that machine. We have not performed enough testing to determine that a given machine is not vulnerable.

As a result, we have decided to anonymize our results below.

All of the machines tested used DDR3 DRAM. It was not possible to identify the age of the DRAM in all cases.

|  | Laptop model | Laptop year | CPU family (microarchitecture) | DRAM manufacturer | Saw bit flip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Model #1 | 2010 | Family V | DRAM vendor E | yes |

| 3 | Model #2 | 2011 | Family W | DRAM vendor A | yes |
| 4 | Model #2 | 2011 | Family W | DRAM vendor E | no |
| 5 | Model #3 | 2011 | Family W | DRAM vendor A | yes |

| 28 | Model #7 | 2012 | Family W | DRAM vendor D | no |
| 29 | Model #8 | 2014 | Family Z | DRAM vendor A | no |

We also tested some desktop machines, but did not see any bit flips on those. That could be because they were all relatively high-end machines with ECC memory. The ECC could be hiding bit flips.

### Testing your own machine

Users may wish to test their own machines using the rowhammer-test tool above. If a machine produces bit flips during testing, users may wish to adjust security and trust decisions regarding the machine accordingly.

While an absence of bit flips during testing on a given machine does not automatically imply safety, it does provide some baseline assurance that causing bit flips is at least difficult on that machine.

# Mitigations

### Targeted refreshes of adjacent rows

Some schemes have been proposed for preventing rowhammer-induced bit flips by changing DRAM, memory controllers, or both.

A system could ensure that, within a given refresh period, it does not activate any given row too many times without also ensuring that neighbouring rows are refreshed. Yoongu Kim et al discuss this in their paper. They refer to proposals “to maintain an array of counters” (either in the memory controller or in DRAM) for counting activations. The paper proposes an alternative, probabilistic scheme called “PARA”, which is stateless and thus does not require maintaining counters.

There are signs that some newer hardware implements mitigations:

* JEDEC’s recently-published LPDDR4 standard for DRAM (where “LP” = “Low Power”) specifies two rowhammer mitigation features that a memory controller would be expected to use. (See [JEDEC document JESD209-4](http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/results/jesd209-4) — registration is required to download specs from the JEDEC site, but it’s free.)

  + “Targeted Row Refresh” (TRR) mode, which allows the memory controller to ask the DRAM device to refresh a row’s neighbours.
  + A “Maximum Activate Count” (MAC) metadata field, which specifies how many activations a row can safely endure before its neighbours need refreshing.

  (The LPDDR4 spec does not mention “rowhammer” by name, but it does use the term “victim row”.)
* We found that at least one DRAM vendor indicates, in their public data sheets, that they implement rowhammer mitigations internally within a DRAM device, requiring no special memory controller support.

Some of the newer models of laptops that we tested did not exhibit bit flips. A possible explanation is that these laptops implement some rowhammer mitigations.

### BIOS updates and increasing refresh rates

Have hardware vendors silently rolled out any BIOS updates to mitigate the rowhammer problem by changing how the BIOS configures the CPU’s memory controller?

As an experiment, we measured the time required to cause a bit flip via double-sided hammering on one Model #4 laptop. This ran in the “less than 5 minutes” range. Then we updated the laptop’s BIOS to the latest version and re-ran the hammering test.

We initially thought this BIOS update had fixed the issue. However, after almost 40 minutes of sequentially hammering memory, some locations exhibited bit flips.

We conjecture that the BIOS update increased the DRAM refresh rate, making it harder — but not impossible — to cause enough disturbance between DRAM refresh cycles. This fits with data from Yoongu Kim et al’s paper (see Figure 4) which shows that, for some DRAM modules, a refresh period of 32ms is not short enough to reduce the error rate to zero.

We have not done a wider test of BIOS updates on other laptops.

### Monitoring for row hammering using perf counters

It might be possible to detect row hammering attempts using CPUs’ performance counters. In order to hammer an area of DRAM effectively, an attacker must generate a large number of accesses to the underlying DRAM in a short amount of time. Whether this is done using CLFLUSH or using only normal memory accesses, it will generate a large number of cache misses.

Modern CPUs provide mechanisms that allow monitoring of cache misses for purposes of performance analysis. These mechanisms can be repurposed by a defender to monitor the system for sudden bursts of cache misses, as truly cache-pessimal access patterns appear to be rare in typical laptop and desktop workloads. By measuring “time elapsed per N cache misses” and monitoring for abnormal changes, we have been able to detect aggressive hammering even on systems that were running under a heavy load (a multi-core Linux kernel compile) during the attack. Unfortunately, while detection seems possible for aggressive hammering, it is unclear what to do in response, and unclear how common false positives will be.

While it is likely that attackers can adapt their attacks to evade such monitoring, this would increase the required engineering effort, making this monitoring somewhat comparable to an intrusion detection system.

# On disclosures

The computing industry (of which Google is a part) is accustomed to security bugs in software. It has developed an understanding of the importance of public discussion and disclosure of security issues. Through these public discussions, it has developed a better understanding of when bugs have security implications. Though the industry is less accustomed to hardware bugs, hardware security can benefit from the same processes of public discussion and disclosure.

With this in mind, we can draw two lessons:

* **Exploitability of the bug:** Looking backward, had there been more public disclosures about the rowhammer problem, it might have been identified as an exploitable security issue sooner. It appears that vendors have known about rowhammer for a while, as shown by the presence of rowhammer mitigations in LPDDR4. It may be that vendors only considered rowhammer to be a reliability problem.
* **Evaluating machines:** Looking forward, the release of more technical information about rowhammer would aid evaluation of which machines are vulnerable and which are not. At the time of writing, it is difficult to tell which machines are definitely safe from rowhammer. Testing can show that a machine is vulnerable, but not that it is invulnerable.

We explore these two points in more detail below.

### On exploitability of bugs

Vendors may have considered rowhammer to be only a reliability issue, and assumed that it is too difficult to exploit. None of the public material we have seen on rowhammer (except for the paper by Yoongu Kim et al) discusses security implications.

However, many bugs that appear to be difficult to exploit have turned out to be exploitable. These bugs might initially appear to be “only” reliability issues, but are really security issues.

An extreme example of a hard-to-exploit bug is described in a recent Project Zero blog post (see “[The poisoned NUL byte, 2014 edition](http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-poisoned-nul-byte-2014-edition.html)”). This shows how an off-by-one NUL byte overwrite could be exploited to gain root privileges from a normal user account.

To many security researchers, especially those who practice writing proof-of-concept exploits, it is well known that bit flips can be exploitable. For example, a 2003 paper explains how to use random bit flips to escape from a Java VM. (See “[Using Memory Errors to Attack a Virtual Machine](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/memerr.pdf)” by Sudhakar Govindavajhala and Andrew W. Appel.)

Furthermore, as we have shown, rowhammer-induced bit flips are sometimes more easily exploitable than random bit flips, because they are repeatable.

### On vulnerability of machines

We encourage vendors to publicly release information about past, current and future devices so that security researchers, and the public at large, can evaluate them with reference to the rowhammer problem.

The following information would be helpful:

* For each model of DRAM device:

  + Is the DRAM device susceptible to rowhammer-induced bit flips at the physical level?
  + What rowhammer mitigations does the DRAM device implement? Does it implement TRR and MAC? Does it implement mitigations that require support from the memory controller, or internal mitigations that don't require this?
* For each model of CPU:

  + What mitigations does the CPU's memory controller implement? Do these mitigations require support from the DRAM devices?
  + Is there public documentation for how to program the memory controller on machine startup?
  + Is it possible to read or write the memory controller's settings after startup, to verify mitigations or enable mitigations?
  + What scheme does the memory controller use for mapping physical addresses to DRAM row, bank and column numbers? This is useful for determining which memory access patterns can cause row hammering.
* For each BIOS: What rowhammer mitigations does the BIOS enable in the CPU's memory controller settings? For example, does the BIOS enable a double refresh rate, or enable use of TRR? Is it possible to review this?

At the time of writing, we weren't able to find publicly available information on the above in most cases.

If more of this information were available, it would be easier to assess which machines are vulnerable. It would be easier to evaluate a negative test result, i.e. the absence of bit flips during testing. We could explain that a negative result for a machine is because (for example) its DRAM implements mitigations internally, or because its DRAM isn't susceptible at the physical level (because it was manufactured using an older process), or because its BIOS enables 2x refresh. Such an explanation would give us more confidence that the negative test result occurred not because our end-to-end testing was insufficient in some way, but because the machine is genuinely not vulnerable to rowhammer.

We expect researchers will be interested in evaluating the details of rowhammer mitigation algorithms. For example, does a device count row activations (as the MAC scheme suggests they should), or does it use probabilistic methods like PARA? Will the mitigations be effective against double-sided row hammering as well as single-sided hammering? Could there be any problems if both the DRAM device and memory controller independently implement their own rowhammer mitigations?

# Conclusion

We have shown two ways in which the DRAM rowhammer problem can be exploited to escalate privileges. History has shown that issues that are thought to be “only” reliability issues often have significant security implications, and the rowhammer problem is a good example of this. Many layers of software security rest on the assumption the contents of memory locations don't change unless the locations are written to.

The public discussion of software flaws and their exploitation has greatly expanded our industry’s understanding of computer security in past decades, and responsible software vendors advise users when their software is vulnerable and provide updates. Though the industry is less accustomed to hardware bugs than to software bugs, we would like to encourage hardware vendors to take the same approach: thoroughly analyse the security impact of “reliability” issues, provide explanations of impact, offer mitigation strategies and — when possible — supply firmware or BIOS updates. Such discussion will lead to more secure hardware, which will benefit all users.

* Matthew Dempsky proposed that bit flips in PTEs could be an effective route for exploiting rowhammer.
* Thomas Dullien helped with investigating how many machines are affected, came up with double-sided hammering, ran the BIOS upgrade experiment, and helped fill in the details of the PTE bit flipping exploit.

   Very impressive. What is scarier is that this problem will remain with us for years to come since it might not be possible to "patch" it

   Does the test results above make a distinction between DDR3 and DDR3L memory? It seems like that family Y and Z are completely immune to rowhammering, X is a coin-flip, and W is mostly vulnerable. It should be noted that Intel started supporting the lower voltage DDR3L as an option in Ivy Bridge machines, and then made it mandatory in Haswells and above. Could this be a factor as well?

     There's only one entry for family Z so it's probably not safe to say that it's completely immune.

     It would depend far more on the Silicon' construction techniques used by various memory builders.

     What might be an 'interesting' test would be to see if it only applies to the complete CRAP they sell into the consumer markets or if it applies to the high level quality memory used in top end servers.

     This might also be useable in 'fake' Static' rams where the actual internal array is Dram but then it attempts to look like a Static ram externally :-), by having internal refresh circuitry

     If i was running research I would run tests in this area Static ram area as well, I would suspect that it might be more susceptible.

     Rowhammer is a design defect in the memory array. It will show up in all devices in a manufacturers' process node regardless of 2/3/4/3L or LP. It cannot be screened out.

     Pseudo-SRAM could also be susceptible if they are built with a defective bitcell design.

   For testing the full memory range, outside of an operating system, there is also MemTest86 V6.0, which also implements a row hammer test.

   Impressive!!!

   This exploit technology can be definitely applied to hypervisor, and cause privilege escalation to VMX root mode.

   AMD makes available the information you've requested but were unable to find. See the aptly named BIOS and Kernel Developer's Guides, which have been publicly available for years.

   An example of from their most recent "Steamroller" cores: http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/49125\_15h\_Models\_30h-3Fh\_BKDG.pdf

   Of your requests:
   \* "What mitigations does the CPU's memory controller implement? Do these mitigations require support from the DRAM devices?"

   Do you want to know which mitigation schemes from the research paper are available? Likely few! It may not surprise you, but hardware takes a long time to change (assuredly longer than software).

   If you want to know current DRAM refresh time, see D18F2x8C on page 365 for each DRAM controller. Bits 17:16 define the hardware refresh rate. A value of 3 in this field means the refresh rate is double normal. Section 2.9.14 "DRAM On DIMM Thermal Management and Power Capping" explains that the controller may speed refresh rate because of temperature.

   \* "Is there public documentation for how to program the memory controller on machine startup?"

   Section 2.9 "DRAM Controllers (DCTs)" contains the subsection 2.9.9, "DCT/DRAM Initialization and Resume".

   \* "What scheme does the memory controller use for mapping physical addresses to DRAM row, bank and column numbers?"

   This is set per DRAM controller. See the definition for D18F2x80 on page 363. Also Section 2.9.11 for the Channel and Chip Select interleaving settings. You may also want to read the definition for D18F2x[5C:40] on pages 358-360 to see how chip select is done.

   \* "Is it possible to read or write the memory controller's settings after startup, to verify mitigations or enable mitigations?"

   Reading: Yes, MSRs and PCI configuration space values make this available to kernel mode software as shown in BKDG.

   Writing: This is harder. Many DRAM controller settings require BIOS intervention and may break in protected mode. Worth trying!

    If I understand correctly now everybody knows about the problem and the bad guys can build the special exploit software and exploit the vulnerability and we cannot do anything about it? The DRAM cannot be fixed/patched. Really?

    Hi! Is this also an issue for PPC? Look at section 11.5 here: http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/ref\_manual/E500CORERM.pdf
    Could clflush be replaced in the rowhammer-test program by one of those instructions? Which one in that case?

      DRAM suppliers agree. Everyone should buy new DRAM. I wonder if they planned this.

    The problem seems not solvable by DRAM-testing at the memory-manufacturers. Even if the testing gets intesified, DRAMs degredate and might show the issues lateron.
    DRAM memory is not like a simple switch that is either on or off. The databits are stored in leaky capacitors having a size of a few nanometers, holding a charge of less than 10 to the power of -15 coulombs (that is "femtocoulombs'!). If the charge is above a certain level, the bit is a 1 and otherwise a 0. The charge leaks out within a few milliseconds and must be refreshed by the CPU. At the same time we expect the memory cells to be able to change their content 1.6 billion times per second or more, we want billions of bits to be in a tiny little chip and it should please consume practically no power.
    DRAM memory is extremely sensitive. All the cells are connected to each other by bitlines, wordlines, address lines. If you store a pattern of bits into one corner, some of the power leaks out to other memory cells and affects them. Some cells have better isolation and can hold the data a few milliseconds longer than others. Heat, antennas, radiation, electromagnetic fields stress the memory. DRAM memory also degradates over time. That means: New DRAM memory often is failure-free for a while, but at some point of time sometimes shows a single bit-flip here or there.
    Bit-flips in DRAM do happen quite often, but they are not 'defects'! They are transient effects having many possible root-causes. Overwriting the flipped bit works and the issue is not directly reproducable. This explains why every crashed application works fine again after a Reset, simply because there is no 'permanent defect', but just a 'bit-flip effect'.
    I recommend to read this document: http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/liu-isca13.pdf
    It shows further examples of why bit-flips occur unexpectedly.

    The only good news is: ECC error correction helps to solve or at least reduce the problem.

    ECC does not only protect from hacker-attacks by row-hammering, it also improves the overall stability.

    While a PC tends to fail sometimes with freezing mousepointers, crashing programs, erratic menu-bars or even blue-screens, you won't find such issues on systems equipped with ECC. Most servers use ECC and run for years without ever having to be rebooted. Some of the High-End Cisco routers use ECC-memory and never have issues.

    For PCs and laptops, there are new memory-modules coming to the market which are built with Intelligent Memory ECC DRAMs. These are Non-ECC DIMMs and SO-DIMMs made of DRAMs that have an on-chip ECC correction (called ECC DRAM, read more here: http://www.intelligentmemory.com/fileadmin/download/PB\_IM\_ECC\_DRAM.pdf).

    The modules made of those ECC DRAMs will be called intECC-modules and are about to hit the market next week.
    Unfortunately the maximum memory capacity is limited to 2GB per module for the time being.

    The Intelligent Memory ECC DRAM chips which are used on the upcoming intECC memory modules, could also be used on many other electronic products of our daily life to make them more reliable.
    How often does your WiFi-Router, smartphone, settop box, DVR or other electronics need to be rebooted? I bet the first thing we all learn about a new device is how to restart it. Many or maybe most of these hiccups are bit-errors in the memory, which ECC protects from.

    Even HDD drives use a DRAM-memory chip for the write-buffer/cache. A bit flip in the DRAM on the HDD can cause those ugly effects of "file is corrupted and can not be opened".
    If the manufacturers would replace the conventional unprotected memory chips with those new ECC DRAMs, I am sure we'd see a new level of reliability with much less failures.

      Well, if this was the case, then why does a server with ECC - running Windows server and many complex software 24/7 for years - never fail? ECC does not help when the software is buggy, but the PC also runs Windows and less complex software, but you can hardly keep it switched on for longer than a day and still randomly have unexpected erratic behaviour sometimes.

      Rowhammer is a defect of the memory array design, not a degradation of the device, although degradation DOES happen it is not related to row hammer.

      Rowhammer is a problem because it causes corruption of multiple bits in a row. This cannot be corrected by ECC.

      the chances to corrupt multi bits in a row that are used for ECC checksum correction are quite small. Statistically this will reduce the effect by many order of magnitudes. Once you have read out the data the ECC algorithm is finding the fail and correcting it. Double bits are still detected, and also the chance to detect multibit errors is still given.
      The test will run on all DRAMs of a rank in parallel. In case of controller based ECC you might get a chance that single bit flips on multiple DRAMs will happen.
      if you use DRAM with integrated ECC as the Intelligent memory chips in combination with controller based ECC you would have double protection: one for a fail inside a DRAM and one for single bit fails over multiple DRAMs.
      ==> on DRAMs it will always come down to statistics and propability when talking about fails .. but with ECC (controller and/or DRAM based) the propability to get fails is reduced by magnitudes ..

      Hermann, I'm not sure why you mention the statistical implications. We are not discussing typical system operation where statistical behavior applies, rather a pathological worst case exploit in which you need just one key to open the door. Yes, ECC covers SECDED, but can you explain why once you go beyond 2 bit errors you claim this is not a risk?
      As I understand it RH has the potential in the worst case to corrupt all the bits in the physically adjacent row. Under this scenario what mechanisms does the system have to detect or protect against this? Once that is determined we can then delve into the statistics of the implications of partial row corruption, all the way down to 3 bits. Thanks,

      Hi mgs,
      in DRAM everything is about statistics .. Even DRAM spec up to DDR3 assumes a BER=0 (on interface and array) this is just a nice assumption but just not valid .. just DDR4 starts to take this into account. ..
      All fail mechanisms (including RowHammer) are just a matter of probaility if it fails and if the fail can be corrected or detected with any means. Getting a 3bit error is haveing a low probability and once you got it you will have a statistical probability that you are going to catch it even with SECDED. I did not mention that it is no risk, I'm just saying this is question of statistics.

      Yes, row hammer can have the potential to corrupt bits in adjacent rows (if the DRAM vendor did not a good job in either designing or testing the array).
      You don't know at which point in time a single bit error occurs, and once you do a readout with ECC you will correct it. if you wait longer you might get a double bit error and an ECC based system will stop and tell you that it run into an uncorrectable error. If you get more than 2 errors there are still chances that that the error is detected and the system stops. if you run rowhammer too long you have so many errors that you can not attack the system any more, as the code crashes completely .. so we are back in probabilities if you want to use this behavior for attacking a system. And ECC will lower the probability that you will get a fail allows the attack.
      If you combine now Chipset ECC (correcting one bit fail over 4, 8 or 16DRAM DQ width) with DRAM devices with built in ECC (correcting one fail for each DRAM burst) you are going to decrease the probability for a Fail that allows the attack even further.
      And even if a single bit fails it need to be the right bit to allow the attack ..

      Thats the reason why I think especially with ECC it's all about statistics for such a scenario ...

      The question for me is: Why this discussion on RowHammer ?

      You can get you fails in the DRAM much simpler, but maybe with less accuracy where the fail happens. Is this really less critical for security ?
      - There is no protection to change the controller registers during runtime. So adjusting the Refreshtimes is very simple. Now you can either try rowhammer on with this weakend array or just access all other WL in order to refresh these by read accesses ..
      - Maybe you want to check your SPD on the DIMMs ... is the Software Write protect really set ?
      Change write recovery times for AP and do a lot of reads to one Row. Nobody says that the critical addresspace does not share one row. So you can introduce errors along the row ..

      There are so many options to get a Fail on a DRAM .. it is just a question of statistics and probability which one leads fastest to a Fail that allows to attack a system. With ECC (on controller or on DRAM) this probaility is just lowered a lot .. but still not 0.

      It is just a given that the DRAM vendors as a whole did do a poor job designing the array. Prior to this it was assumed the DRAM were not susceptible to RH and on secure systems I'd assume the alternate attacks you mention are not possible. So in the past there was a zero risk from this. Now by introducing susceptible DRAM into a secure system the risk is non-zero and needs to be mitigated. It seems that every DRAM produced in the last 5 years has this susceptibility. That's a huge installed base at risk.

      Hi mgs, sorry to destroy your secure world ;-) ..
      RowHammer is an old issue and DRAM has never been save (at least in my understanding).. in order to get save DRAM systems people implement things like chipkill, DIMM redundancy and other fancy features .. but only to lower the risk of a fail (or attack), not to have zero risk.
      And I don't agree on DRAM vendors as ahole did a pure job. It is really a difficult task to Design a DRAM array and test it properly. How good it is done (especially the testing) is economy driven.
      If you spend enough money you can buy DRAM and Systems that lower the probaility of a fail (that can be used for an attack) to very low numbers .. but industry is not willing to spend this money (and I have to admit, that also my system is having no ECC for the 100GB of Memory installed.)
      Seems that probability of fail is still with conventional methods low enough ..

      Why do you think the methods I describe are not possible? I think they are simpler to implement than row hammer code and have more potential to get a successfull attack executed.

      I suppose you are right. The systems which are capable of being secured against the attacks you describe are built by companies who are also capable of and have already mitigated against RH.

      I used to program ATE memory test a long time ago and row hammer never failed. I think this problem emerged when the DRAM makers made a conscious decision to design an array that had less margin to this failure mode. They were assuming that statistically, during normal system operation, that RH would never occur, and they were right. Until one day a certain server CPU maker decided to allow customers to turn off caching to speed up database performance. That's when row hammer re-appeared having been dormant for nearly 30 years, and caused system crashes on ECC protected, chipkill protected, high end enterprise servers. That was several years ago. The patents didn't start to appear until after that.

    So consumer-grade gear lacking ECC protection doesn't use anything at all to detect even single-bit errors? Heck, the original IBM PC used DRAM parity.

      The IBM PC was a business machine and was built with DRAM that inherently had soft errors. Eventually soft errors were bought down to a tolerable level and parity was dropped. This row-hammer problem is a really big oops. Fortunately DRAM makers have designed it out (again) in their newer array designs.

    We have been writing about this topic for almost 9 months now. Glad Google gave us a mention. We created a feature in our DDR Detective tool to detect excessive ACTIVATE (ACT) commands to a single row address on a DIMM or SODIMM module. We have posted videos on our YouTube channel giving more information (FuturePlus Systems). If you have critical applications I highly recommend you test to see if your application creates these excessive ACT commands. Our tool is available for short term rental. Please contact us barb.aichinger@futureplus.com if you would like more information. Also check out www.DDRDetective.com/row-hammer for more information

    Amused me somewhat reading this that one of the first computers I built, back in 1979, used 4K x1 DRAM chips that ICL had rejected (and essentially thrown away) because they suffered from what they called pattern sensitivity failures... essentially the same problem as this, writing certain patterns into memory could induce changes in nearby bits if the memory timing was near the limit.

    I got some results from our own row-hammer tests performed on Non-ECC modules on different platforms using Memtest 6.0. All platforms failed the row-hammer test with different memories sooner or later.
    Every single fail was a single bit flip and there were no double-bit flips at all. The amount of single-bit-flips per each pass of the test was between 3 and 40 bit-flips and spread over multiple different addresses and different DRAMs on the modules.

    Let's say a memory module uses 8 Chips of 2Gbit capacity each = 2GByte (256Mx64).
    With 40 bit-flips in a row-hammer-test run by Memtest, this is averaging to 5 bit-flips per DRAM chip throughout a complete row-hammer test-pass. Unfortunately I do not know how often Memtest hammers the rows in one pass.

    The modules output data in 64 bit-words. There are 256 Million of such 64 Bit words in a 2GB module. By having ECC, each of these 256 million 64 bit words could have one bit-flip and ECC would still be able to correct them.
    40 bit-flips within 256 million 64 bit-words is 'peanuts' for ECC! With such small amount of bit-flips it is very unlikely that TWO of those bit-flips occur in the same 64 bit-word causing an uncorrectable double-bit error.
    This said, ECC is a very effective row-hammer protection-method.

    I doubt that TRR, MAC or increasing the refresh-rate can solve the problem. The theory is that adjacent rows survive a certain amount of row-hammers before they better should be refreshed. "Testing" if the DRAMs can take 300k hammer-cycles is not a guarantee that it will always survive 300k hammers. It could also sometimes fail after just a handful of accesses when you are unlucky. It is not the "amount of cycles" that causes the bit-flips.

    Also: Don't forget that DRAMs do degredate and get more sensitive to disturbances after some time of use. A brandnew DRAM might be surviving 300k hammers, but what if it gets a bit older?

    Besides row-hammering, DRAMs are also sensitive to heat and to radiation (from antennas or radioactivity, even natural ground-radiation). VRT-effects (variable retention time) and data-pattern-dependence (the retention time of each DRAM cell is significantly affected by the data stored in other DRAM cells) also cause bit-flips. TRR and MAC does not help against this at all.
    The only solution is to detect and correct the bit-flips -> ECC Error Correction

    Row-Hammer is a typical hacker-attack (=intentional), while all the other issues are non-intentional bit-flips. If you are unlucky, it does not even need a row-hammer software, but a simple multi-read of a row by your own software-code can cause a bit-flip in an adjacent row.

    ANY bit-flip - no matter if intentionally triggered or not - can cause a malfunction of the software/the system, or result in a crash or data corruption. Please do not only look at PCs, laptops or servers, but also think of all the other intelligent electronics out there, like networking systems, access controls, telecommunication, medical devices, automotive, industrial computers of all kinds, etc. These will typically not be row-hammered, but they still sometimes fail and need to be reset, although they are expected to always run stable.
    I think everybody had the experience that the smartphone, the settop box, the router or other electronics "needed a reset" -> this was most-likely caused by a bit-flip. While home-electronics are less critical, most industrial electronics are expected not to have such issues. Still they do.

    All bit-flips have the same root-cause -> weaknesses of memory-cells
    The best solution for ALL above mentioned issues is to have ECC

    With ECC, all applications could become a lot more stable. They would run for years without ever having to be reset/rebooted. And at the same time they will also be row-hammer-safer.

    The DRAM makers should follow the trend that Intelligent Memory started: Integrate ECC into the DRAM-chips instead of trying to find insecure workarounds only against row-hammering by MAC, TRR, faster refreshing, etc.

    Can anyone suggest the equivalent instruction of CLFLUSH for ARM Processor. The CLFLUSH is specific to x86 Processor

    How long exactly did you leave those test running to find those bit flips?

    Are we talking about in 5 minutes, hours, days?

    I am confused as to why this problem is not treated as a memory defect due to which under certain conditions when a row is accessed many times the charge is leaks between cells in different rows? this sounds like something that the dram vendor could easily screen for with a memory test algorithm during production like they already do for other memory defect behaviors. I would think of this as a bad dram part being used in the system and hence causing unexpected behavior.

pagemap: do not leak physical addresses to non-privileged userspaceAs pointed by recent post[1] on exploiting DRAM physical imperfection,
/proc/PID/pagemap exposes sensitive information which can be used to do
attacks.
This disallows anybody without CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN to read the pagemap.

drm/i915: use in\_interrupt() not in\_irq() to check context
commit 6c51d46f135b00c00373fcd029786ccef2b02b5b upstream.
The kernel in\_irq() function tests for hard-IRQ context only, so if a
system is run with the kernel 'threadirqs' option selected, the test in
intel\_check\_page\_flip() generates lots of warnings, because then it gets
called in soft-IRQ context.
We can instead use in\_interrupt() which allows for either type of
interrupt, while still detecting and complaining about misuse of the
page flip code if it is ever called from non-interrupt context.

iscsi-target: Avoid early conn\_logout\_comp for iser connections
commit f068fbc82e7696d67b1bb8189306865bedf368b6 upstream.
This patch fixes a iser specific logout bug where early complete()
of conn->conn\_logout\_comp in iscsit\_close\_connection() was causing
isert\_wait4logout() to complete too soon, triggering a use after
free NULL pointer dereference of iscsi\_conn memory.
The complete() was originally added for traditional iscsi-target
when a ISCSI\_LOGOUT\_OP failed in iscsi\_target\_rx\_opcode(), but given
iser-target does not wait in logout failure, this special case needs
to be avoided.

target: Fix virtual LUN=0 target\_configure\_device failure OOPs
commit 5f7da044f8bc1cfb21c962edf34bd5699a76e7ae upstream.
This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference triggered by a late
target\_configure\_device() -> alloc\_workqueue() failure that results
in target\_free\_device() being called with DF\_CONFIGURED already set,
which subsequently OOPses in destroy\_workqueue() code.
Currently this only happens at modprobe target\_core\_mod time when
core\_dev\_setup\_virtual\_lun0() -> target\_configure\_device() fails,
and the explicit target\_free\_device() gets called.
To address this bug originally introduced by commit 0fd97ccf45, go
ahead and move DF\_CONFIGURED to end of target\_configure\_device()
code to handle this special failure case.

ARM: dts: DRA7x: Fix the bypass clock source for dpll\_iva and others
commit d2192ea09858a8535b056fcede1a41d824e0b3d8 upstream.
Fixes: ee6c750761 (ARM: dts: dra7 clock data)
On DRA7x, For DPLL\_IVA, the ref clock(CLKINP) is connected to sys\_clk1 and
the bypass input(CLKINPULOW) is connected to iva\_dpll\_hs\_clk\_div clock.
But the bypass input is not directly routed to bypass clkout instead
both CLKINP and CLKINPULOW are connected to bypass clkout via a mux.
This mux is controlled by the bit - CM\_CLKSEL\_DPLL\_IVA[23]:DPLL\_BYP\_CLKSEL
and it's POR value is zero which selects the CLKINP as bypass clkout.
which means iva\_dpll\_hs\_clk\_div is not the bypass clock for dpll\_iva\_ck
Fix this by adding another mux clock as parent in bypass mode.
This design is common to most of the PLLs and the rest have only one bypass
clock. Below is a list of the DPLLs that need this fix:
DPLL\_IVA, DPLL\_DDR,
DPLL\_DSP, DPLL\_EVE,
DPLL\_GMAC, DPLL\_PER,
DPLL\_USB and DPLL\_CORE

We have several problems in this path:
1) There is a use-after-free when removing individual elements from

2) We have to uninit() the data part of the element from the abort
path to avoid a chain refcount leak.
3) We have to check for set->flags to see if there's a mapping, instead
of the element flags.
4) We have to check for !(flags & NFT\_SET\_ELEM\_INTERVAL\_END) to skip
elements that are part of the interval that have no data part, so
they don't need to be uninit().

netfilter: nf\_tables: fix transaction race condition
commit 8670c3a55e91cb27a4b4d4d4c4fa35b0149e1abf upstream.
A race condition exists in the rule transaction code for rules that
get added and removed within the same transaction.
The new rule starts out as inactive in the current and active in the
next generation and is inserted into the ruleset. When it is deleted,
it is additionally set to inactive in the next generation as well.
On commit the next generation is begun, then the actions are finalized.
For the new rule this would mean clearing out the inactive bit for
the previously current, now next generation.
However nft\_rule\_clear() clears out the bits for \*both\* generations,
activating the rule in the current generation, where it should be
deactivated due to being deleted. The rule will thus be active until
the deletion is finalized, removing the rule from the ruleset.
Similarly, when aborting a transaction for the same case, the undo
of insertion will remove it from the RCU protected rule list, the
deletion will clear out all bits. However until the next RCU
synchronization after all operations have been undone, the rule is
active on CPUs which can still see the rule on the list.
Generally, there may never be any modifications of the current
generations' inactive bit since this defeats the entire purpose of
atomicity. Change nft\_rule\_clear() to only touch the next generations
bit to fix this.

ipvs: fix inability to remove a mixed-family RS
commit dd3733b3e798daf778a1ec08557f388f00fdc2f6 upstream.
The current code prevents any operation with a mixed-family dest
unless IP\_VS\_CONN\_F\_TUNNEL flag is set. The problem is that it's impossible
for the client to follow this rule, because ip\_vs\_genl\_parse\_dest does
not even read the destination conn\_flags when cmd = IPVS\_CMD\_DEL\_DEST
(need\_full\_dest = 0).
Also, not every client can pass this flag when removing a dest. ipvsadm,
for example, does not support the "-i" command line option together with
the "-d" option.
This change disables any checks for mixed-family on IPVS\_CMD\_DEL\_DEST command.

powerpc/smp: Wait until secondaries are active & online
commit 875ebe940d77a41682c367ad799b4f39f128d3fa upstream.
Anton has a busy ppc64le KVM box where guests sometimes hit the infamous
"kernel BUG at kernel/smpboot.c:134!" issue during boot:
BUG\_ON(td->cpu != smp\_processor\_id());
Basically a per CPU hotplug thread scheduled on the wrong CPU. The oops
output confirms it:
CPU: 0
Comm: watchdog/130
The problem is that we aren't ensuring the CPU active bit is set for the
secondary before allowing the master to continue on. The master unparks
the secondary CPU's kthreads and the scheduler looks for a CPU to run
on. It calls select\_task\_rq() and realises the suggested CPU is not in
the cpus\_allowed mask. It then ends up in select\_fallback\_rq(), and
since the active bit isnt't set we choose some other CPU to run on.
This seems to have been introduced by 6acbfb96976f "sched: Fix hotplug
vs. set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr()", which changed from setting active before
online to setting active after online. However that was in turn fixing a
bug where other code assumed an active CPU was also online, so we can't
just revert that fix.
The simplest fix is just to spin waiting for both active & online to be
set. We already have a barrier prior to set\_cpu\_online() (which also
sets active), to ensure all other setup is completed before online &
active are set.

Because prior GCC versions always emitted NOPs on ALIGN directives, but
gcc5 started omitting them.
.LSTARTFDEDLSI1 says:
/\* HACK: The dwarf2 unwind routines will subtract 1 from the
return address to get an address in the middle of the
presumed call instruction. Since we didn't get here via
a call, we need to include the nop before the real start
to make up for it. \*/
.long .LSTART\_sigreturn-1-. /\* PC-relative start address \*/
But commit 69d0627a7f6e ("x86 vDSO: reorder vdso32 code") from 2.6.25
replaced .org \_\_kernel\_vsyscall+32,0x90 by ALIGN right before
\_\_kernel\_sigreturn.
Of course, ALIGN need not generate any NOP in there. Esp. gcc5 collapses
vclock\_gettime.o and int80.o together with no generated NOPs as "ALIGN".
So fix this by adding to that point at least a single NOP and make the
function ALIGN possibly with more NOPs then.
Kudos for reporting and diagnosing should go to Richard.

kvm: move advertising of KVM\_CAP\_IRQFD to common code
commit dc9be0fac70a2ad86e31a81372bb0bdfb6945353 upstream.
POWER supports irqfds but forgot to advertise them. Some userspace does
not check for the capability, but others check it---thus they work on
x86 and s390 but not POWER.
To avoid that other architectures in the future make the same mistake, let
common code handle KVM\_CAP\_IRQFD the same way as KVM\_CAP\_IRQFD\_RESAMPLE.

x86/fpu: Drop\_fpu() should not assume that tsk equals current
commit f4c3686386393c120710dd34df2a74183ab805fd upstream.
drop\_fpu() does clear\_used\_math() and usually this is correct
because tsk == current.
However switch\_fpu\_finish()->restore\_fpu\_checking() is called before
\_\_switch\_to() updates the "current\_task" variable. If it fails,
we will wrongly clear the PF\_USED\_MATH flag of the previous task.
So use clear\_stopped\_child\_used\_math() instead.

x86/fpu: Avoid math\_state\_restore() without used\_math() in \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig()
commit a7c80ebcac3068b1c3cb27d538d29558c30010c8 upstream.
math\_state\_restore() assumes it is called with irqs disabled,
but this is not true if the caller is \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig().
This means that if ia32\_fxstate == T and \_\_copy\_from\_user()
fails, \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig() returns with irqs disabled too.
This triggers:
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rwsem.c:41
dump\_stack
\_\_\_might\_sleep
? \_raw\_spin\_unlock\_irqrestore
\_\_might\_sleep
down\_read
? \_raw\_spin\_unlock\_irqrestore
print\_vma\_addr
signal\_fault
sys32\_rt\_sigreturn
Change \_\_restore\_xstate\_sig() to call set\_used\_math()
unconditionally. This avoids enabling and disabling interrupts
in math\_state\_restore(). If copy\_from\_user() fails, we can
simply do fpu\_finit() by hand.
[ Note: this is only the first step. math\_state\_restore() should
not check used\_math(), it should set this flag. While
init\_fpu() should simply die. ]

crypto: aesni - fix memory usage in GCM decryption
commit ccfe8c3f7e52ae83155cb038753f4c75b774ca8a upstream.
The kernel crypto API logic requires the caller to provide the
length of (ciphertext || authentication tag) as cryptlen for the
AEAD decryption operation. Thus, the cipher implementation must
calculate the size of the plaintext output itself and cannot simply use
cryptlen.
The RFC4106 GCM decryption operation tries to overwrite cryptlen memory
in req->dst. As the destination buffer for decryption only needs to hold
the plaintext memory but cryptlen references the input buffer holding
(ciphertext || authentication tag), the assumption of the destination
buffer length in RFC4106 GCM operation leads to a too large size. This
patch simply uses the already calculated plaintext size.
In addition, this patch fixes the offset calculation of the AAD buffer
pointer: as mentioned before, cryptlen already includes the size of the
tag. Thus, the tag does not need to be added. With the addition, the AAD
will be written beyond the already allocated buffer.
Note, this fixes a kernel crash that can be triggered from user space
via AF\_ALG(aead) -- simply use the libkcapi test application
from [1] and update it to use rfc4106-gcm-aes.
Using [1], the changes were tested using CAVS vectors to demonstrate
that the crypto operation still delivers the right results.

crypto: arm/aes update NEON AES module to latest OpenSSL version
commit 001eabfd54c0cbf9d7d16264ddc8cc0bee67e3ed upstream.
This updates the bit sliced AES module to the latest version in the
upstream OpenSSL repository (e620e5ae37bc). This is needed to fix a
bug in the XTS decryption path, where data chunked in a certain way
could trigger the ciphertext stealing code, which is not supposed to
be active in the kernel build (The kernel implementation of XTS only
supports round multiples of the AES block size of 16 bytes, whereas
the conformant OpenSSL implementation of XTS supports inputs of
arbitrary size by applying ciphertext stealing). This is fixed in
the upstream version by adding the missing #ifndef XTS\_CHAIN\_TWEAK
around the offending instructions.
The upstream code also contains the change applied by Russell to
build the code unconditionally, i.e., even if \_\_LINUX\_ARM\_ARCH\_\_ < 7,
but implemented slightly differently.

irqchip: armada-370-xp: Fix chained per-cpu interrupts
commit 5724be8464dceac047c1eaddaa3651cea0ec16ca upstream.
On the Cortex-A9-based Armada SoCs, the MPIC is not the primary interrupt
controller. Yet, it still has to handle some per-cpu interrupt.
To do so, it is chained with the GIC using a per-cpu interrupt. However, the
current code only call irq\_set\_chained\_handler, which is called and enable that
interrupt only on the boot CPU, which means that the parent per-CPU interrupt
is never unmasked on the secondary CPUs, preventing the per-CPU interrupt to
actually work as expected.
This was not seen until now since the only MPIC PPI users were the Marvell
timers that were not working, but not used either since the system use the ARM
TWD by default, and the ethernet controllers, that are faking there interrupts
as SPI, and don't really expect to have interrupts on the secondary cores
anyway.
Add a CPU notifier that will enable the PPI on the secondary cores when they
are brought up.

of: handle both '/' and ':' in path strings
commit 721a09e95c786346b4188863a1cfa3909c76f690 upstream.
Commit 106937e8ccdc ("of: fix handling of '/' in options for
of\_find\_node\_by\_path()") caused a regression in OF handling of
stdout-path. While it fixes some cases which have '/' after the ':', it
breaks cases where there is more than one '/' \*before\* the ':'.
For example, it breaks this boot string
stdout-path = "/rdb/serial@f040ab00:115200";
So rather than doing sequentialized checks (first for '/', then for ':';
or vice versa), to get the correct behavior we need to check for the
first occurrence of either one of them.
It so happens that the handy strcspn() helper can do just that.

Commit 054954eb051f35e74b75a566a96fe756015352c8 ("xen: switch to

During initialization of the p2m list a p2m identity area mapped by
a complete identity pmd entry has to be split up into smaller chunks
sometimes, if a non-identity pfn is introduced in this area.
If this non-identity pfn is not at index 0 of a p2m page the new
p2m page needed is initialized with wrong identity entries, as the
identity pfns don't start with the value corresponding to index 0,
but with the initial non-identity pfn. This results in weird wrong
mappings.
Correct the wrong initialization by starting with the correct pfn.

xen/events: avoid NULL pointer dereference in dom0 on large machines
commit 85e40b0539b24518c8bdf63e2605c8522377d00f upstream.
Using the pvops kernel a NULL pointer dereference was detected on a
large machine (144 processors) when booting as dom0 in
evtchn\_fifo\_unmask() during assignment of a pirq.
The event channel in question was the first to need a new entry in
event\_array[] in events\_fifo.c. Unfortunately xen\_irq\_info\_pirq\_setup()
is called with evtchn being 0 for a new pirq and the real event channel
number is assigned to the pirq only during \_\_startup\_pirq().
It is mandatory to call xen\_evtchn\_port\_setup() after assigning the
event channel number to the pirq to make sure all memory needed for the
event channel is allocated.

drivers/rtc/rtc-s3c.c: add .needs\_src\_clk to s3c6410 RTC data
commit 8792f7772f4f40ffc68bad5f28311205584b734d upstream.
Commit df9e26d093d3 ("rtc: s3c: add support for RTC of Exynos3250 SoC")
added an "rtc\_src" DT property to specify the clock used as a source to
the S3C real-time clock.
Not all SoCs needs this so commit eaf3a659086e ("drivers/rtc/rtc-s3c.c:
fix initialization failure without rtc source clock") changed to check
the struct s3c\_rtc\_data .needs\_src\_clk to conditionally grab the clock.
But that commit didn't update the data for each IP version so the RTC
broke on the boards that needs a source clock. This is the case of at
least Exynos5250 and Exynos5440 which uses the s3c6410 RTC IP block.
This commit fixes the S3C rtc on the Exynos5250 Snow and Exynos5420
Peach Pit and Pi Chromebooks.

drm/i915: add poweroff\_late handler
The problem seems to be that after the kernel puts the device into D3
the BIOS still tries to access it, or otherwise assumes that it's in D0.
This is clearly bogus, since ACPI mandates that devices are put into D3
by the OSPM if they are not wake-up sources. In the future we want to
unify more of the driver's runtime and system suspend paths, for example
by skipping all the system suspend/hibernation hooks if the device is
runtime suspended already. Accordingly for all other platforms the goal
is still to properly power down the device during hibernation.
v2:
- Another GEN4 Lenovo laptop had the same issue, while platforms from
other vendors (including mobile and desktop, GEN4 and non-GEN4) seem
to work fine. Based on this apply the workaround on all GEN4 Lenovo
platforms.
- add code comment about failing platforms (Ville)

drm: Support legacy cursor ioctls via universal planes when possible (v4)
The isn't too disastrous since fbs are small, we only create one when the
cursor bo gets changed and ultimately they'll be reaped when the window
server restarts.
Conceptually we'd want to just pass NULL for file\_priv when creating it,
but the driver needs the file to lookup the underlying buffer object for
cursor id. Instead let's move the file\_priv linking out of
add\_framebuffer\_internal() into the addfb ioctl implementation, which is
the only place it is needed. And also rename the function for a more
accurate since it only creates the fb, but doesn't add it anywhere.

This reverts commit e4df3a0b6228
("i2c: core: Dispose OF IRQ mapping at client removal time")
Calling irq\_dispose\_mapping() will destroy the mapping and disassociate
the IRQ from the IRQ chip to which it belongs. Keeping it is OK, because
existent mappings are reused properly.
Also, this commit breaks drivers using devm\* for IRQ management on
OF-based systems because devm\* cleanup happens in device code, after
bus's remove() method returns.

mm: cma: fix CMA aligned offset calculation
commit 850fc430f47aad52092deaaeb32b99f97f0e6aca upstream.
The CMA aligned offset calculation is incorrect for non-zero order\_per\_bit
values.
For example, if cma->order\_per\_bit=1, cma->base\_pfn= 0x2f800000 and
align\_order=12, the function returns a value of 0x17c00 instead of 0x400.
This patch fixes the CMA aligned offset calculation.
The previous calculation was wrong and would return too-large values for
the offset, so that when cma\_alloc looks for free pages in the bitmap with
the requested alignment > order\_per\_bit, it starts too far into the bitmap
and so CMA allocations will fail despite there actually being plenty of
free pages remaining. It will also probably have the wrong alignment.
With this change, we will get the correct offset into the bitmap.
One affected user is powerpc KVM, which has kvm\_cma->order\_per\_bit set to
KVM\_CMA\_CHUNK\_ORDER - PAGE\_SHIFT, or 18 - 12 = 6.

nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment constructor during recovery
commit 283ee1482f349d6c0c09dfb725db5880afc56813 upstream.
According to a report from Yuxuan Shui, nilfs2 in kernel 3.19 got stuck
during recovery at mount time. The code path that caused the deadlock was
as follows:
nilfs\_fill\_super()
load\_nilfs()
nilfs\_salvage\_orphan\_logs()
\* Do roll-forwarding, attach segment constructor for recovery,
and kick it.
nilfs\_segctor\_thread()
nilfs\_segctor\_thread\_construct()
\* A lock is held with nilfs\_transaction\_lock()
nilfs\_segctor\_do\_construct()
nilfs\_segctor\_drop\_written\_files()
iput()
iput\_final()
write\_inode\_now()
writeback\_single\_inode()
\_\_writeback\_single\_inode()
do\_writepages()
nilfs\_writepage()
nilfs\_construct\_dsync\_segment()
nilfs\_transaction\_lock() --> deadlock
This can happen if commit 7ef3ff2fea8b ("nilfs2: fix deadlock of segment
constructor over I\_SYNC flag") is applied and roll-forward recovery was
performed at mount time. The roll-forward recovery can happen if datasync
write is done and the file system crashes immediately after that. For
instance, we can reproduce the issue with the following steps:
< nilfs2 is mounted on /nilfs (device: /dev/sdb1) >
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test bs=4k count=1 && sync
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/nilfs/test conv=notrunc oflag=dsync bs=4k
count=1 && reboot -nfh
< the system will immediately reboot >
# mount -t nilfs2 /dev/sdb1 /nilfs
The deadlock occurs because iput() can run segment constructor through
writeback\_single\_inode() if MS\_ACTIVE flag is not set on sb->s\_flags. The
above commit changed segment constructor so that it calls iput()
asynchronously for inodes with i\_nlink == 0, but that change was
imperfect.
This fixes the another deadlock by deferring iput() in segment constructor
even for the case that mount is not finished, that is, for the case that
MS\_ACTIVE flag is not set.

regulator: core: Fix enable GPIO reference counting
commit 29d62ec5f87fbeec8413e2215ddad12e7f972e4c upstream.
Normally \_regulator\_do\_enable() isn't called on an already-enabled
rdev. That's because the main caller, \_regulator\_enable() always
calls \_regulator\_is\_enabled() and only calls \_regulator\_do\_enable() if
the rdev was not already enabled.
However, there is one caller of \_regulator\_do\_enable() that doesn't
check: regulator\_suspend\_finish(). While we might want to make
regulator\_suspend\_finish() behave more like \_regulator\_enable(), it's
probably also a good idea to make \_regulator\_do\_enable() robust if it
is called on an already enabled rdev.
At the moment, \_regulator\_do\_enable() is \_not\_ robust for already
enabled rdevs if we're using an ena\_pin. Each time
\_regulator\_do\_enable() is called for an rdev using an ena\_pin the
reference count of the ena\_pin is incremented even if the rdev was
already enabled. This is not as intended because the ena\_pin is for
something else: for keeping track of how many active rdevs there are
sharing the same ena\_pin.
Here's how the reference counting works here:
\* Each time \_regulator\_enable() is called we increment
rdev->use\_count, so \_regulator\_enable() calls need to be balanced
with \_regulator\_disable() calls.
\* There is no explicit reference counting in \_regulator\_do\_enable()
which is normally just a warapper around rdev->desc->ops->enable()
with code for supporting delays. It's not expected that the
"ops->enable()" call do reference counting.
\* Since regulator\_ena\_gpio\_ctrl() does have reference counting
(handling the sharing of the pin amongst multiple rdevs), we
shouldn't call it if the current rdev is already enabled.
Note that as part of this we cleanup (remove) the initting of
ena\_gpio\_state in regulator\_register(). In \_regulator\_do\_enable(),
\_regulator\_do\_disable() and \_regulator\_is\_enabled() is is clear that
ena\_gpio\_state should be the state of whether this particular rdev has
requested the GPIO be enabled. regulator\_register() was initting it
as the actual state of the pin.

regulator: Only enable disabled regulators on resume
commit 0548bf4f5ad6fc3bd93c4940fa48078b34609682 upstream.
The \_regulator\_do\_enable() call ought to be a no-op when called on an
already-enabled regulator. However, as an optimization
\_regulator\_enable() doesn't call \_regulator\_do\_enable() on an already
enabled regulator. That means we never test the case of calling
\_regulator\_do\_enable() during normal usage and there may be hidden
bugs or warnings. We have seen warnings issued by the tps65090 driver
and bugs when using the GPIO enable pin.
Let's match the same optimization that \_regulator\_enable() in
regulator\_suspend\_finish(). That may speed up suspend/resume and also
avoids exposing hidden bugs.

mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Fix PIO FIFO draining
commit 8dad0386b97c4bd6edd56752ca7f2e735fe5beb4 upstream.
The NDDB register holds the data that are needed by the read and write
commands.
However, during a read PIO access, the datasheet specifies that after each 32
bytes read in that register, when BCH is enabled, we have to make sure that the
RDDREQ bit is set in the NDSR register.
This fixes an issue that was seen on the Armada 385, and presumably other mvebu
SoCs, when a read on a newly erased page would end up in the driver reporting a
timeout from the NAND.

ALSA: hda - Treat stereo-to-mono mix properly
commit cc261738add93947d138d2fabad9f4dbed4e5c00 upstream.
The commit [ef403edb7558: ALSA: hda - Don't access stereo amps for
mono channel widgets] fixed the handling of mono widgets in general,
but it still misses an exceptional case: namely, a mono mixer widget
taking a single stereo input. In this case, it has stereo volumes
although it's a mono widget, and thus we have to take care of both
left and right input channels, as stated in HD-audio spec ("7.1.3
Widget Interconnection Rules").
This patch covers this missing piece by adding proper checks of stereo
amps in both the generic parser and the proc output codes.

ALSA: hda - Fix regression of HD-audio controller fallback modes
commit a1f3f1ca66bd12c339b17a0c2ef93a093f90a277 upstream.
The commit [63e51fd708f5: ALSA: hda - Don't take unresponsive D3
transition too serious] introduced a conditional fallback behavior to
the HD-audio controller depending on the flag set. However, it
introduced a silly bug, too, that the flag was evaluated in a reverse
way. This resulted in a regression of HD-audio controller driver
where it can't go to the fallback mode at communication errors.
Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this didn't come up until recently
because the affected code path is an error handling that happens only
on an unstable hardware chip. Most of recent chips work stably, thus
they didn't hit this problem. Now, we've got a regression report with
a VIA chip, and this seems indeed requiring the fallback to the
polling mode, and finally the bug was revealed.
The fix is a oneliner to remove the wrong logical NOT in the check.
(Lesson learned - be careful about double negation.)
The bug should be backported to stable, but the patch won't be
applicable to 3.13 or earlier because of the code splits. The stable
fix patches for earlier kernels will be posted later manually.

ALSA: hda - Set single\_adc\_amp flag for CS420x codecs
commit bad994f5b4ab57eec8d56c180edca00505c3eeb2 upstream.
CS420x codecs seem to deal only the single amps of ADC nodes even
though the nodes receive multiple inputs. This leads to the
inconsistent amp value after S3/S4 resume, for example.
The fix is just to set codec->single\_adc\_amp flag. Then the driver
handles these ADC amps as if single connections.

ALSA: hda - Don't access stereo amps for mono channel widgets
commit ef403edb75580a3ec5d155f5de82155f0419c621 upstream.
The current HDA generic parser initializes / modifies the amp values
always in stereo, but this seems causing the problem on ALC3229 codec
that has a few mono channel widgets: namely, these mono widgets react
to actions for both channels equally.
In the driver code, we do care the mono channel and create a control
only for the left channel (as defined in HD-audio spec) for such a
node. When the control is updated, only the left channel value is
changed. However, in the resume, the right channel value is also
restored from the initial value we took as stereo, and this overwrites
the left channel value. This ends up being the silent output as the
right channel has been never touched and remains muted.
This patch covers the places where unconditional stereo amp accesses
are done and converts to the conditional accesses.

spi: pl022: Fix race in giveback() leading to driver lock-up
commit cd6fa8d2ca53cac3226fdcffcf763be390abae32 upstream.
Commit fd316941c ("spi/pl022: disable port when unused") introduced a race,
which leads to possible driver lock up (easily reproducible on SMP).
The problem happens in giveback() function where the completion of the transfer
is signalled to SPI subsystem and then the HW SPI controller is disabled. Another
transfer might be setup in between, which brings driver in locked-up state.
Exact event sequence on SMP:
core0 core1
=> pump\_transfers()
/\* message->state == STATE\_DONE \*/
=> giveback()
=> spi\_finalize\_current\_message()
=> pl022\_unprepare\_transfer\_hardware()
=> pl022\_transfer\_one\_message
=> flush()
=> do\_interrupt\_dma\_transfer()
=> set\_up\_next\_transfer()
/\* Enable SSP, turn on interrupts \*/
writew((readw(SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase)) |
SSP\_CR1\_MASK\_SSE), SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase));
...
=> pl022\_interrupt\_handler()
=> readwriter()
/\* disable the SPI/SSP operation \*/
=> writew((readw(SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase)) &
(~SSP\_CR1\_MASK\_SSE)), SSP\_CR1(pl022->virtbase));
Lockup! SPI controller is disabled and the data will never be received. Whole
SPI subsystem is waiting for transfer ACK and blocked.
So, only signal transfer completion after disabling the controller.

spi: atmel: Fix interrupt setup for PDC transfers
commit 76e1d14b316d6f501ebc001e7a5d86b24ce5b615 upstream.
Additionally to the current DMA transfer the PDC allows to set up a next DMA
transfer. This is useful for larger SPI transfers.
The driver currently waits for ENDRX as end of the transfer. But ENDRX is set
when the current DMA transfer is done (RCR = 0), i.e. it doesn't include the
next DMA transfer.
Thus a subsequent SPI transfer could be started although there is currently a
transfer in progress. This can cause invalid accesses to the SPI slave devices
and to SPI transfer errors.
This issue has been observed on a hardware with a M25P128 SPI NOR flash.
So instead of ENDRX we should wait for RXBUFF. This flag is set if there is
no more DMA transfer in progress (RCR = RNCR = 0).

tpm/ibmvtpm: Additional LE support for tpm\_ibmvtpm\_send
commit 62dfd912ab3b5405b6fe72d0135c37e9648071f1 upstream.
Problem: When IMA and VTPM are both enabled in kernel config,
kernel hangs during bootup on LE OS.
Why?: IMA calls tpm\_pcr\_read() which results in tpm\_ibmvtpm\_send
and tpm\_ibmtpm\_recv getting called. A trace showed that
tpm\_ibmtpm\_recv was hanging.
Resolution: tpm\_ibmtpm\_recv was hanging because tpm\_ibmvtpm\_send
was sending CRQ message that probably did not make much sense
to phype because of Endianness. The fix below sends correctly
converted CRQ for LE. This was not caught before because it
seems IMA is not enabled by default in kernel config and
IMA exercises this particular code path in vtpm.
Tested with IMA and VTPM enabled in kernel config and VTPM
enabled on both a BE OS and a LE OS ppc64 lpar. This exercised
CRQ and TPM command code paths in vtpm.
Patch is against Peter's tpmdd tree on github which included
Vicky's previous vtpm le patches.

cpuset: Fix cpuset sched\_relax\_domain\_level
commit 283cb41f426b723a0255702b761b0fc5d1b53a81 upstream.
The cpuset.sched\_relax\_domain\_level can control how far we do
immediate load balancing on a system. However, it was found on recent
kernels that echo'ing a value into cpuset.sched\_relax\_domain\_level
did not reduce any immediate load balancing.
The reason this occurred was because the update\_domain\_attr\_tree() traversal
did not update for the "top\_cpuset". This resulted in nothing being changed
when modifying the sched\_relax\_domain\_level parameter.
This patch is able to address that problem by having update\_domain\_attr\_tree()
allow updates for the root in the cpuset traversal.

seq\_buf: Fix seq\_buf\_bprintf() truncation
commit 4d4eb4d4fbd9403682e2b75117b6b895531d8e01 upstream.
In seq\_buf\_bprintf(), bstr\_printf() is used to copy the format into the
buffer remaining in the seq\_buf structure. The return of bstr\_printf()
is the amount of characters written to the buffer excluding the '\0',
unless the line was truncated!
If the line copied does not fit, it is truncated, and a '\0' is added
to the end of the buffer. But in this case, '\0' is included in the length
of the line written. To know if the buffer had overflowed, the return
length will be the same or greater than the length of the buffer passed in.
The check in seq\_buf\_bprintf() only checked if the length returned from
bstr\_printf() would fit in the buffer, as the seq\_buf\_bprintf() is only
to be an all or nothing command. It either writes all the string into
the seq\_buf, or none of it. If the string is truncated, the pointers
inside the seq\_buf must be reset to what they were when the function was
called. This is not the case. On overflow, it copies only part of the string.
The fix is to change the overflow check to see if the length returned from
bstr\_printf() is less than the length remaining in the seq\_buf buffer, and not
if it is less than or equal to as it currently does. Then seq\_buf\_bprintf()
will know if the write from bstr\_printf() was truncated or not.

workqueue: fix hang involving racing cancel[\_delayed]\_work\_sync()'s for PREEMPT\_NONE
commit 8603e1b30027f943cc9c1eef2b291d42c3347af1 upstream.
cancel[\_delayed]\_work\_sync() are implemented using
\_\_cancel\_work\_timer() which grabs the PENDING bit using
try\_to\_grab\_pending() and then flushes the work item with PENDING set
to prevent the on-going execution of the work item from requeueing
itself.
try\_to\_grab\_pending() can always grab PENDING bit without blocking
except when someone else is doing the above flushing during
cancelation. In that case, try\_to\_grab\_pending() returns -ENOENT. In
this case, \_\_cancel\_work\_timer() currently invokes flush\_work(). The
assumption is that the completion of the work item is what the other
canceling task would be waiting for too and thus waiting for the same
condition and retrying should allow forward progress without excessive
busy looping
Unfortunately, this doesn't work if preemption is disabled or the
latter task has real time priority. Let's say task A just got woken
up from flush\_work() by the completion of the target work item. If,
before task A starts executing, task B gets scheduled and invokes
\_\_cancel\_work\_timer() on the same work item, its try\_to\_grab\_pending()
will return -ENOENT as the work item is still being canceled by task A
and flush\_work() will also immediately return false as the work item
is no longer executing. This puts task B in a busy loop possibly
preventing task A from executing and clearing the canceling state on
the work item leading to a hang.

}
This patch removes the possible hang by updating \_\_cancel\_work\_timer()
to explicitly wait for clearing of CANCELING rather than invoking
flush\_work() after try\_to\_grab\_pending() fails with -ENOENT.

can: kvaser\_usb: Read all messages in a bulk-in URB buffer
commit 2fec5104f9c61de4cf2205aa355101e19a81f490 upstream.
The Kvaser firmware can only read and write messages that are
not crossing the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary. While
receiving commands from the CAN device, if the next command in
the same URB buffer crossed that max packet size boundary, the
firmware puts a zero-length placeholder command in its place
then moves the real command to the next boundary mark.
The driver did not recognize such behavior, leading to missing
a good number of rx events during a heavy rx load session.
Moreover, a tx URB context only gets freed upon receiving its
respective tx ACK event. Over time, the free tx URB contexts
pool gets depleted due to the missing ACK events. Consequently,
the netif transmission queue gets \_\_permanently\_\_ stopped; no
frames could be sent again except after restarting the CAN
newtwork interface.

ftrace: Fix ftrace enable ordering of sysctl ftrace\_enabled
commit 524a38682573b2e15ab6317ccfe50280441514be upstream.
Some archs (specifically PowerPC), are sensitive with the ordering of
the enabling of the calls to function tracing and setting of the
function to use to be traced.
That is, update\_ftrace\_function() sets what function the ftrace\_caller
trampoline should call. Some archs require this to be set before
calling ftrace\_run\_update\_code().
Another bug was discovered, that ftrace\_startup\_sysctl() called
ftrace\_run\_update\_code() directly. If the function the ftrace\_caller
trampoline changes, then it will not be updated. Instead a call
to ftrace\_startup\_enable() should be called because it tests to see
if the callback changed since the code was disabled, and will
tell the arch to update appropriately. Most archs do not need this
notification, but PowerPC does.
The problem could be seen by the following commands:
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
The trace will show that function tracing was not active.

ftrace: Fix en(dis)able graph caller when en(dis)abling record via sysctl
commit 1619dc3f8f555ee1cdd3c75db3885d5715442b12 upstream.
When ftrace is enabled globally through the proc interface, we must check if
ftrace\_graph\_active is set. If it is set, then we should also pass the
FTRACE\_START\_FUNC\_RET command to ftrace\_run\_update\_code(). Similarly, when
ftrace is disabled globally through the proc interface, we must check if
ftrace\_graph\_active is set. If it is set, then we should also pass the
FTRACE\_STOP\_FUNC\_RET command to ftrace\_run\_update\_code().
Consider the following situation.
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
After this ftrace\_enabled = 0.
# echo function\_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
Since ftrace\_enabled = 0, ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() is never
called.
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
Now ftrace\_enabled will be set to true, but still
ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() will not be called, which is not
desired.
Further if we execute the following after this:
# echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
Now since ftrace\_enabled is set it will call
ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller(), which causes a kernel warning on
the ARM platform.
On the ARM platform, when ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() is called,
it checks whether the old instruction is a nop or not. If it's not a nop,
then it returns an error. If it is a nop then it replaces instruction at
that address with a branch to ftrace\_graph\_caller.
ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() behaves just the opposite. Therefore,
if generic ftrace code ever calls either ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller()
or ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() consecutively two times in a row,
then it will return an error, which will cause the generic ftrace code to
raise a warning.
Note, x86 does not have an issue with this because the architecture
specific code for ftrace\_enable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() and
ftrace\_disable\_ftrace\_graph\_caller() does not check the previous state,
and calling either of these functions twice in a row has no ill effect.

ftrace: Clear REGS\_EN and TRAMP\_EN flags on disabling record via sysctl
commit b24d443b8f17d9776f5fc1f6c780a0a21eb02913 upstream.
When /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled is set to zero, all function
tracing is disabled. But the records that represent the functions
still hold information about the ftrace\_ops that are hooked to them.
ftrace\_ops may request "REGS" (have a full set of pt\_regs passed to
the callback), or "TRAMP" (the ops has its own trampoline to use).
When the record is updated to represent the state of the ops hooked
to it, it sets "REGS\_EN" and/or "TRAMP\_EN" to state that the callback
points to the correct trampoline (REGS has its own trampoline).
When ftrace\_enabled is set to zero, all ftrace locations are a nop,
so they do not point to any trampoline. But the \_EN flags are still
set. This can cause the accounting to go wrong when ftrace\_enabled
is cleared and an ops that has a trampoline is registered or unregistered.
For example, the following will cause ftrace to crash:
# echo function\_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
# echo function\_graph > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
As function\_graph uses a trampoline, when ftrace\_enabled is set to zero
the updates to the record are not done. When enabling function\_graph
again, the record will still have the TRAMP\_EN flag set, and it will
look for an op that has a trampoline other than the function\_graph
ops, and fail to find one.

drm/radeon: drop ttm two ended allocation
commit a239118a24b3bf9089751068e431dfb63dc4168b upstream.
radeon\_bo\_create() calls radeon\_ttm\_placement\_from\_domain()
before ttm\_bo\_init() is called. radeon\_ttm\_placement\_from\_domain()
uses the ttm bo size to determine when to select top down
allocation but since the ttm bo is not initialized yet the
check is always false. It only took effect when buffers
were validated later. It also seemed to regress suspend
and resume on some systems possibly due to it not
taking effect in radeon\_bo\_create().
radeon\_bo\_create() and radeon\_ttm\_placement\_from\_domain()
need to be reworked substantially for this to be optimally
effective. Re-enable it at that point.

drm/radeon: fix wait to actually occur after the signaling callback
commit b6610101718d4ab90d793c482625e98eb1262cad upstream.
A normal wait adds to the front of the tail. By doing something
similar to fence\_default\_wait the fence code can run without racing.
This is a complete fix for "panic on suspend from KDE with radeon",
and a partial fix for "Radeon: System pauses on TAHITI". On tahiti
si\_irq\_set needs to be fixed too, to completely flush the writes
before radeon\_fence\_activity is called in radeon\_fence\_enable\_signaling.

arm64: Invalidate the TLB corresponding to intermediate page table levels
commit 285994a62c80f1d72c6924282bcb59608098d5ec upstream.
The ARM architecture allows the caching of intermediate page table
levels and page table freeing requires a sequence like:
pmd\_clear()
TLB invalidation
pte page freeing
With commit 5e5f6dc10546 (arm64: mm: enable HAVE\_RCU\_TABLE\_FREE logic),
the page table freeing batching was moved from tlb\_remove\_page() to
tlb\_remove\_table(). The former takes care of TLB invalidation as this is
also shared with pte clearing and page cache page freeing. The latter,
however, does not invalidate the TLBs for intermediate page table levels
as it probably relies on the architecture code to do it if required.
When the mm->mm\_users < 2, tlb\_remove\_table() does not do any batching
and page table pages are freed before tlb\_finish\_mmu() which performs
the actual TLB invalidation.
This patch introduces \_\_tlb\_flush\_pgtable() for arm64 and calls it from
the {pte,pmd,pud}\_free\_tlb() directly without relying on deferred page
table freeing.

net: compat: Update get\_compat\_msghdr() to match copy\_msghdr\_from\_user() behaviour
[ Upstream commit 91edd096e224941131f896b86838b1e59553696a ]
Commit db31c55a6fb2 (net: clamp ->msg\_namelen instead of returning an
error) introduced the clamping of msg\_namelen when the unsigned value
was larger than sizeof(struct sockaddr\_storage). This caused a
msg\_namelen of -1 to be valid. The native code was subsequently fixed by
commit dbb490b96584 (net: socket: error on a negative msg\_namelen).
In addition, the native code sets msg\_namelen to 0 when msg\_name is
NULL. This was done in commit (6a2a2b3ae075 net:socket: set msg\_namelen
to 0 if msg\_name is passed as NULL in msghdr struct from userland) and
subsequently updated by 08adb7dabd48 (fold verify\_iovec() into
copy\_msghdr\_from\_user()).
This patch brings the get\_compat\_msghdr() in line with
copy\_msghdr\_from\_user().

rxrpc: bogus MSG\_PEEK test in rxrpc\_recvmsg()
[ Upstream commit 7d985ed1dca5c90535d67ce92ef6ca520302340a ]
[I would really like an ACK on that one from dhowells; it appears to be
quite straightforward, but...]
MSG\_PEEK isn't passed to ->recvmsg() via msg->msg\_flags; as the matter of
fact, neither the kernel users of rxrpc, nor the syscalls ever set that bit
in there. It gets passed via flags; in fact, another such check in the same
function is done correctly - as flags & MSG\_PEEK.
It had been that way (effectively disabled) for 8 years, though, so the patch
needs beating up - that case had never been tested. If it is correct, it's
-stable fodder.

It should be checking flags, not msg->msg\_flags. It's ->sendmsg()
instances that need to look for that in ->msg\_flags, ->recvmsg() ones
(including the other ->recvmsg() instance in that file, as well as
unix\_dgram\_recvmsg() this one claims to be imitating) check in flags.

rds: avoid potential stack overflow
[ Upstream commit f862e07cf95d5b62a5fc5e981dd7d0dbaf33a501 ]
The rds\_iw\_update\_cm\_id function stores a large 'struct rds\_sock' object
on the stack in order to pass a pair of addresses. This happens to just
fit withint the 1024 byte stack size warning limit on x86, but just
exceed that limit on ARM, which gives us this warning:
net/rds/iw\_rdma.c:200:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
As the use of this large variable is basically bogus, we can rearrange
the code to not do that. Instead of passing an rds socket into
rds\_iw\_get\_device, we now just pass the two addresses that we have
available in rds\_iw\_update\_cm\_id, and we change rds\_iw\_get\_mr accordingly,
to create two address structures on the stack there.

net: sysctl\_net\_core: check SNDBUF and RCVBUF for min length
[ Upstream commit b1cb59cf2efe7971d3d72a7b963d09a512d994c9 ]
sysctl has sysctl.net.core.rmem\_\*/wmem\_\* parameters which can be
set to incorrect values. Given that 'struct sk\_buff' allocates from
rcvbuf, incorrectly set buffer length could result to memory
allocation failures. For example, set them as follows:

net.core.wmem\_default = 64
# sysctl net.core.wmem\_default=64
net.core.wmem\_default = 64
# ping localhost -s 1024 -i 0 > /dev/null
This could result to the following failure:

tcp: restore 1.5x per RTT limit to CUBIC cwnd growth in congestion avoidance
[ Upstream commit d578e18ce93f5d33a7120fd57c453e22a4c0fc37 ]
Commit 814d488c6126 ("tcp: fix the timid additive increase on stretch
ACKs") fixed a bug where tcp\_cong\_avoid\_ai() would either credit a
connection with an increase of snd\_cwnd\_cnt, or increase snd\_cwnd, but
not both, resulting in cwnd increasing by 1 packet on at most every
alternate invocation of tcp\_cong\_avoid\_ai().
Although the commit correctly implemented the CUBIC algorithm, which
can increase cwnd by as much as 1 packet per 1 packet ACKed (2x per
RTT), in practice that could be too aggressive: in tests on network
paths with small buffers, YouTube server retransmission rates nearly
doubled.
This commit restores CUBIC to a maximum cwnd growth rate of 1 packet
per 2 packets ACKed (1.5x per RTT). In YouTube tests this restored
retransmit rates to low levels.
Testing: This patch has been tested in datacenter netperf transfers
and live youtube.com and google.com servers.

tcp: fix tcp\_cong\_avoid\_ai() credit accumulation bug with decreases in w
[ Upstream commit 9949afa42be0b76f5832db112ce51bb6b35b2abb ]
The recent change to tcp\_cong\_avoid\_ai() to handle stretch ACKs
introduced a bug where snd\_cwnd\_cnt could accumulate a very large
value while w was large, and then if w was reduced snd\_cwnd could be
incremented by a large delta, leading to a large burst and high packet
loss. This was tickled when CUBIC's bictcp\_update() sets "ca->cnt =
100 \* cwnd".
This bug crept in while preparing the upstream version of
814d488c6126.

sparc64: Fix several bugs in memmove().
[ Upstream commit 2077cef4d5c29cf886192ec32066f783d6a80db8 ]
Firstly, handle zero length calls properly. Believe it or not there
are a few of these happening during early boot.
Next, we can't just drop to a memcpy() call in the forward copy case
where dst <= src. The reason is that the cache initializing stores
used in the Niagara memcpy() implementations can end up clearing out
cache lines before we've sourced their original contents completely.
For example, considering NG4memcpy, the main unrolled loop begins like
this:
load src + 0x00
load src + 0x08
load src + 0x10
load src + 0x18
load src + 0x20
store dst + 0x00
Assume dst is 64 byte aligned and let's say that dst is src - 8 for
this memcpy() call. That store at the end there is the one to the
first line in the cache line, thus clearing the whole line, which thus
clobbers "src + 0x28" before it even gets loaded.
To avoid this, just fall through to a simple copy only mildly
optimized for the case where src and dst are 8 byte aligned and the
length is a multiple of 8 as well. We could get fancy and call
GENmemcpy() but this is good enough for how this thing is actually
used.

The reason is that state is never reset (stays with PERF\_HES\_UPTODATE set).
Add a call to sparc\_pmu\_enable\_event during the added\_event handling.
Clean up the encoding since pmu\_start calls sparc\_pmu\_enable\_event which
does the same. Passing PERF\_EF\_RELOAD to sparc\_pmu\_start means the call
to sparc\_perf\_event\_set\_period can be removed as well.

Since SEMCTL is defined as 3, and SEMTIMEDOP is defined as 4,
the comparison "call <= SEMCTL" will always prevent SEMTIMEDOP
