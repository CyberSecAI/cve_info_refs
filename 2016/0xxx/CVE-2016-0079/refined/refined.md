Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `CmpCmdHiveOpen` kernel function used by `NtLoadKeyEx`. When `NtLoadKeyEx` is called with a flag to open a registry hive in read-only mode, the kernel function `CmpInitHiveFromFile` is called. If `CmpInitHiveFromFile` fails to open the hive read-only (e.g., due to STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED), it will recall the initialization function *while impersonating the calling process* but *without* passing the read-only flag. This leads to the hive being opened in write mode even when read-only access was requested initially.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect flag handling:** The kernel function forgets to pass the read-only flag when retrying the hive opening, after an initial failure.
- **Impersonation without privilege check:**  The kernel impersonates the calling process without correctly handling the read-only intent, leading to an escalation of privilege.
- **DACL Copying:** When log files are created during the write mode hive opening, the DACL from the main hive file is copied to these log files. This enables an attacker to redirect writes and modify the file content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate their privileges from a normal user to SYSTEM by exploiting the write mode hive opening in a system service context, such as the WinRT COM activation routines of RPCSS, which utilizes  `NtLoadKeyEx`.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By controlling the main hive file and its location, an attacker can cause log files to be created in arbitrary locations (via symlink tricks), with DACLs they control. This can be leveraged to overwrite or create any file as SYSTEM, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **User-Controlled Hive:** The attacker needs to have control over a registry hive file and its location which is opened via system service such as RPCSS.
- **Symbolic Links:** The attacker uses symbolic links to manipulate file paths and redirect log file creation to arbitrary locations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user on the targeted system.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate a registry hive and its location.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable `NtLoadKeyEx` call, for example, by abusing a system service like RPCSS that loads user controlled hives.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code in C# demonstrates how a normal user can trigger the vulnerability and cause a read-only hive to be opened in write mode with log files creation.
- The vulnerability can be triggered in the WinRT COM activation routines of RPCSS.
- The vulnerability was reported by Google Security Research.

This analysis provides more detail than the original CVE description by outlining the specific code flaw, the role of impersonation and file redirection, and detailing the attack scenario including the use of symbolic links to achieve arbitrary file writes.
