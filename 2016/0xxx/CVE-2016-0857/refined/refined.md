Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-0857:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to an insecure use of `strcpy` in the Advantech WebAccess datacore service (`datacore.exe`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function copies a string into a buffer without performing bounds checking. If the source string is larger than the destination buffer, it leads to a buffer overflow on the heap.
- **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely without requiring authentication.
- **Insecure IOCTL Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered within the implementation of the `0x5228` IOCTL (as mentioned in two advisories) and `0x7920` (as mentioned in one advisory) in the Kernel subsystem, indicating that an insecure handling of this IOCTL leads to the buffer overflow.
- The `AlarmMessage` parameter is mentioned as the source of the overflow when processing IOCTL `0x5228`.
- The overflow occurs when using `strcpy` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **Administrator Context:** The code execution occurs within the context of an administrator, granting the attacker significant control over the system.
- **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **IOCTL:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the `0x5228` or `0x7920` IOCTL of the Kernel subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess instance.
- **Low Skill Level:** According to the ICS-CERT advisory, an attacker with low skills would be able to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required for the exploit.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Advantech WebAccess versions 8.0 and prior.
- Advantech has released a patch in WebAccess version 8.1.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS has a digital vaccine protection filter to protect against this vulnerability.
