- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the `DownloadServlet` of Oracle Application Testing Suite. The `reportName` parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal when `downloadType` is specified as `report`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to specify file paths outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can exfiltrate arbitrary files from the system by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a specially crafted request to the `DownloadServlet` with a malicious `reportName` parameter to access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
