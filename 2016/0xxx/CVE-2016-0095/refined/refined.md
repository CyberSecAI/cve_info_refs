Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-0095:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the Windows kernel-mode driver's handling of `CreateWindowStation`.
- Specifically, the issue stems from a failure to check for a NULL pointer before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which occurs when the code attempts to access memory through a pointer that doesn't point to a valid location (it's NULL).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to elevate their privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel, granting them significant control over the system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack must originate from a local user account on the target system.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires some form of user interaction, such as visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file. This implies that the attacker needs to convince a user to perform an action that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted application, crafted by the attacker, interacts with the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have an account on the target machine, but it does not need to be an administrator account.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted application on the target system.
- **Social Engineering (Implied):**  Some social engineering or trickery is required to induce the target user to run the attacker's code or interact with malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in the Win32k component.
- Microsoft released a security update (MS16-034) to address this and other related vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was reported by bee13oy of CloverSec Labs.
- This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.2 with an AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C vector.
