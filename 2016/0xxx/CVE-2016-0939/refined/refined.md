Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-0939

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of PDF files, where a malformed PDF can cause the dereferencing of uninitialized memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Uninitialized Memory Dereference:** The core issue is that when processing a specially crafted PDF file, the software attempts to access memory that has not been properly initialized. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or, more critically, the ability for an attacker to control program flow.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The advisory from Adobe also categorizes this CVE as a memory corruption vulnerability. This suggests that the uninitialized memory dereference is one mechanism by which memory can be corrupted, ultimately leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable Adobe Acrobat Reader DC process. This means the attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system, including installing malware, stealing data, or performing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious PDF File:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted, malformed PDF file to the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires user interaction. The user must either open the malicious PDF file directly or visit a webpage that causes the PDF to be loaded through the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely, as the exploit can be delivered through a file download or a website.
*   **Crafted Malicious PDF:** The attacker must possess the technical capability to craft a malformed PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **User Enticement:** The attacker must be able to entice the victim to open the malicious PDF or visit a malicious webpage hosting the PDF.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Reader DC on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
*   Adobe has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Jaanus Kp of Clarified Security.
