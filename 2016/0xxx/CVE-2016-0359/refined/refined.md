- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of input within HTTP responses, which allows a remote attacker to inject malicious content via specially crafted URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP Response Splitting
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to: Web cache poisoning, Cross-site scripting, and potential unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL to the affected server. When a user clicks the link, the server returns a split response, allowing for further attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and have a victim click on them. The attacker does not need any special access or credentials on the server.
