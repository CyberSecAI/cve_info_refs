  "CVE-2016-0063": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Type confusion in how Internet Explorer handles the DOMImplementation object. Specifically, by copying the `hasFeature` or `isPrototypeof` method of a `DOMImplementation` object from an HTML page to an SVG page and then calling it as a method of a new object. This leads to the code expecting a VARIANT object of one type but operating on an object of a different type, or assuming an object implements IUnknown when it does not.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Type confusion, out-of-bounds write, memory corruption, incorrect function execution, stack corruption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take full control of the system.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted webpage that the user must visit or a malicious file they must open.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious web page or file.  Disabling Javascript mitigates the exploit."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a type confusion error when calling the `isPrototypeof` method of the DOMImplementation interface. The code incorrectly assumes an object implements the IUnknown interface when it does not. The code then attempts to call the `Release` method of IUnknown, which leads to an invalid memory access due to the missing vftable.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Type confusion, dereference of invalid memory, missing vftable.  The code attempts to call a method through a vftable at offset 0 of an object that does not have a vftable.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution may be possible. An attacker who can control the value at offset 0 of the object or allocate memory at that address might achieve code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted webpage.  The user must be enticed into opening the page in Internet Explorer.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to get the target user to open a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. Disabling Javascript prevents the trigger of the vulnerable code path."
