Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-0815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability in the Android mediaserver component. This occurs during the processing of specially crafted media files and data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability specifically involves an out-of-bounds write during media processing. This means that the code writes data outside of the allocated memory, corrupting memory.
-  **Memory Corruption:** This leads to a memory corruption which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution within the context of the mediaserver process.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** The mediaserver service has access to audio and video streams, as well as other privileges not normally accessible to third-party apps, meaning that if this service is compromised, further attacks can occur.
-   **Device Compromise:**  The attacker can potentially fully compromise the device through RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Multiple Methods:** The vulnerability can be exploited through various attack vectors, including:
    -   Email
    -   Web browsing (malicious websites embedding specially crafted media)
    -   MMS (multimedia messaging service)
-   **Remote Content:** The vulnerability is triggered when the mediaserver processes remote media content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending malicious media content to a vulnerable device. No physical access is needed.
-   **Ability to Deliver Media Content:** Attackers need to be able to deliver specially crafted media files via an exploit vector.
-   **No user interaction** is likely needed since the media processing happens automatically on the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to the possibility of remote code execution with elevated privileges.
-   The vulnerability affects multiple Android versions: 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0 and 6.0.1
-   The fix for this issue was made internally at Google.
-   The AOSP commit that addresses the issue is: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/5403587a74aee2fb57076528c3927851531c8afb](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/5403587a74aee2fb57076528c3927851531c8afb)
