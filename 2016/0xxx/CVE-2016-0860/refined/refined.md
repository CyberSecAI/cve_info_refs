Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-0860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the BwpAlarm subsystem of the Advantech WebAccess application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119):** A crafted RPC request to the BwpAlarm subsystem can cause a buffer overflow on global variables.
*   Two specific instances of the vulnerability are described by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI):
    *   **ZDI-16-058:** A global overflow vulnerability exists in a call to `strcpy` using the `ProjectName` parameter within the implementation of the 0x11173 IOCTL in the BwpAlarm subsystem.
    *   **ZDI-16-074:** A global overflow vulnerability exists in a call to `memcpy` within the implementation of the 0x11172 IOCTL in the BwpAlarm subsystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable instances of Advantech WebAccess.
*   The attacker can execute code in the context of an administrator of the system, potentially gaining full control.
*   According to ICS-CERT, exploitation could also allow an attacker to modify data or disrupt services (though the provided CVSS score for this CVE does not include confidentiality or availability impact, and this text from the ICS-CERT report may be generalized and not specific to this CVE).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (remote).
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted RPC requests to the BwpAlarm subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess server.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   A low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected product is Advantech WebAccess version 8.0 and prior versions.
*   Advantech has released version 8.1 to address this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by a specific filter.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-09-17, and a coordinated public release of the advisory occurred on 2016-02-05.
