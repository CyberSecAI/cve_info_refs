## Security Update in Microsoft Exchange Server to Address Spoofing (3124557)

Published: January 12, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow spoofing if Outlook Web Access (OWA) fails to properly handle web requests, and sanitize user input and email content.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2016. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Exchange OWA validates web requests and by helping to ensure that OWA properly sanitizes user input and email content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3124557](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3124557).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Exchange Spoofing Vulnerabilities

Multiple spoofing vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Exchange Server when Outlook Web Access (OWA) fails to properly handle web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could perform script or content injection attacks, and attempt to trick the user into disclosing sensitive information. An attacker could also redirect the user to a malicious website that could spoof content or be used as a pivot to chain an attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker could send a specially crafted email containing a malicious link to a user. An attacker could also use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking the malicious link. However, in both examples the user must click the malicious link. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how OWA validates web requests.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exchange Spoofing Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0029](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0029) | No | No |
| Exchange Spoofing Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0030](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0030) | No | No |
| Exchange Spoofing Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0031](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0031) | No | No |
| Exchange Spoofing Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-0032](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0032) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* To generate the malicious link, an attacker must already be an authenticated Microsoft Exchange user and be able to send email messages.
* The malicious link could be sent in an email, but the attacker would have to convince a user to open the link in order to exploit the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.
