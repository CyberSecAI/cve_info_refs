- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from Microsoft Exchange Server's Outlook Web Access (OWA) failing to properly handle web requests and sanitize user input and email content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Spoofing vulnerability due to improper validation of web requests and insufficient sanitization of user input and email content within OWA. This allows for script or content injection attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform script or content injection attacks, trick users into disclosing sensitive information, redirect users to malicious websites, spoof content, or act as a pivot to chain attacks with other web service vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could send a specially crafted email containing a malicious link or use a chat client to social engineer a user into clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated Microsoft Exchange user able to send email messages and social engineer a user to click the malicious link.
