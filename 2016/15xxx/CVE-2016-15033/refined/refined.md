Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-15033 (Based on the vulnerability description, it matches)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control and insufficient input sanitization in the `delete-all-comments.php` file of the "Delete All Comments" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows unauthenticated users to trigger a file upload by manipulating the `$_POST['restorefromfileNAME']` and `$_POST['restorefromfileURL']` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin's code permits uploading of files to the `/plugins/delete-all-comments/backup/` directory without proper validation, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable functionality is not restricted to administrators and can be accessed by any user, including those not logged in to the WordPress site.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize the `$_POST['restorefromfileNAME']` and `$_POST['restorefromfileURL']` parameters, making it possible to specify a file path and a remote URL of the attacker's choosing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking full control of the website.
*   **Website Defacement/Takeover:** Attackers can modify or delete website content, inject malicious code, or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could access sensitive information stored on the server, including database credentials and user data.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The compromised website can be used to distribute malware to visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the `delete-all-comments.php` script with the manipulated `restorefromfileNAME` and `restorefromfileURL` parameters.
*   **Publicly Accessible Plugin File:** The vulnerable `delete-all-comments.php` is located in the plugin's directory, which is usually publicly accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target website.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must understand how to craft HTTP POST requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials for the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was a zero-day exploit at the time of discovery and was actively exploited.
*   The plugin was removed from the WordPress plugin repository, so no official patch was made available.
*   Users of the plugin were advised to uninstall it immediately.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the plugin author but no action was taken and then reported to the WordPress plugin department who removed the plugin.
*   The `file_put_contents` function was used to write the contents of the `restorefromfileURL` into a file specified by the `restorefromfileNAME`.
*   This exploit allowed attackers to upload a file to the `/wp-content/plugins/delete-all-comments/backup/` folder without any authentication.
