# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# The Go Language Collective is no longer active.

Collectives™ on Stack Overflow is a new offering in beta release. Currently a Collective requires participation from
a sponsoring organization, so in some cases a Collective may be decommissioned when the sponsorship ends. All questions and
answers that comprised a Collective remain accessible.

## Description

[![@elithrar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18544?u=9070a4c1594f994f1db530596d2f94a703537aff&v=4&size=48)](/elithrar)[elithrar](https://github.com/elithrar)opened [on Apr 25, 2016](https://github.com/dinever/golf/issues/20#issue-150901151)

[`randomBytes`](https://github.com/dinever/golf/blob/7a06be0db26a0fb2694cec1bf381ba75f254df87/xsrf.go#L11) in xsrf.go uses `math.rand` to generate CSRF tokens. This is unsafe/insecure, and because it is seeded with `time.UnixNano`, generates predictable results that would allow an attacker to bypass CSRF protection.

[`sessionID`](https://github.com/dinever/golf/blob/7a06be0db26a0fb2694cec1bf381ba75f254df87/session.go#L38) in session.go correctly uses `crypto/rand` to generate a session ID. You should split this code out and re-use it for both session ID generation *and* CSRF token generation.

(You're also welcome to import or repurpose <https://github.com/gorilla/csrf> for this as well, which has some additional mitigations against CSRF bypass)

Issue: [#20](https://github.com/dinever/golf/issues/20)

Uses crypto/rand instead of math/rand for XSRF token generation, as [@elithrar](https://github.com/elithrar) suggested. In that issue it was also suggested that we either use gorilla/csrf or repurpose it for Golf, so this PR may not close the issue.

| LGTM. This is probably the more important piece (using another lib can come later). |
