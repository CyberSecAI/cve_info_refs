{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code was vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenated user-provided input (`$year`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `data` parameter of an AJAX request. The user-controlled data is passed as the `$year` variable to the `getStatsByType` function, which then constructs the SQL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send AJAX requests to the server with manipulated `data` parameter values."
