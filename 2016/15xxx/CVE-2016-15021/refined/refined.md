The provided content contains a commit that fixes an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by directly embedding user-controlled input (geneName, tmp[0], tmp[1], tmp[2], tmp[3], id) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious input passed through the `geneName`, `tmp` array and id variables in the functions `initRegionListByGeneName`, `initRvisByGene`, `initVariant`, and `initAnnotationMap`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `geneName`, `tmp` array and id variables that are used in constructing the SQL queries.

**Technical details:**
The commit `cbc79a68145e845f951113d184b4de207c341599` addresses the SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code changes in the commit replace the vulnerable string concatenation method with the use of `PreparedStatement` and parameter binding. This ensures that input is treated as data and not part of SQL queries.

Specifically:
- In `src/main/java/model/Input.java`, the SQL queries in `initRegionListByGeneName` and `initRvisByGene` functions are changed to use `PreparedStatement`
- In `src/main/java/model/Output.java`, the SQL query in `initVariant` function is changed to use `PreparedStatement`
- In `src/main/java/object/Variant.java`, the SQL query in `initAnnotationMap` function is changed to use `PreparedStatement`
- In `src/main/java/util/DBManager.java`, a new method `prepareStatement` was added to prepare queries with the `connection` object.
