Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-15023:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `getextension.php` file. Specifically, the script used the `$_GET['extension']` parameter to construct a file path without properly validating it, allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The `getextension.php` script was vulnerable to directory traversal because it did not properly validate the `extension` parameter. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker could access files outside of the intended extensions directory.
- **Insecure File Inclusion:** The script used `include()` with a path derived from user-controlled input, making it susceptible to including arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker could read sensitive files on the server by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability. This could include configuration files, source code, or other data not intended for public access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker would manipulate the `extension` parameter within a GET request to the `getextension.php` file, using directory traversal sequences like `../` to move up the directory tree and access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable `getextension.php` script.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the `extension` parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal.

**Mitigation:**

The commit `49fff155c303d6cd06ce8f97bba56c9084bf08ac` addresses the vulnerability by implementing the following changes:
*   Introduced a whitelist approach by defining the allowed root directory `($WEBCONFIG['sitefusionPath'].'/extensions')`.
*   Uses `realpath` to resolve the provided path and the allowed root path to resolve any symbolic links/relative pathing.
*   Checks to ensure that resolved path is still contained within the allowed root using `substr` comparison.
*   Adds a check to ensure the resolved path exists using `file_exists`.

This ensures that the included file is located under the `/extensions` directory and prevents accessing files outside this directory.
