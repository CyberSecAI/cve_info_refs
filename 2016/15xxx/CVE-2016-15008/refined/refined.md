**Commit Message:** "fixed XSS injection vulns on channel.php"

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The commit addresses Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in the `channel.php` file (though the diff is shown in javascript files). The code was vulnerable to XSS because it was directly inserting user-provided data into HTML without proper sanitization. Specifically, the code was not encoding user-supplied strings before displaying them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious scripts could be injected through user-controlled data and executed by other users viewing the page. The javascript code used to construct HTML was not sanitizing data before insertion into the DOM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that could:
    *   Steal cookies and session information.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the page and deface the website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
*   **Data Theft:** Through malicious JavaScript, an attacker might gain access to sensitive data displayed on the page or even data stored in the user's browser.
*   **Account Compromise:** In some cases, this may lead to account compromise through cookie theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User-Provided Data:** The attack vector is through user-controlled input that is used in the construction of HTML. This can include, but is not limited to:
    *   Command names and responses.
    *   Quotes.
    *   Auto-reply triggers and responses.
    *   Highlight titles.
    *   Boir data (character, floor, seed, items).
    *   Channel prefixes

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious data into the application through the vulnerable input fields.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to have admin privileges, as the injected code would be executed on other users' browsers.

**Specific Code Changes:**

The provided diff shows modifications to `js/channel.js` and `js/common.js` that aim to mitigate the XSS vulnerabilities:
*   **`js/channel.js`**: The code now uses `cleanHtmlText()` and `cleanHtmlAttr()` to sanitize user inputs. This is done when displaying:
    *   Command responses (both in the edit modal and in the table)
    *   Quotes (both in the edit modal and in the table)
    *   Auto-reply triggers and responses
    *   Highlight titles
    *   Boir data and items
    *   Channel prefixes
*   **`js/common.js`:** This file introduces the `cleanHtmlText` function, which replaces potentially dangerous characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `/` with their HTML entities. This ensures that when user-provided data is embedded in the HTML, it is not interpreted as code.  The `cleanHtmlAttr` function replaces double quotes to prevent breaking HTML attributes.

**Additional notes:**
*   The commit message in the diff clearly mentions "fixed XSS injection vulns", making it highly relevant to a CVE related to XSS.
*   The code changes clearly address the vulnerability by adding encoding/sanitization functions.
*   The diff highlights multiple instances where sanitization functions are implemented, demonstrating that XSS was an issue in various parts of the page.

This commit provides a clear example of a fix for XSS vulnerabilities and highlights the importance of sanitizing user inputs before displaying them in a web application.
