The provided content is related to CVE-2016-15028.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was a lack of proper response verification in the ICEPAY REST API .NET client. Specifically, the client did not verify the checksum of the responses received from the server, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing checksum verification: The client did not validate the checksum of responses, allowing an attacker to modify responses without detection.
- Man-in-the-middle vulnerability: An attacker positioned between the client and the server could intercept and manipulate API responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially manipulate responses from the ICEPAY API, leading to:
- Fraudulent transactions or refunds
- Data breaches or manipulation of financial data
- Incorrect application state

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: An attacker intercepts network traffic between the client and the ICEPAY API server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client application and the ICEPAY API server, like a compromised network or router.
- Ability to manipulate the intercepted API responses.

**Additional Details:**
The fix for the vulnerability involves enforcing the presence and validity of a checksum header in API responses. If a checksum header is not present or is invalid, the response is deemed invalid, and the client returns an error. The fix also includes a message stating that if a checksum is missing, the likely cause is that the merchant ID was entered incorrectly.
