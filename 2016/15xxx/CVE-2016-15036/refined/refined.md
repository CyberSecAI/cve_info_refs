Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-15036:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `Get()` method in `cluster_id.go`, which retrieves the cluster ID, was implemented as an "insert if not exist"-style retriever without proper concurrency protection. This means that if multiple concurrent requests were made to get the cluster ID, it could lead to race conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race Condition:** Concurrent calls to the `Get()` method could result in multiple inserts or reads occurring simultaneously.  The code was missing a read-write lock to protect access to the underlying secret used for storing the cluster ID. Specifically, if the secret didn't exist, multiple concurrent calls could attempt to create it resulting in undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability was an intermittent disruption in component version collection. The race condition led to data inconsistency when multiple components attempted to read the cluster ID concurrently leading to failures in retrieving component versions. This was not a direct security vulnerability, but a bug causing data integrity issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by concurrent requests within the application itself. An attacker can not directly cause this vulnerability to occur, but if an attacker was able to trigger concurrent actions within the application, the race condition could occur.
- There is no mention of remote exploitation or malicious inputs; the issue stems from the application's internal logic, and the method of component version collection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not directly cause this vulnerability. This is an internal application issue caused by concurrent requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved adding a read-write lock (`c.rwm.Lock()` and `defer c.rwm.Unlock()`) to the `Get()` method in `data/cluster_id.go`.
- Additionally, the fix included removing the static cluster ID getter in `jobs/jobs.go` and instead passing a `data.ClusterID` type to `sendVersionsImpl`. This ensured that the locking mechanism was properly used for concurrent jobs.
- The pull request ([#94](https://github.com/deis/workflow-manager/pull/94)) and the commit ([`31fe3bc`](/deis/workflow-manager/commit/31fe3bccbdde134a185752e53380330d16053f7f)) describe the fix.
- The vulnerability was addressed in the v2.3.3 release.
