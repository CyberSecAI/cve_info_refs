This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

cluster\_id is vulnerable to race condition when called concurrently ([#94](https://github.com/deis/workflow-manager/pull/94)

)

* fix(cluster_id): Get() is "insert if not exist", needs read-write lock protection

* fix(jobs): remove static clusterID getter in sendVersionsImpl

1) add generic data.ClusterID type in sendVersions type struct
2) enable common clusterID reference to be included in multiple, concurrent jobs, so that appropriate locking can be enforced
```
