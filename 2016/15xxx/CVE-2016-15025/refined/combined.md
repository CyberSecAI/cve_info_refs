### @ssbrewster **[ssbrewster](/ssbrewster)** commented [Apr 13, 2016](#issue-148169637)

Mitigate against reflected XSS attacks in production by returning

the custom 404 response object instead of express' default 404

response

A reflected XSS vulnerability was discovered using the Burp pen test tool and successfully tested

by passing an arbitrary url parameter GET /images/?41b68(a)184a9=1

This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response meaning that it is possible to inject JavaScript commands into the returned document

This fixes [#132](https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel/issues/132)

Sorry, something went wrong.
