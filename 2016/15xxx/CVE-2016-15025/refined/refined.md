Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's default handling of 404 errors. Specifically, the Express framework's default 404 response was being used which echoed user input from the URL back into the response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application echoes arbitrary URL parameters back into the response without sanitization or encoding.
*  **Lack of Custom Error Handling**: The application did not have custom handling for invalid requests, which lead to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL parameters. When a user visits the crafted URL, the injected script would execute in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Session Hijacking/Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The primary attack vector is through URL parameters. An attacker can craft a URL with a malicious script embedded in a parameter, like `GET /images/?<script>alert('XSS')</script>=1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create URLs with malicious payloads.
*   **Victim Interaction**: An attacker needs a victim to click on the crafted URL. This might require social engineering or embedding the link on a website/email.
*  **No privileged access required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any specific access to the application's backend or any prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was identified using the Burp Suite penetration testing tool.
*   The fix involves returning a custom 404 response object, preventing the direct reflection of the URL parameters.
* The vulnerable URLs were in the `/js/*`, `/images/*`, `/styles/*`, and `/app/*` routes.
