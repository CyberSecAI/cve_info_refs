[`c9eea3f`](/3breadt/dd-plist/commit/c9eea3f2b78585e0fd974e1e44aa31ad164cd359)

Changes from 1.17 to 1.18:

* NSObject.wrap() has been replaced by an improved serialization logic implemented in NSObject.fromJavaObject() ([#21](https://github.com/3breadt/dd-plist/pull/21))
* Fixed serialization of byte arrays as NSData
* Fixed parsing of UTF-8 encoded ASCII property lists ([#25](https://github.com/3breadt/dd-plist/pull/25))
* Protect XML parser against external XXE attacks ([#26](https://github.com/3breadt/dd-plist/pull/26))
* Fixed handling of empty files ([#30](https://github.com/3breadt/dd-plist/pull/30))
* Added support for hexadecimal integer notation in XML property lists ([#30](https://github.com/3breadt/dd-plist/pull/30))
* Improved binary encoding of NSDictionary to generate IDs for the keys like Apple's reference implementation does
* Many code cleanups

1. Take steps to guard against XXE attacks (note that <!DOCTYPE> cannot be disabled in XML plists). See: [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML\_External\_Entity\_(XXE)\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet#Java](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Java)
2. Resolve the actual PLIST DTD from inside the JAR file itself, and prevent resolution of other external XML resources.
3. Make XMLPlistParser.getDocBuilder public.

| First of all, I greatly appreciate your effort to make this library more secure.  *Regarding 1)*  The code, especially setting the features, needs to be tested under Android because it uses a different DocumentBuilder implementation than the Oracle JRE. And so far this library has remained Android compatible. Have you done this?  *Regarding 2)*  I would not redistribute the DTD which originates from <http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd> and thus may be copyrighted by Apple Inc. That is why the current DocumentBuilder uses an EntityResolver which returns an empty input stream.  As DTD validation is anyway disabled I see no reason to change that behavior. Or does this in any way compromise the fix against XXE attacks? |

| Fair enough, I haven't tested whether these properties work on Android. I could wrap each in a try/catch block in case they're not supported. And I understand your copyright concern, I guess it's not strictly necessary to have there anyway unless one wants to validate the XML document. I'll update this PR. |
