The provided content is related to CVE-2016-15031.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The login form parameter 'myusername' was vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the login form parameter 'myusername'. The original code directly included the username parameter in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or potentially even complete compromise of the application and database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a POST request to the login form by manipulating the 'myusername' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login form and send HTTP requests. No special privileges or position within the network are required.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes SQLMap output demonstrating the SQL injection vulnerability using a boolean-based blind injection technique.
- The vulnerability was remediated by implementing a prepared statement using PDO and binding the username parameter as a named parameter (`:myusername`).
