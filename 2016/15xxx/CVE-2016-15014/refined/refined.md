Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2016-15014:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of the `autocomplete="off"` attribute in the password input field within the password reset form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is that the password field in the reset password form did not have the `autocomplete="off"` attribute set. This allows browsers to save and automatically fill the password field, even when it's for a password reset.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploitation is that a user's new password, which is intended to be known only to them, could be saved by the browser and potentially exposed to unauthorized individuals with access to the user's browser history or saved passwords. It can also be automatically filled in, making it visible during password reset.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a user using a browser with password saving features. The browser could store the newly set password, potentially exposing it through browser history or other means. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would require access to the user's browser (e.g., through malware or direct access to the user's computer) or have access to the user's saved passwords stored by the browser.

**Additional notes:**
The commit message "Fix AutoComplete Not Disabled for 'Password' Field vulnerability" clearly describes the issue being addressed. The provided code snippet shows the addition of the `autocomplete="off"` attribute to the password input field in `/cesnet/core/lostpassword/templates/resetpassword.php`, effectively fixing the vulnerability.
