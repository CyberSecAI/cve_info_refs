The provided content relates to CVE-2016-15010.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of data when using JQuery select2. The `formatResult` and `formatSelection` functions were overridden without proper escaping of data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the interpretation of HTML markup in the `title` field of the group data, and `visibleName` and `crsid` fields of person data, when rendered via JQuery select2.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the lookup data (group titles or user names). When a user interacts with the select2 dropdown, the injected code would be executed within their browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to inject malicious HTML into the data returned by the lookup function. This could happen if the data source for the lookup is compromised or if an attacker could influence the lookup data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to modify or control the data provided by the lookup service used by `django-ucamlookup`. This could be by compromising the database or API used by the lookup functionality.
