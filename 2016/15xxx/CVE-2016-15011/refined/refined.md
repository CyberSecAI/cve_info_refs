Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs because the application was parsing XML documents without disabling the processing of external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The code uses `DocumentBuilderFactory` to parse XML, but it does not explicitly disable the resolution of external entities by default. This allows an attacker to include malicious external entities within the XML input, leading to various attacks.
- The code was parsing XML from `metadataLocation`, which comes from an external source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially read local files on the server, or perform internal network scans.
- **Denial of Service:** By including large external entities, the attacker can cause a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In certain circumstances, XXE can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Input:** An attacker can inject malicious XML code into the `signResponse` or metadata that's being processed by `SignResponseVerifier.java` and `DigitalSignatureServiceMetadata.java` respectively.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the XML data being parsed by the application.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a malicious XML document that can be parsed by the `documentBuilder.parse()` method in both the `SignResponseVerifier.java` and `DigitalSignatureServiceMetadata.java` classes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented in the commit explicitly disables DTD processing using `documentBuilderFactory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);`. This prevents the processing of external entities, effectively mitigating the XXE vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was present in two files: `SignResponseVerifier.java` and `DigitalSignatureServiceMetadata.java`
