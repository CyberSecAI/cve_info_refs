The provided content relates to CVE-2016-15022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection in the `check_system.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `$_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']` variable was being directly outputted to the page without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
  - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to manipulate the `$_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']` variable, likely through a crafted HTTP request or by controlling the server's response header that fills this variable..

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to influence or control the content of the `$_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']` variable. This could involve intercepting and modifying web requests or controlling server settings.
- The attacker would need to have access to the server or a way to cause the vulnerable code to be executed.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for the vulnerability involved using `htmlentities()` to sanitize the output of `$_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']`.
- The commit message specifically mentions "Correct XSS injection in `check_system.php`".
