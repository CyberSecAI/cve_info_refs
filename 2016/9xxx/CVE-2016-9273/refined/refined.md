Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-9273:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `TIFFNumberOfStrips()` function within `libtiff/tif_strip.c`.
*   The function was recomputing the number of strips (`td_nstrips`) instead of using the existing value when `td_nstrips` was non-zero. This was specifically problematic in `TIFF_STRIPCHOP` mode, where `td_nstrips` is modified.
*   This recomputation led to an incorrect number of strips being used in subsequent operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** Due to the incorrect strip count, a heap buffer overflow could occur within the `cpStrips` function in `tiffsplit.c`.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The incorrect calculation in `TIFFNumberOfStrips()` resulted in a read outside of array bounds in `tiffsplit` and potentially other utilities using this function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow could lead to a crash or denial-of-service condition.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The overflow could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application processing the malformed TIFF file, depending on the specifics of the system.
*   **Memory disclosure:** The out of bounds read could potentially leak memory contents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF File:** A specially crafted TIFF file, designed to trigger the vulnerability in `TIFF_STRIPCHOP` mode would be the attack vector. The provided bug report included a sample malformed TIFF file (`malformed.tif`) to demonstrate the issue.
*   The vulnerability occurs in tools using `libtiff`, such as `tiffsplit` tool directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed TIFF file to a user or application that uses the vulnerable libtiff library. This could be achieved through various means like:
    *   Website uploads
    *   Email attachments
    *   Any other method where a crafted TIFF image would be processed by a vulnerable application.
*   No specific system level access is required beyond being able to provide the crafted file.

**Additional Notes**
* The fix involved modifying `TIFFNumberOfStrips()` in `tif_strip.c` to return the cached `td->td_nstrips` value when non-zero, preventing the recomputation.
* The bug was triggered in libtiff 4.0.6.
* AddressSanitizer (ASan) was used to identify the heap-buffer-overflow during testing.
* The fix was introduced in libtiff commit 1.1151 of ChangeLog and 1.37 of `libtiff/tif_strip.c`.
* Debian, Gentoo, and other distributions addressed this vulnerability in their respective security updates by upgrading to libtiff version 4.0.7 or later.
