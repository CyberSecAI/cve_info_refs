The content is related to CVE-2016-9353.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The admin password for Advantech's SUSIAccess Server is encrypted using a static key hard-coded within the program.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Hard-coded static encryption key for admin password.
*   Inadequate protection of sensitive credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Attackers can reverse the encryption to obtain the admin password.
*   This can lead to unauthorized access to the system.
*   Potential for full system compromise (confidentiality, integrity, and availability).

**Attack vectors:**
*   Local access is required to the system running the vulnerable software.
*   The attacker would likely need to have access to the application's executable or memory space to extract the hard-coded key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Local access to the system or ability to obtain a copy of the application files.
*   Ability to reverse engineer/debug the application to extract the hard-coded key.
*   Low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.
