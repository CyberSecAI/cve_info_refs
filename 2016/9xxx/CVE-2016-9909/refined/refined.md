Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `html5lib` library's serializer not properly quoting attribute values that contain specific characters, especially the less-than symbol (`<`) and "weird whitespace" characters. This could lead to unexpected behavior in legacy browsers. Specifically, older browsers might interpret these unquoted values as the start of a new tag or script, potentially resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Attribute Quoting:** The serializer in `html5lib` did not enforce proper quoting of attribute values containing characters like `<`, certain whitespace characters, and the backtick (`) when the `quote_attr_values` option was not set to "always". This behavior is not compliant with HTML5 specification and opened the door for potential XSS issues.
- **Legacy Browser Quirks:** Legacy browsers, particularly older versions of Internet Explorer, had quirks in how they parsed HTML, especially with regards to unquoted attributes and how they handle certain special characters. These quirks could be exploited due to the inadequate quoting.
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The lack of proper quoting enabled an attacker to inject malicious scripts within attribute values, which would then be executed in a victim's browser if the browser had these quirks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages. The impact of XSS includes but is not limited to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulated HTML Input:** An attacker would need to craft an HTML document where attribute values containing the vulnerable characters are present. The input is then processed by the vulnerable `html5lib` library which would not properly quote these values.
- **Serving Malicious HTML:** The attacker could then serve this manipulated HTML to a user, exploiting the quirks in their browser causing the script to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Inject HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML content that can be processed by the vulnerable `html5lib` library. This could be achieved in a variety of ways, depending on the application (e.g., through user input, stored data, or man-in-the-middle attacks).
- **Victim using Legacy Browser:** For the XSS to be successfully triggered, the victim needs to be using a legacy browser with the specific parsing quirks that this vulnerability relies upon.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Specific Characters:** The identified characters that required quoting included space characters, `"` , `'`, `=`, `<`, `>`, and `` ` ``. The full list of problematic characters included:
    - U+0009, U+000A, U+000B, U+000C, U+000D, U+0020, U+002F, U+00A0, U+1680, U+180E, U+180F, U+2000, U+2001, U+2002, U+2003, U+2004, U+2005, U+2006, U+2007, U+2008, U+2009, U+200A, U+2028, U+2029, U+202F, U+205F, U+3000 as whitespace variants
    - U+0000 to U+0020
    - `<` and backtick (`)
- **Mitigation:** The fix for this vulnerability was to introduce a ternary setting for the `quote_attr_values` option within the `html5lib` library, allowing users to select between "legacy-safe", "spec" (HTML5 spec compliant), and "always" quoting of attribute values. The "legacy" option was made the new default, ensuring that these special characters are properly escaped by default.
- **CVE Split:** The CVE assignment team decided to split the original issue into two CVEs:
    - **CVE-2016-9909:** specifically for the mishandling of the `<` character.
    - **CVE-2016-9910:** for the mishandling of all of the other mentioned characters in attribute values.
- **Affected Versions:** This vulnerability affected versions of `html5lib` prior to the fix included in version 0.99999999.
