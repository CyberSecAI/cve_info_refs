Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2016-9854:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from calling certain phpMyAdmin scripts in an unexpected manner, which leads to the display of PHP error messages. These error messages reveal the full path of the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed.
- Additionally, during execution timeouts in the export functionality, errors including the full path are written to the export file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Full Path Disclosure: The primary weakness is the exposure of the server's file system path due to improperly handled errors within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The main impact is information disclosure. Attackers can gain knowledge of the exact location where phpMyAdmin is installed on the server's file system.
- This information can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to aid attacks targeting the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By making specific script calls, an attacker could cause the application to output the full path in an error message.
- By causing the export functionality to timeout, an attacker can cause the application to include the full path in the export file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to interact with the web application in a manner that triggers the error messages or execution timeouts. This likely requires access to the phpMyAdmin interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory classifies this as a "non-critical" vulnerability, likely because it does not directly lead to code execution or data breaches, but provides information that can be useful to an attacker.
- The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201701-32) includes CVE-2016-9854 among a large list of vulnerabilities found in phpMyAdmin.
- The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions prior to 4.6.5 and 4.4.15.9.
