**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to neutralize or encode user-supplied input in the member validation process, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the member validation process.
- Successful exploitation could lead to a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
- The impact is considered "Low Risk".

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could inject malicious javascript code through a user-controlled input during member validation.
- The specific location and method of injection is not provided in the description.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input into the member validation process.
- No specific user role or permission is specified, but likely can be triggered by users attempting to register or modify their account information.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was fixed in MyBB version 1.8.7.
- The vulnerability is described as a "Possible XSS Injection in member validation" which is not a specific technical description.
- The blog post mentions that Tim Coen reported the vulnerability.
