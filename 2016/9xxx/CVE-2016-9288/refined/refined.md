The provided content is related to a commit that fixes a security vulnerability related to page re-ranking in exponent-cms.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to the `DragnDropReRank` function in `framework/modules/navigation/controllers/navigationController.php`. The code uses parameters `$move` and `$target` from `$router->params` to re-rank pages. The original code does not properly sanitize these parameters, potentially leading to an injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code uses `$router->params['move']` and `$router->params['target']` directly without proper sanitization.
- **Potential Injection Vulnerability:** The lack of sanitization of user-provided input `$move` and `$target` could potentially lead to SQL injection. Although, the patch converts these to integer with `intval()`, which is a step to mitigate SQL injection via these parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially manipulate the ranking of pages in the CMS by sending crafted `move` and `target` parameters. This could allow attackers to disrupt the site's navigation structure. If not properly handled, the lack of input sanitization could lead to broader injection attacks, such as SQL injections.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the `DragnDropReRank` function with malicious values for the `move` and `target` parameters. These values would be passed through `$router->params` of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `DragnDropReRank` function and know the structure of the navigation parameters (i.e. `move` and `target` parameters).

**Additional Details:**
- The commit message mentions "fix security vulnerability to reranking pages; reported by kyohpc," indicating that the vulnerability was reported by an external source.
- The code change includes adding `intval` function to the `$move` and `$target` parameters.
