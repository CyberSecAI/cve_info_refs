- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing a remote attacker to inject malicious HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTML injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: The injected HTML code is executed in the victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting site, potentially allowing for a variety of malicious activities, such as defacement, redirection, or session hijacking.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject malicious HTML code through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a low level of privileges (authenticated user) and be able to interact with the web interface. The user needs to be tricked into triggering the vulnerability.
