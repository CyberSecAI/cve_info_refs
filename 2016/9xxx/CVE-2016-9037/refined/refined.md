- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `xrow_header_decode` function within Tarantool. This is due to the function using an attacker-controlled integer from a message as an index into a global array `iproto_key_type` without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read in the `xrow_header_decode` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an out-of-bounds read within the server's memory space.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted network packet to the Tarantool server via its MsgPack protocol. The packet must contain a map type in its header, with at least one key that is an integer greater than the size of the `iproto_key_type` array (0x31).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the Tarantool server. No authentication is required.
