{
  "CVE-2016-9262": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer truncation in the `jas_image_cmpt_create` function of the JasPer library. When handling a crafted image, an integer overflow can occur in the calculation of buffer sizes, which is then truncated when the result is passed as a 32-bit int, leading to a smaller than intended buffer allocation. Later this smaller than intended buffer is accessed out of bounds resulting in a use-after-free condition during reallocation in `jas_realloc`.",
    "Root cause": "Integer truncation in `jas_image_cmpt_create` function while calculating buffer size due to type mismatch which leads to a heap-use-after-free in `jas_realloc`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Integer truncation",
      "Heap-use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image file, potentially leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By opening a specially crafted image file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a specially crafted image file, and to trick a user or automated system using JasPer into opening it."
