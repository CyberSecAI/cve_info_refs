Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-9019:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `activate_address` function within the file `framework/modules/addressbook/controllers/addressController.php`. The `$this->params['is_what']` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection. The `is_what` parameter can be controlled by an attacker and injected into a SQL query, leading to arbitrary SQL execution.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  Although there is an `expString::escape` filter, it can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data.
    *   **Loss of Availability:** Potential to cause denial-of-service by causing database errors.
    *   **Full System Compromise:**  In some cases, SQL injection can lead to further attacks, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `is_what` parameter in the `activate_address` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests with a crafted `is_what` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint of the Exponent CMS application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `framework/modules/addressbook/controllers/addressController.php` file.
*   The `expString::escape` function can be bypassed with payloads like `is_what= "firstname=0x61 where sleep(10)-- a"`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content shows that this vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities in Exponent CMS.
* The suggested fix involves either using a proper SQL injection prevention method, or ensuring that `$is_what` is limited to existing column names.
