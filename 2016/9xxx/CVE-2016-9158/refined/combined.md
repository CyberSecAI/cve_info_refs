## 5. MITIGATIONS

Siemens provides the following firmware versions to resolve CVE-2016-9158:

* SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family: [Update to v3.X.14](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/ps/13752/dl)
* SIMATIC S7-400 PN v6: [Update to v6.0.6](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/de/en/view/109474874)
* SIMATIC S7-400 v7 CPU family: [Update to v7.0.2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109752685)
* SIMATIC S7-410 v8 CPU family: [Update to v8.2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109476571)

Siemens also recommends the following mitigations:

* Deactivate the web server.
* Apply Protection-Level 3 read/write protection.
* Apply cell protection concept.
* Apply defense-in-depth strategies.
* Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells.
* For SIMATIC S7-CPU 410 CPUs: Activate Field Interface Security in PCS 7 V9.0 and use a CP 443-1 Adv. to communicate with ES/OS in order to mitigate vulnerability 2 (CVE-2016-9159).

Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, segmentation, VPN). Siemens also advises that users configure the operational environment according to [Siemens’ Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security).

For more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory [SSA-731239](http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the Siemens SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous
control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries
worldwide.

Products in the SIMATIC S7-400 CPU family have been designed for process control in industrial
environments. They are used worldwide, e.g. in the automotive industry, mechanical equipment manu-
facture, warehousing systems, building engineering, steel industry, power generation and distribution,
pharmaceuticals, food and beverages industry, or chemical industry.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-9158

Specially crafted packets sent to port 80/tcp could cause the affected devices to go into defect mode.
A cold restart is required to recover the system.
