**CVE-2016-9407**

*   **Vulnerability:** Possible XSS Injection in Mod CP logs
*   **Root Cause:**  The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input when displaying Mod CP logs, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*  **Weaknesses:** Improper input sanitization, specifically when handling and displaying data related to Mod CP logs.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users who view the Mod CP logs. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Malicious redirects
    *   Defacement
    *   Other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker would need to inject malicious content in a way that it is logged and then displayed by the Mod CP logs functionality.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to perform an action that is recorded in the Mod CP logs, and that action would need to involve unsanitized input. This could be a malicious moderator action, or a manipulated user action.
