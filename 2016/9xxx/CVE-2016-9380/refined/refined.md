Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9380:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in `pygrub`, the Xen bootloader emulator, when handling the nul-delimited output format. Specifically, `pygrub` fails to properly sanitize or escape data from the bootloader configuration file when generating its output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Delimiter Injection:** When the `--output-format=simple0` is used, `pygrub` outputs the kernel, ramdisk and args separated by a null byte. If the bootloader config file contains null bytes, the output becomes ambiguous because the null byte is not properly escaped or handled, allowing an attacker to inject null bytes and confuse the toolstack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leak:** A malicious guest administrator can inject crafted null bytes into the bootloader config file, causing `pygrub` to generate an output that will make the toolstack treat any file accessible to the toolstack as if it were the guest's initial ramdisk file. This would lead to the disclosure of host file contents to the guest.
- **Denial of Service:** Because the toolstack normally deletes ramdisk files after the guest starts booting, this vulnerability could also lead to arbitrary file deletion on the host system, causing a denial of service.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** In some unusual host configurations, the ability to remove certain files may be used for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious guest administrator can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker would need control of the bootloader configuration file (e.g. via crafted input in grub config files).
- The guest must be configured to use pygrub. This is typically done with `bootloader="pygrub"` in the xl and xm domain configuration files, usually for PV domains on x86 architectures.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have administrative privileges within a guest virtual machine.
- The guest must be configured to use `pygrub` as its bootloader.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch addresses this issue by raising a `RuntimeError` when the delimiter is found in the values when using simple output format.
- The advisory mentions that the newline-delimited output format is safe, as all current bootloader config interpreters read line-based input and don't support escaping.
- The gentoo security advisory GLSA 201612-56 confirms that the vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker with normal severity, and recommends upgrading the affected packages.
