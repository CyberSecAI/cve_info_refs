Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists within the ISC BIND libraries. Specifically, the vulnerability is present in versions 9.1.0 to 9.8.4-P2, 9.8.8, 9.9.3-S1 to 9.9.9-S7, 9.x prior to 9.9.9-P5, 9.9.10b1, 9.10.x prior to 9.10.4-P5, 9.10.5b1, 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.5-S4, 9.10.6-S1 to 9.10.6-S2, 9.11.x prior to 9.11.0-P2, and 9.11.1b1. The specific nature of the flaw in BIND is not detailed in these documents but it is linked to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a vulnerability in the ISC BIND libraries that allows a denial-of-service attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). This means that the affected BIND service will become unavailable, disrupting name resolution for clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted DNS request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable BIND server, thus requiring network access to the server. No authentication is required (PR:N).

**Additional Notes:**

- The NetApp advisory lists this CVE along with several others affecting different versions of BIND.
- The Gentoo advisory mentions that "a remote attacker could send a specially crafted DNS request to the BIND resolver".
- Both sources indicate that this vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.
- Both NetApp and Gentoo provide upgrade guidance as a solution.
- Both sources provide references to the NIST CVE page, as well as other relevant articles.
