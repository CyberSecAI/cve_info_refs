- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing file paths, which allows an attacker to request arbitrary files from the system using path traversal sequences.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22)

- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability to access configuration files, potentially revealing sensitive information.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted URL to the affected device.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected device, with no authentication required. A low level of skill is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
