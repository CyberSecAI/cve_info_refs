Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-9408:

**Root Cause:**

-   The root cause is a lack of sufficient input sanitization or output encoding when handling user input during the user editing process within the Mod CP (Moderator Control Panel).

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which means a malicious script is injected via user input that is not properly sanitized, and is then reflected back to the user in a way that their browser executes it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the user edit form in the Mod CP. When a moderator views or interacts with this user's profile in the Mod CP, the injected script would execute within the moderator's browser.
-   **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker could steal the moderator's session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the administrative functions of the forum.
-   **Other Malicious Activities:** The attacker could perform other actions on behalf of the moderator, such as modifying forum settings, posting content, or even further compromising the system depending on the moderator's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **User Input:** The primary attack vector is via manipulated user input in the user editing function in the Mod CP.
-   **Malicious Payload:** An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload that is embedded within a user profile in such a way that the MyBB system does not prevent the script execution when viewed in the Mod CP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Access to User Profile Editing:** An attacker must have the ability to modify user profiles via either malicious user accounts or via exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject malicious input.
-   **Moderator Interaction:**  The attacker requires a moderator to access the manipulated user profile in the Mod CP in order to trigger the XSS and execute the malicious JavaScript.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability is considered low risk.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in MyBB version 1.8.7.
