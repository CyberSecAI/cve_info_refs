- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A firmware validation flaw in the Gateway ECU of Tesla Model S vehicles allows command injection. This flaw can be exploited when the web browser functionality is enabled in older firmware versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection (CWE-77) vulnerability in the Gateway ECU. This allows for the installation of malicious software and manipulation of the CAN bus.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote control of vehicle software and driving functions via the web browser. This includes the ability to send messages to the vehicle's CAN bus, potentially affecting critical vehicle operations.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation through the vehicle's web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to remotely compromise the web browser in the vehicle (if launched or already running). The attacker then needs to perform local privilege escalation and install custom-built malicious firmware to gain access to the CAN bus. It is noted that this is not trivial and considered difficult.
