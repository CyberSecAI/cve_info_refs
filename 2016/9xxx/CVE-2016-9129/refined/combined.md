Information Exposure Through Discrepancy
----------------------------------------

Karan M. Tank and Smit B. Shah have reported via HackerOne that it was
possible to check whether or not an email address was associated to one or
more user accounts on a target Revive Adserver instance by examining the
message printed by the password recovery system. Such information cannot
however be used directly to log in to the system, which requires usernames
instead.

A CVE-ID has been requested, but not assigned yet.

CWE: CWE-203
CVSSv2: 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2016-001

## Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2016-001

* Advisory ID: [REVIVE-SA-2016-001](https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-001/)
* CVE-IDs: See below
* Date: 2016-03-02
* Risk Level: Medium
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 3.2.2
* Versions not affected: >= 3.2.3
* Website: <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>

## Vulnerability 1 – Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9124](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9124)
* CWE-ID: CWE-307
* CVSSv2: 8.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N)

### Description

Karan M. Tank and Smit B. Shah have reported via HackerOne that the login page of Revive Adserver was vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been introduced as a counter-measure in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress.

## Vulnerability 2 – Session Fixation

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9125](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9125)
* CWE-ID: CWE-384
* CVSSv2: 7.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N)

### Description

The HackerOne users kaviya and Kamini Singh have independently reported that Revive Adserver was vulnerable to session fixation, by allowing arbitrary session identifiers to be forced and, at the same time, by not invalidating the existing session upon a successful authentication. Under some circumstances, that could have been an opportunity for an attacker to steal an authenticated sessions.

## Vulnerability 3 – Persistent XSS

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9126](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9126)
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 5.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N)

### Description

Tengku Zahasman has reported via HackerOne that usernames were not properly escaped when displayed in the audit trail widget of the dashboard upon login, allowing persistent XSS attacks. An authenticated user with enough privileges to create other users could exploit the vulnerability to access the administrator account.

* <https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/8d8c6df309ff5fde9dd4770abcd4ec5d2449b3ec>

## Vulnerability 4 – Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9127](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9127)
* CWE-ID: CWE-352
* CVSSv2: 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

### Description

An undisclosed user has reported via HackerOne that the password recovery form in Revive Adserver was vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This vulnerability could be exploited to send a large number of password recovery emails to the registered users, especially in conjunction with a bug that caused recovery emails to be sent to all the users at once. Both issues have been fixed.

## Vulnerability 5 – Reflected XSS

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9128](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9128)
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 3.5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

### Description

The HackerOne user @decidedlygray has reported that the affiliate-preview.php script in www/admin is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker to steal the session ID of an authenticated user, by tricking them into visiting a specifically crafted URL.

## Vulnerability 6 – Information Exposure Through Discrepancy

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9129](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9129)
* CWE-ID: CWE-203
* CVSSv2: 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

### Description

Karan M. Tank and Smit B. Shah have reported via HackerOne that it was possible to check whether or not an email address was associated to one or more user accounts on a target Revive Adserver instance by examining the message printed by the password recovery system. Such information cannot however be used directly to log in to the system, which requires a username.

* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 3.5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

### Description

Johan Caluwe has reported via HackerOne two vectors for persistent XSS attacks via the Revive Adserver user interface, both requiring a trusted (non-admin) account:

1. the website name wasn’t properly escaped when displayed in the campaign-zone.php script; and
2. the banner image URL for external banners wasn’t properly escaped when displayed in most of the banner related pages.
