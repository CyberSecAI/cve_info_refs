Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-9349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `downloadCSV.jsp` file, specifically within the "file" parameter. This allows an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into the file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw that enables an attacker to access files outside of the intended webroot directory.
- **Information Disclosure:** By traversing directories, attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system leading to sensitive data exposure. This can include configuration files, source code, and potentially credentials.
- In conjunction with other vulnerabilities this could lead to further compromise of the system (file upload via CVE-2016-9351)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/downloadCSV.jsp` endpoint.
- **File Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the "file" parameter within the request URL by inserting directory traversal sequences like `../`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Low Skill Level:** According to the advisory, the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with low skill.
- **No Authentication Required:** The directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Advantech SUSIAccess Server versions 3.0 and prior.
- The exploit-db entry provides a Metasploit module that automates the exploitation.
- The exploit-db entry shows how to craft a request to read arbitrary files using the vulnerability by manipulating the `file` parameter in the `downloadCSV.jsp` endpoint.
- The ICS-CERT advisory assigns CVE-2016-9349 to this vulnerability and mentions a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
