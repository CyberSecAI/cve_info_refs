    {
      "cve": "CVE-2016-9460",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the target directory path in the `_setCurrentDir` function within the `filelist.js` file. Specifically, the function was not properly handling directory traversal sequences like `../`, allowing attackers to potentially access files and directories outside the intended scope.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Path Traversal"
        ],
         "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass access restrictions and access files and directories outside of the intended scope by crafting a malicious URL with directory traversal sequences.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "By crafting a URL containing `../` sequences in the `dir` parameter when accessing the `/apps/files/` endpoint"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and manipulate the URL, which is typically easy to accomplish.",
        "fixes": [
         "The fix involves implementing sanitization logic using `replace` and `_isValidPath` to remove or validate directory traversal sequences before setting the current directory. The code was updated to replace `../` sequences with empty string or `/` and to reject the entire path containing `..`.",
         "Specifically, the fix included these changes:\n- `targetDir = targetDir.replace(/\\\\/g, '/').replace(/\\.\\.\\//g, '');` was changed to `targetDir = targetDir.replace(/\\\\/g, '/').replace(/\\.\\.\\//g, '/');`\n- Adding `if (!this._isValidPath(targetDir)) { targetDir = '/'; changeUrl = true; }`"
