Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9643:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way WebKit handles complex regular expressions, specifically those with a large number of nested capturing groups and repetition quantifiers like `{-2,16}` and `+`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** Parsing and attempting to execute the crafted regular expression causes the affected WebKit browsers to consume excessive amounts of memory, leading to a resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By providing a user with the crafted regex, an attacker could force a vulnerable WebKit-based application or browser to consume excessive memory, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting a web page or other content containing the malicious regex and tricking a user into viewing that content with a vulnerable WebKit-based browser or application.
- **Web Browsers:**  The vulnerability primarily affects web browsers and applications that use the WebKit rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted regular expression to the victim's WebKit-based browser or application. This could be done via a malicious website, or through any medium where a victim can process and render the crafted regex.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the victim's system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content mentions that Chrome and Firefox are not affected, indicating that the issue is specific to WebKit's regex handling implementation.
- The exploit does not involve arbitrary code execution, but does trigger a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- The Gentoo security advisory lists this CVE in a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed by the `net-libs/webkit-gtk` package update.
- The provided email includes the exact regex string triggering the vulnerability.
- The gentoo advisory indicates that a remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition or execute arbitrary code by exploiting a number of different vectors, which includes this specific vulnerability.
